Now since I've blocked him, he has been calling my workplace and telling the receptionist that he'll commit suicide.

The location is Uttar Pradesh (Ghaziabad).\n\nI have a few questions regarding property ownership:\n\t1.\tIf a son and mother are joint owners of a property, and the son suddenly passes away, who becomes the owner of the property? The son is survived by a wife; will the property now be jointly owned by both the mother and the daughter-in-law?\n\n\t2.\tWhen the property was registered, both the son and the mother were listed as joint owners. However, it was mentioned that the registry included a discount due to the woman’s ownership. Does this imply that the registry is in the mother’s name, and that the property will be transferred solely to her?\n\n\t3.\tIf the property is transferred to the mother’s name, does the daughter-in-law have any rights to it?\n\n\t4.\tIf the mother ultimately receives the property, can she transfer it as a gift to her daughter in order to prevent the daughter-in-law from acquiring any rights to it?\n\nLooking forward to any insights!",

        "selftext": "This post is based on my understanding of the **Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill, 2024**. If there are any mistakes or inaccuracies, please let me know in the comments! I'm happy to learn and discuss. 😊\n\n# Uttarakhand Implements Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in 2024\n\nThe Uttarakhand government has introduced the **Uniform Civil Code (UCC)**, making it the first Indian state to adopt a unified legal framework for all its residents. This law simplifies and regulates matters like **marriage, divorce, inheritance**, and **live-in relationships**, ensuring everyone is treated equally under the same set of laws, regardless of their religion or cultural practices.\n\n# Key Points of the UCC\n\n1. **Marriage Rules:**\n   * Both partners must be **unmarried** at the time of marriage.\n   * Minimum age for marriage: **21 years for men, 18 years for women.**\n   * Marriage between close relatives (prohibited relationships) is not allowed unless permitted by specific customs, and those customs must not go against public policy.\n2. **Polygamy Banned:**\n   * Polygamy is **prohibited for everyone**, including communities where it was previously allowed (e.g., Muslim personal laws).\n   * Only **monogamous marriages** will be legally valid under the UCC.\n3. **Mandatory Marriage Registration:**\n   * Every marriage, even if solemnized outside Uttarakhand, must be registered with the authorities if at least one partner is a resident of the state.\n   * Marriages conducted since **2010** must also be registered retroactively.\n4. **Live-in Relationships:**\n   * Couples in live-in relationships must register their partnership within **30 days** of living together.\n   * **Children born from live-in relationships are considered legitimate** and will have inheritance rights.\n   * Women deserted by live-in partners can claim **financial support (maintenance)** through the courts.\n5. **Equal Inheritance Rights:**\n   * Both sons and daughters are given **equal inheritance rights** to their parents’ property, ensuring gender equality.\n6. **Religious Freedom for Ceremonies:**\n   * Couples can marry following their own religious or customary traditions, such as **Saptapadi, Nikah, Holy Union**, or **Anand Karaj.**\n\n# Who Does It Apply To?\n\n* The UCC applies to **all residents of Uttarakhand**, even those living outside the state.\n* **Scheduled Tribes** and groups with **protected customary practices** under the Constitution are exempt from this Code.\n\n# What Changes Under the UCC?\n\nThe UCC replaces personal laws based on religion with a **common set of rules** for everyone. For example:\n\n* Practices like **polygamy** are no longer allowed.\n* There is now a standardized procedure for marriage, divorce, and property inheritance.\n* Women in both marriages and live-in relationships have clear legal protections.\n\nFINE AND IMPRISONMENT \n\n* Under the Uttarakhand UCC, 2024, failing to submit a live-in relationship statement can result in:\n\nFine: Up to ₹10,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 3 months.\n\nProviding false information or ignoring notices can lead to stricter penalties, including:\n\nFine: Up to ₹25,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 6 months.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI need assistance with a passport issue for my father. The problem is related to a name correction in his passport application. Here’s the situation:\n\n* My father already has a passport, but it expired 5 years ago.\n* He renewed his passport in 2009, and at that time, due to a misunderstanding, his name was recorded incorrectly. Specifically, his grandfather’s name (father's father's name) was included, resulting in a trimmed/abbreviated version of his actual name.\n* Now, his old passport has a name that doesn’t match his Aadhaar card or other documents.\n\nWe recently applied for a passport renewal and visited the Passport Seva Kendra with all the necessary documents for a name correction. However, the officer in charge put the application on hold and insisted that we update the name on his Aadhaar card to match the old passport.\n\nWhile changing the name on the Aadhaar card is possible, it would create a ripple effect, as many other documents (bank accounts, property papers, etc.) are linked to the current name on his Aadhaar. This is the name we prefer to maintain, as it’s consistent across all other documents.\n\nOur goal is to correct the name in the passport to match the Aadhaar card, rather than changing the Aadhaar card to match the old passport. Is there any way to achieve this? Has anyone faced a similar situation or have advice on how to resolve this issue?\n\nAny guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\n",

Eventually, I introduced him to my husband and family, but they didn’t like him. However, he didn’t say anything about it at first.**\n\n**When my husband found out I’d been hiding messages, he got extremely angry and started getting violent with me. He says he loves me a lot and is possessive, telling me I shouldn’t talk to anyone else. I tried to fight back, saying I want to continue talking to this person, but then my husband told my family about everything, and things got worse. My mom became physically abusive, and my family started saying awful things to me—things I never imagined they’d say.**\n\n**I feel trapped. My family is now threatening to hurt both me and the person I want to stay in touch with if I leave or continue talking to him. I’m staying with my husband for the sake of my kids, even though I feel completely helpless. The person I wanted to talk to is no longer speaking to me, and my family completely hates both me and him now.**\n\n**I’m terrified to even reach out to him, as my husband is tracking my phone and messages and has been threatening me. I honestly don’t know what to do. All are ignoring me and not letting me leave as well. I feel stuck, scared, and like I have no way out. Does anyone have advice on how to navigate this?**",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI need help understanding what to do in this situation.\n\nThere was a building located on in Kattakada, Thiruvananthapuram, that was severely damaged in a fire in May 2024. It’s in an unsafe condition, with structural instability, burnt debris, and residual oil spills. Despite this, the previous tenant is trying to resume operations there, posing serious risks to public safety.\n\nHere’s what has happened so far:\n\n1. A grievance was filed with the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office, and the issue was forwarded to the District Joint Director (LSGD) and then to the Panchayat.\n\n1. The Panchayat’s investigation report merely stated that “the building is partially ruined” without addressing concerns like structural instability or chemical hazards. No actions have been taken so far.\n\n1. The grievance was closed by the Joint Director's office without verifying if the Panchayat's response addressed the concerns or if any appropriate action was taken.\n\n1. When approached, the Panchayat, the officials said that the Panchayat isn’t responsible for stopping businesses from operating in unsafe premises, but they didn’t clarify which authority is.\n\nI’m not sure what to do next. I’ve contacted multiple authorities, but no action has been taken so far.\n\nMy questions:\n\n* Which authority is responsible for preventing businesses from operating in unsafe buildings in Kerala?\n\n* Should this be escalated to any higher authority?\n\n* Is there any foul play happening? Is that the reason no authority is taking any action?\n\n* How can I ensure that this matter is taken seriously and that action is initiated?\n\nI will attach photos of the burnt building for reference. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!\n\n ",

Apparently, the person who rented my car used it to smuggle a huge quantity of alcohol. Since the smuggler wasn’t caught during the incident, they charged me—the car owner—as an accused.\n\nThe lawyer told me I need to:\n\nGo to Bihar to get bail for my name.\nFile cases in the civil court, DM court, and then the high court to get my car back.\n\nThey also said Zoomcar cannot help me further.\nI hired a lawyer to handle this, but after 9 months, there has been no progress. This situation has taken a massive toll on my mental health. My family, work, and studies are all suffering, and I’m experiencing severe anxiety and depression because of this ordeal.\n\nI feel completely helpless and stuck.

Mr. X also possesses a conveyance deed in his sole ownership.\n\nI financed my purchase through a national bank, and the bank verified all the relevant documents before disbursing the loan.\n\nHowever, in December 2024, after I purchased the property, Mr. Y filed a lawsuit against Mr. X, Builder B, and me. The suit seeks a Declaration of his rights to the property and demands a permanent and mandatory injunction. Mr. X and Builder B are listed as respondents/defendants, while I am also named as a respondent in the suit. I have received the summons for this lawsuit.\n\nWhere do I stand in this case and my ownership of the property. What are the risks involved and what should I do now.",

A few months later, during the demonetization period, my father repaid my aunt ₹10 lakh, which she deposited back into her account at that time.\n\nFast forward a few years, and after missing some notices sent to my aunt, the Income Tax Department has now imposed a fine of nearly ₹13 lakh on the transaction. Under the DTVSV Scheme, they’re asking us to settle the case by paying around ₹9 lakh (which includes unofficial \"bribes\").\n\nWe’re stuck deciding between two options:\na) Pay the amount and move on with a peaceful life.\nb) Hire a good lawyer or CA, which could cost around ₹3 lakh (with no guarantee of winning), and fight the case to prove the legitimacy of the transaction.\n\nI’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts or advice. What would be the wisest course of action in this situation?\n\nEDIT: \n*The withdrawal and deposit is all within a span of 6 months.\n\n*The source of fund are from her pension funds which can be shown in the statements.",

I’ve marked the old wire line with ----. Now, our neighbor also wants to shift the poles to the end of their land along the highway. The last two poles are on our land, forming a straight line perpendicular to the road.\n\nThey are saying it won’t be possible without our cooperation (but I know that even if we don’t shift our pole, which is already on our land away from the highway, the second pole near the highway is in the right place). We can't refuse outright because we live in a village and are expected to cooperate.\n\nThe issue is the total cost. The electricity department has quoted around **₹3.5 lakhs** for the shift. They say we will get an official receipt from the government. Since the poles are on the land of three families (including ours), our share of the cost would be around **₹1.2 lakhs**.\n\nI want to understand the process for this:\n\n1. Can they charge this much?\n2. Is it true that the electricity department installs new poles when shifting old ones?\n\n**Other info:**\n\n* **State**: Uk\n* Why shift - We currently have no problem with the poles being on our land since the area is used for farming. However, some neighbors have built buildings nearby, so they are the ones who want this shift.\n* The poles don’t supply electricity to the village (not sure), but I think they are primarily for factories using high-voltage lines.",

Well, okay. Assuming it is true, fine. \nBUT. \nThey have CLEARLY CUT SO MUCH MORE THAN NECESSARY.

It's so incredibly wrong. 20+ years of strong, beautiful, lush green trees just cut down. These stupid men and women don't realise that these very trees provided shade in summers, which are increasingly unbearable each year. \n\nI want to slap some legal on the society management so that they know things dont go without consequences.

        "selftext": "We are a Muslim family from Maharashtra, and I am sharing my sister’s painful story. She was married in 2020 through an arranged marriage. The groom’s family seemed educated but turned out to be extremely controlling and orthodox. From the very first day, my sister faced mental and physical abuse.\n\nHere’s what she went through:\n\n1. **No Freedom from Day One:** On the first day after her wedding, her in-laws took away her phone and sent it back to us. When she asked her husband, he told her that daughters-in-law in their house are not allowed to have phones and she should use his phone instead. To avoid arguments, my sister gave up her phone and her connection to the outside world.\n2. **Total Control Over Her Life:** Her in-laws controlled everything—what she wore, who she talked to, what she ate, even how and when she laughed.\n3. **No Respect in Her Marriage:** Her husband ignored her completely. He spent most of his time with a girl named \"Gudiya,\" who lived with the family but wasn’t related to them. Shockingly, they even shared my sister’s bed while she was forced to sleep on the floor. He avoided talking to her and came home late at night to avoid any confrontation.\n4. **Her Career Dreams Crushed:** My sister is highly qualified (MA in Geography and B.Ed) and wanted to become a professor. Her husband was also a teacher before their marriage, so we thought he would support her dreams. But after marriage, she found out he had quit his job because his mother told him to. When she tried to prepare for exams like NET/SET, her sister-in-law created drama and stopped her from studying.\n5. **No Healthcare or Basic Dignity:** If she fell sick, she was mocked for being weak. They refused to take her to the doctor unless her condition was serious.\n6. **Gold and Dowry Demands:** Her in-laws constantly praised their elder daughter-in-law for bringing dowry and gold every month. They took all the gold my sister brought with her and kept it in a bank without her consent.\n\nShe silently endured this abuse for two years before finally telling us everything. We immediately filed a domestic violence case against her in-laws and husband.\n\n**Legal Struggles**\n\nSince filing the case, her in-laws have avoided every court hearing by manipulating the police and the system. Over a year has passed, and they haven’t attended a single hearing. Meanwhile, my sister has to go to every hearing, reliving her trauma.\n\nEven when a non-bailable warrant was issued, they managed to escape. Their lawyer even got permission for them to skip court appearances. The judge handling the case seems hesitant to take any action, leaving my sister stuck.\n\nTo make things worse, during this time, her husband secretly married another woman without my sister’s consent. While he lives happily, my sister is left to deal with endless legal battles and mental pain.\n\nWe once thought of settling the matter out of court to get her a divorce, but her in-laws refused. They want to “set an example” for other daughters-in-law, showing what happens if they speak out.\n\n**We are desperate for help.** All we want is for my sister to get a divorce and move on with her life.\n\n**Questions We Need Help With:**\n\n1. How can we speed up the court process and make sure her in-laws and husband are held responsible?\n2. What legal steps can we take to secure a divorce and protect her future?\n3. How do we fight the manipulation of the police and courts by her in-laws?\n4. Can stricter action be taken against her husband for marrying another woman without her consent?\n\nPlease help us. My sister deserves a chance to live her life with dignity and hope.",

I can't imagine this ending in any way other than divorce. Whether it's next week or 5 years from now, it will happen.\n\nQuestion: How do I keep myself prepared. I know I can contact a divorce lawyer, but what about other things like removing her as the beneficiary from my investments, how do I handle my daughter's schooling, what about all the documents where she is mentioned as my wife. Would a divorce lawyer help me with these?\n\nIn case it matters, we are Muslims. No official marriage certificate but there's a nikahnama and her name is on my passport.",

Please feel free to give any info about individual points as well. \n\n1) So A is the only one in possession of the original will and all other survey papers (at least claims to be) and with his he is always encroaching everyone’s property by stating that XYZ have built houses outside the boundaries. \n\nI figure I can get the survey results through a legal process, but the will and other documents, is there a legal process to request him to share all documents that he claims to be the sources with others?\n\n2) A and XYZ agreed to give the said property to a builder for development purposes in 2001. There was some advance money paid out by the builder and there was no development started by the developer in a long time. Since XYZ had no employment, they took out several more advances throughout the years from the said builder, now 20 years later, there is still no development and even though we’re willing to pay the money back (even with interest) the developer isn’t make any progress. \n\nWhat can we do in this situation? \n\nThis has been going on since I was a kid and now I earn quite well and I want to help my dad using some money I can spend. It’s been really hard to see him struggle with his relatives. Any input or suggestions of legal teams are welcome! Thank you for taking the time to read!  ",

        "selftext": "Hi,   \n  \nI want to know certain things. I have been living in rent in a property managed by The Helloworld Coliving in Mumbai. I am facing a fundamental necessity issue, which is drinking water, for which they were supposed to put up a water purifier on the property. They provide water that the property's caretaker refills from another property, and a 20ltr can be used for five people. I have faced multiple issues, such as   \n1. Refilling the water from my friend's place.   \n2. No water available in the middle of the night  \n3. The caretaker not being available to get water, which I have to purchase from Blinkit  \n  \nI had raised multiple complaints with their support team, but they closed the ticket without providing an update or getting a customer response. Their customer service number is provided on the website. I called multiple times, but no one answered the calls. Sometimes, someone responded, but they lack basic essentialnication and accountability. \n\nThe biggest culprit is the property manager; I am sure he has never visited the property. He does most of his work via phone like a mafia boss. Most of the time, he has made false promises and no accountability. Whenever an issue is raised in a call, he gives vague timelines like \"it will be done\". And the biggest irony is that there is only one property manager for the entire location. The support team mainly contacts the property manager to resolve tickets. IItis like a Ponzi scheme where the issue goes completely unheard. I am paying 30k as rent for one single room; I mean, there is a TV, a F#\\*\\*ING TV in the amenities, which is entirely useless but no Water Purifier. The management should be pretty dumb and lame to come up with this.\n\n  \nNow the reason I am facing eviction is I have already mentioned to the support team on email that I will be withholding my rent payment until my issue is fixed which they don't seem to care about as they closed those support tickets which I have raised saying the issue has been fixed but in ground reality nothing's been done. I am clear that when I signed the agreement Water Purifer was part of the amenities that they were supposed to provide. What should I do in this case?",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI need some legal advice regarding a complicated situation.\n\nBackground: I come from a lower-income family. My mother left me immediately when I was born due to psychiatric issues and has lived with her parents for over 25 years. Dad tried applying for divorce, but with no address, no answer or response, he didn't get the divorce. I grew up with my father’s parents, who passed away in 2018.\n\nAfter 15+ years of waiting, My dad (58) found a live-in partner in 2010 who agreed to live without divorce or marriage initially.. She (40) a divorcee with two kids from her first marriage. She didn't tell anything and all lies about her first husband being drunkard and so on. \nThings went downhill quickly with her living in my home— within 1 month my grandparents started losing things, theft, bad behavior, and targeting on property. Whenever dad is at home she acts like an angel with me and grandparents.\n\nGrandparents kicked her out within 1 month and my dad and she have lived separately since 2012 in a rented home.\n\nI am disabled and 90% deaf, and I live in the house my grandparents built in Bangalore. My dad visits daily to help me out with household chores.\n\nIn 2015, dad discovered she had an affair in her first marriage that led to her divorce. Even with dad she had affairs late night talks and dad once caught a guy in home when she was alone. She just brushed it off saying friends. \n\nIn 2017, she had lung cancer, which she made my dad financially supported for operation and recovery.\n\nIn 2018, she had medical treatment to conceive again and ended up having a child without my dad’s decision as well. We don't even know if the kid belongs to dad. She hid this news until the 6th month.\n\nIn 2021, they had a violent fight, leading to police involvement. She took the child and ran to Kerala. She’s using the child to emotionally blackmail dad and has sent legal notices to my address claiming dowry and demanding to live in my home. Despite her issues, people seem to side with her. She tried to barge into my home and dad tried to push her out, leading to my name being included in an FIR.\n\nNow, in 2025, a similar fight happened in their rental home and police were called again.\n\nShe’s sending more legal notices through lawyers in Kerala and demands my dad appear before the Kerala Vanitha Committee on a date. \nThis notice came through my home address and dad unknowingly signed and took the letter, later he was regretting he should not have taken in my home address. \n\nThe latest issue is that she wants to live in my home, as my dad has no income.\nAnd she wants dad to marry her in order to see the child or to be in peace, else she would work on creating issues. \n\nMy dad has a small 1BHK near Electronic City around agricultural land, but she refuses to live there and insists on coming to my home.\n\nShe is also trying to involve me in all this and I suspect she'll again try to enter my home forcefully to live in.\n\nI’m already struggling with my disability unable to work effectively, lost my future, and finances aspects, and now the added legal fees and headache are difficult to pay. \n\nMy home is still in my grandparents' name, and I need to settle a amount as per will with my dad's sister to own it in my name which i am yet to do. \n\nWhat can I legally do to stop her from sending these notices and pulling me into this mess?\nCan i send a return notice to not disturb me and my dad does not stay here in my home? \n\nI don’t want her to stay in my home. Should I send a response to the lawyer stating my dad doesn’t live with me full-time? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nI’m also worried for my dad, who is 58 and having knee issues and worsening health not sure what kind of trouble will he be in. \nHow can i help my dad here. I know he did msny mistakes. But he supports me and understand my issues and try to help me as much as possible. \n\nI have no one to approach or ask for help, no relatives would come in for help unless there is a death. ",

We tried to talk them out of it but they didn't respond positively. \n1. Since my sister was stressed, we were looking after her Insta account. \n1. Around the same time, my sister's old friend who had a new Instagram account also messaged her. We didn't know it was a friend. We thought it was one of the miscreants. Some rude messages were exchanged and then that person (friend) stopped. \n1. We filed an FIR against all the 4 anonymous Insta accounts. \n1. The police got their real names from Meta company. \n1. We also managed to get the names of the account owners from the cops. 2 people who had a quarrel with my sister and 1 old friend (that's how we came to know about the friend's new account). \n1.

Background:\n\nI applied for a teaching post where the notification mentioned that only candidates with a B.Ed. in Special Education are eligible.\n\nHowever, I knew the qualifications mentioned in the notification were incomplete because, based on past vacancies, candidates with a graduation + special diploma (recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India, RCI) were also eligible.\n\nThe RCI is the only body authorized to decide eligibility criteria for such posts, not the government.\n\n\n\n2. My Qualifications at the Time:\n\nI had a special diploma and was pursuing my graduation. However, my graduation was incomplete at the time of application.\n\nDespite this, I filled out the form, sat for the exam, and scored more than 20 marks above the cutoff (in the 2x result list).\n\n\n\n3. Current Scenario:\n\nI did not attend document verification because I had not completed my graduation by the last date of application, as per the notification’s criteria. , also government was only allowing special bed candidates\n\nMeanwhile, the government sought clarification from the RCI regarding qualifications, and the RCI confirmed that diploma holders (like me) are also valid for the post.\n\nAnd after 6-8 months due to some answers get changed, 2x result was canceled, and a new, fresh result was released today. My roll number is still in this list.\n\n\n\n4. Dilemma:\n\nThe notification clearly stated that all qualifications must be completed by the last date of application, which I did not meet.\n\nHowever, I believe I am eligible for the post based on RCI's clarification and past precedence.\n\nI desperately need this job, and I worked incredibly hard for it.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\nDo I have a strong case if I file a court petition?\n\nWhat legal arguments can I make to strengthen my case?\n\nAre there any past judgments or legal principles that could support my claim?\n\n\nI understand my chances might be slim, but I want to explore all possible options.

Unfortunately, all the items had some issue or the other in terms of size and fit so I decided to return it. I raised a request to return the items on 30th Dec and my order was picked up by a Delhivery guy on 31st Dec 2024. The person who picked it up was behaving very strangely. As he went through each item to confirm everything was there with all tags intact, he kept asking me the total value of the order and saying \"Ye order toh kaafi mehenga hoga na madam?\" \nI didn't respond and asked him to verify if it was him who was supposed to pick it up. And he said yes and that it was his first day of work so he is new to all this. I verified his phone number from the Delhivery app and then handed him my entire parcel. I later got an email from Delhivery that day that my order was picked up. \n\nOn 3rd Jan 2025, I received and email from Delhivery that my parcel was returned to Zara warehouse. Usually, when we return items to Zara, we get an email from them confirming that they have received it and the refund will be processed. I kept waiting for that email but didn't get one. I contacted Zara's customer service on 10th Jan 2025 and they told me they had only received one sweater in the parcel and it was a non-Zara item so they will not be giving me a refund. I have been chasing them ever since through calls every other day and their executives keep telling me to wait for 24-48 hours as my case has been expedited. But it's going to be month since I returned all the items. \n\nI have my suspicions that the Delhivery pickup guy stole my parcel and handed them random item. But I have not even been able to reach out to Delhivery since they deactivate their AWBs within 15 days. And their automated customer service says to contact the seller. And Zara has been utterly useless in those terms. \n\nI really need my money back. \n\nIs this worth filing a case in consumer court? How can we do it? Or is there any other way I can get them to give my refund. ",

        "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nThanks in advance for reading this huge wall of text :)\n\nA family member of mine booked a wedding hall/banquet situated in Sec 56 Gurgaon on July 7th 2024. They paid 90000 as a booking amount of the total Rs 3,15,000 (Food and Venue only, no decoration.). \n\nThey had booked the pool side venue, however at the time of booking, the pool was operational for members and functions were not being conducted. The Salesperson told us that we can come in November to look at their poolside functions to finalize our decoration.\n\nFast forward to end of November, we had not heard anything from the sales person, and after following up with her multiple times to give us a time to visit the venue for tasting and to see the decoration, she finally gave us a date of Dec 4th. She had informed us that there would be a wedding function in the eve of 4th Dec where we can see sample decoration and taste the food. \n\nWhen on Dec 4th we reached the venue, it was in an ABYSSMAL condition. It looked like they were taking apart the decoration instead of putting it up. Keep in mind that we went there at 8 pm, and the wedding guests had almost started to arrive. \n\nThe entire venue was covered in used straws and disposable spoons/plates, maybe from the day before function and nobody had bothered cleaning it up. The sofa for the bride and groom was dirty and torn and had food/stains marks all over. The low chairs for the bride and groom during pheras, were dirty, and had holes in them. Without getting into more details, it was a very horrible setup.\n\nNow based on all of this, we decided to confront the sales lady (who had been trying to avoid us the entire time btw), and we told them to cancel the venue. \n\nWe had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. With to and fro with the venue management, we were able to get them to send an email to us stating that they will refund \"the amount that we paid at the time of booking\" and that we can expect the refund in 3rd week of January 2025. \n\nHowever, since passing of 3rd week of Jan 2025, they have stopped responding and keep saying that they will send a final date soon. \n\nTldr: A family member booked a poolside wedding venue in Sec 56, Gurgaon, for July 7, 2024, paying ₹90,000 upfront (total ₹3,15,000). The salesperson promised a visit in November to view decorations and food tasting, but after delays, they finally scheduled it for Dec 4. Upon visiting, the venue was in terrible condition—dirty, torn furniture, and no proper setup despite an ongoing event. The family decided to cancel, however they had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. Upon negotiations, the family got an email confirmation of a refund with the venue management. The venue promised a refund by mid-Jan 2025 but has since stopped responding and delayed giving a final refund date. \n\nWhat legal steps can the family take to recover this amount? \n\n",

It’s going to be little long but he actually needs help so please read\n\nHe met a girl in 2019 they fell in love and started living together later he got to know that she was married but she said they got divorced and he trusted her! Then 6 months into the relationship she was after him to get married within 5-10 days as her mother was sick and there won’t be any auspicious day after 30th of some month i don’t remember. He tried to explain her that marriage doesn’t happen quickly and he doesn’t earn enough to be married and he also want big wedding someday! But she kept forcing him by saying I don’t care about big wedding i want small wedding!\nIt was just after lockdown and they got married in Arya samaj.\n\nAfter 1 year of marriage she started behaving controlling like leave your friends stay home with me all the time! Mind that she was 5-6 years older to him, he didn’t want to leave his friends and wanted to drink occasionally  with his friends but whenever he made plans she threatened him by saying i will jump from the building or i will cut my hand!\n\nBefore this threatening happened, my friend bought a house on his name and made his wife the nominee! But later on he could not take all this and he ran off!\n\nIt’s been 3 years since he has left his own home! She took all the stuff from the house which had some very expensive stuff also! She took property papers too which is in her bank locker! \n\nWhen she didn’t respond to mutual divorce! My friend met a girl and have been living with her and wants to marry her so he decided to talk to an advocate! Now he got to know she was married before but never divorced her first husband! Lawyer told him if my friend wants to marry again he can but he needs to forget about his own house any all the stuff including money in joint account with her!\n\nNow finally his wife filled a complaint saying he tortured her basically 498 or something! And she also included his mother and sister in it when he has been living away from family for past 11 years and she met the family twice only that too for lunch or dinner only!\n\nSo he wants to know that she can take away his home and joint account money? Which is his only asset as his family doesn’t talk to him and have nothing else. And as she is not divorced before so can she still claim everything ?",

There's plenty of proof here - [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/wx2opz/the_headband_on_my_q30_headphones_broke_after_a/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/lhcei6/soundcore_q30_design_flaw_the_plastic_clips_next/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/xlvwjj/another_broken_soundcore_q30/) [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/187blhc/soundcore_q30_part_broke/) [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/nv4jhk/my_soundcore_q30_broke_always_felt_right_side_was/)\n\nI contacted Anker regarding the 18 Month Warranty claim since a good few people got a new pair after the brittle plastic headband broke the same way, or at least that's what they claimed on their respective reddit threads. I contacted them via email regarding the same and I was shocked by their reply. They said and I quote - \n\n\"I'm sorry to hear about the damage to your product. Unfortunately, according to our policy, we do not provide a warranty if the product is damaged or lost due to improper use. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.\"\n\nIt's not even due to outside damage or misuse which they mention in their warranty terms, it's literally the cheap quality of plastic used in the headband. Also if it's not covered under the warranty claim, then why replace them for customers outside of India? This is a well known defect and they've very much acknowledged it in the past as well, I am positively mystified at this remark.\n\nIs there something I can do legally to get them to honor this warranty claim? Seems like they've shut down my ticket too.",

Grandma is still alive and apparently grandpa didn’t leave anything for her or us according to uncle. He just showed us the first page of the document and has stopped responding to the entire family and is refusing to show the entire gift deed/ will. \n\nFor context, my dad supported my grandpa financially when he was alive and looked after his medical expenses/ insurance. But their relationship grew distant in the past few years, chiefly due to grandpa’s orthodox mindset.\n\nLawyer is telling us to find out exact date of registration of gift deed but we have no idea as the witness was paid off by uncle. Any suggestions how to proceed? Gift deed was signed in a tier 3 city and my family is in a separate megacity so travel will have to be planned properly. ",

        "selftext": "Context:\n\nMy mother is a Physical Education teacher at a government school in Bengaluru.\n\nAfter the Republic Day celebrations, she visited her school in the evening to take down and fold the national flag.\n\n\nWhat Happened:\n\n1. She discovered that massive, decades-old trees on the school campus had been cut down.\n\n\n2. The school headmaster had permission to cut only one dead/dried-out tree and this was done by the concerned authorities by following the procedure few days back\n\n\n3. But yesterday (26/1/25) me and my mom saw that the headmaster has illegally cut two healthy trees without proper authorization (she wasn't present at the sight) and we have a video evidence of the man admitting that the headmaster has payed him to cut.\n\n\n4. The wood from these trees is very valuable and is intended for personal profit.\n\n\n5. As per procedure, tree-felling requires permission from BBMP or the Karnataka Forest Department, who also handle the cutting and removal process. This wasn’t followed.\n\n\n6. My mother recorded videos of the site as evidence and is considering filing a complaint.\n\n\n\nMy Concerns:\n\nIf my mother or I escalate this (e.g., filing a complaint or posting on Twitter), could we face any legal trouble or retaliation from the school/headmaster?\n\nIs there any other legal procedure or body we should approach to address this?\n\n\nKey Questions for Advice:\n\n1. What are the potential legal risks for us if we take this forward?\n\n\n2. What steps should we take to ensure this is handled legally and safely?\n\n\n3. Is there any way to ensure anonymity for my mother while filing the complaint? I'm planning to post this on X(twitter) since benguluru police are active there from what I know ",

The son is survived by a wife; will the property now be jointly owned by both the mother and the daughter-in-law?\n\n\t2.\tWhen the property was registered, both the son and the mother were listed as joint owners. However, it was mentioned that the registry included a discount due to the woman’s ownership. Does this imply that the registry is in the mother’s name, and that the property will be transferred solely to her?\n\n\t3.\tIf the property is transferred to the mother’s name, does the daughter-in-law have any rights to it?\n\n\t4.\tIf the mother ultimately receives the property, can she transfer it as a gift to her daughter in order to prevent the daughter-in-law from acquiring any rights to it?\n\nLooking forward to any insights!",

        "selftext": "I had booked a bus ticket for two through redBus for a journey from Ahmedabad to Pune on January 27th for a whopping inflated price of ₹7000 (due to coldplay concert). The original departure time was 8:05 PM. However, on the same day of travel, at 10:17 AM, I received an email from the bus operator stating that the bus had been rescheduled and preponed to 6:05 PM.\n\nThere was no way I could have made it 2 hours earlier than what I had initially planned because I was travelling from Porbandar. When I contacted the bus operator, they could only offer an alternate bus for the next day, which was not a feasible option for me. \n\nI reached out to redBus support for help. The redBus team suggested that I book another ticket on my own while they escalated the issue for a refund, asking me to wait 48 hours for a resolution. However, within just 1 hour of filing the complaint, they marked it as ‘Resolved’ and denied the refund. They claimed that the bus operator provided a “reasonable” solution to me. They didn’t even mention what was the “reasonable” solution provided.\n\nSince then, I’ve been going back and forth with redBus support but haven’t received any resolution.\n\nAny advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.",

So the latest agreement is over a month old.\n\nHowever, the landlord in question has not been paying the society maintenance charges for a year now. In addition, a couple of days ago, I also received a Property Tax Demand (Rs. 16K or so) from the BMC meaning he hasn't been paying that either. I have been forwarding these to him over WhatsApp.\n\nThe society office is on my side, and are asking me not to pay the rent for the next month (I planned to pay it as per schedule on Feb 5). They say this will put adequate pressure on him to turn up and clear their bill. Should I proceed with not paying?\n\nAlso, I don't want to deal with this headache anyway - can I just take the hit on my security deposit and walk away, no questions asked? The security deposit is worth approx 3 months of rent. The agreement has a clause saying there is a lock-in period of 6 months, but it also states in another part that the landlord is responsible for paying all the bills. \n\nWhat should I do?",

        "selftext": "This post is based on my understanding of the **Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill, 2024**. If there are any mistakes or inaccuracies, please let me know in the comments! I'm happy to learn and discuss. 😊\n\n# Uttarakhand Implements Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in 2024\n\nThe Uttarakhand government has introduced the **Uniform Civil Code (UCC)**, making it the first Indian state to adopt a unified legal framework for all its residents. This law simplifies and regulates matters like **marriage, divorce, inheritance**, and **live-in relationships**, ensuring everyone is treated equally under the same set of laws, regardless of their religion or cultural practices.\n\n# Key Points of the UCC\n\n1. **Marriage Rules:**\n   * Both partners must be **unmarried** at the time of marriage.\n   * Minimum age for marriage: **21 years for men, 18 years for women.**\n   * Marriage between close relatives (prohibited relationships) is not allowed unless permitted by specific customs, and those customs must not go against public policy.\n2. **Polygamy Banned:**\n   * Polygamy is **prohibited for everyone**, including communities where it was previously allowed (e.g., Muslim personal laws).\n   * Only **monogamous marriages** will be legally valid under the UCC.\n3. **Mandatory Marriage Registration:**\n   * Every marriage, even if solemnized outside Uttarakhand, must be registered with the authorities if at least one partner is a resident of the state.\n   * Marriages conducted since **2010** must also be registered retroactively.\n4. **Live-in Relationships:**\n   * Couples in live-in relationships must register their partnership within **30 days** of living together.\n   * **Children born from live-in relationships are considered legitimate** and will have inheritance rights.\n   * Women deserted by live-in partners can claim **financial support (maintenance)** through the courts.\n5. **Equal Inheritance Rights:**\n   * Both sons and daughters are given **equal inheritance rights** to their parents’ property, ensuring gender equality.\n6. **Religious Freedom for Ceremonies:**\n   * Couples can marry following their own religious or customary traditions, such as **Saptapadi, Nikah, Holy Union**, or **Anand Karaj.**\n\n# Who Does It Apply To?\n\n* The UCC applies to **all residents of Uttarakhand**, even those living outside the state.\n* **Scheduled Tribes** and groups with **protected customary practices** under the Constitution are exempt from this Code.\n\n# What Changes Under the UCC?\n\nThe UCC replaces personal laws based on religion with a **common set of rules** for everyone. For example:\n\n* Practices like **polygamy** are no longer allowed.\n* There is now a standardized procedure for marriage, divorce, and property inheritance.\n* Women in both marriages and live-in relationships have clear legal protections.\n\nFINE AND IMPRISONMENT \n\n* Under the Uttarakhand UCC, 2024, failing to submit a live-in relationship statement can result in:\n\nFine: Up to ₹10,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 3 months.\n\nProviding false information or ignoring notices can lead to stricter penalties, including:\n\nFine: Up to ₹25,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 6 months.",

Here’s the situation:\n\n* My father already has a passport, but it expired 5 years ago.\n* He renewed his passport in 2009, and at that time, due to a misunderstanding, his name was recorded incorrectly. Specifically, his grandfather’s name (father's father's name) was included, resulting in a trimmed/abbreviated version of his actual name.\n* Now, his old passport has a name that doesn’t match his Aadhaar card or other documents.\n\nWe recently applied for a passport renewal and visited the Passport Seva Kendra with all the necessary documents for a name correction. However, the officer in charge put the application on hold and insisted that we update the name on his Aadhaar card to match the old passport.\n\nWhile changing the name on the Aadhaar card is possible, it would create a ripple effect, as many other documents (bank accounts, property papers, etc.) are linked to the current name on his Aadhaar. This is the name we prefer to maintain, as it’s consistent across all other documents.\n\nOur goal is to correct the name in the passport to match the Aadhaar card, rather than changing the Aadhaar card to match the old passport. Is there any way to achieve this? Has anyone faced a similar situation or have advice on how to resolve this issue?\n\nAny guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

He says he loves me a lot and is possessive, telling me I shouldn’t talk to anyone else. I tried to fight back, saying I want to continue talking to this person, but then my husband told my family about everything, and things got worse. My mom became physically abusive, and my family started saying awful things to me—things I never imagined they’d say.**\n\n**I feel trapped. My family is now threatening to hurt both me and the person I want to stay in touch with if I leave or continue talking to him.

It’s in an unsafe condition, with structural instability, burnt debris, and residual oil spills. Despite this, the previous tenant is trying to resume operations there, posing serious risks to public safety.\n\nHere’s what has happened so far:\n\n1. A grievance was filed with the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office, and the issue was forwarded to the District Joint Director (LSGD) and then to the Panchayat.\n\n1. The Panchayat’s investigation report merely stated that “the building is partially ruined” without addressing concerns like structural instability or chemical hazards. No actions have been taken so far.\n\n1. The grievance was closed by the Joint Director's office without verifying if the Panchayat's response addressed the concerns or if any appropriate action was taken.\n\n1. When approached, the Panchayat, the officials said that the Panchayat isn’t responsible for stopping businesses from operating in unsafe premises, but they didn’t clarify which authority is.\n\nI’m not sure what to do next. I’ve contacted multiple authorities, but no action has been taken so far.\n\nMy questions:\n\n* Which authority is responsible for preventing businesses from operating in unsafe buildings in Kerala?\n\n* Should this be escalated to any higher authority?\n\n* Is there any foul play happening? Is that the reason no authority is taking any action?\n\n* How can I ensure that this matter is taken seriously and that action is initiated?\n\nI will attach photos of the burnt building for reference. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!\n\n ",

What proofs will I need for this? \n\nThe reasons why I want to sue them are: \n1. Level out the disrespect they dished out at me\n2. Do justice to their daughter \n3. Make her extended family \"seriously\" aware of her condition so they can atleast be a support system when I'm gone ",

Since then, I have not gotten my car back. It’s been almost 9 months, and dealing with Zoomcar has been a nightmare.\n\nAfter repeated attempts to get in touch, their lawyer finally called me and informed me that my car has been impounded by the Bihar police. Apparently, the person who rented my car used it to smuggle a huge quantity of alcohol. Since the smuggler wasn’t caught during the incident, they charged me—the car owner—as an accused.\n\nThe lawyer told me I need to:\n\nGo to Bihar to get bail for my name.\nFile cases in the civil court, DM court, and then the high court to get my car back.\n\nThey also said Zoomcar cannot help me further.\nI hired a lawyer to handle this, but after 9 months, there has been no progress. This situation has taken a massive toll on my mental health. My family, work, and studies are all suffering, and I’m experiencing severe anxiety and depression because of this ordeal.\n\nI feel completely helpless and stuck. Has anyone faced a similar issue or can guide me on what to do next? Are there any legal steps I can take against Zoomcar for their negligence or lack of support?\n\nAny advice or suggestions would mean the world to me. Thank you in advance!\n",

I’ve marked the old wire line with ----. Now, our neighbor also wants to shift the poles to the end of their land along the highway. The last two poles are on our land, forming a straight line perpendicular to the road.\n\nThey are saying it won’t be possible without our cooperation (but I know that even if we don’t shift our pole, which is already on our land away from the highway, the second pole near the highway is in the right place). We can't refuse outright because we live in a village and are expected to cooperate.\n\nThe issue is the total cost. The electricity department has quoted around **₹3.5 lakhs** for the shift. They say we will get an official receipt from the government. Since the poles are on the land of three families (including ours), our share of the cost would be around **₹1.2 lakhs**.\n\nI want to understand the process for this:\n\n1. Can they charge this much?\n2. Is it true that the electricity department installs new poles when shifting old ones?\n\n**Other info:**\n\n* **State**: Uk\n* Why shift - We currently have no problem with the poles being on our land since the area is used for farming. However, some neighbors have built buildings nearby, so they are the ones who want this shift.\n* The poles don’t supply electricity to the village (not sure), but I think they are primarily for factories using high-voltage lines.",

From the very first day, my sister faced mental and physical abuse.\n\nHere’s what she went through:\n\n1. **No Freedom from Day One:** On the first day after her wedding, her in-laws took away her phone and sent it back to us. When she asked her husband, he told her that daughters-in-law in their house are not allowed to have phones and she should use his phone instead. To avoid arguments, my sister gave up her phone and her connection to the outside world.\n2. **Total Control Over Her Life:** Her in-laws controlled everything—what she wore, who she talked to, what she ate, even how and when she laughed.\n3. **No Respect in Her Marriage:** Her husband ignored her completely. He spent most of his time with a girl named \"Gudiya,\" who lived with the family but wasn’t related to them. Shockingly, they even shared my sister’s bed while she was forced to sleep on the floor. He avoided talking to her and came home late at night to avoid any confrontation.\n4. **Her Career Dreams Crushed:** My sister is highly qualified (MA in Geography and B.Ed) and wanted to become a professor. Her husband was also a teacher before their marriage, so we thought he would support her dreams. But after marriage, she found out he had quit his job because his mother told him to. When she tried to prepare for exams like NET/SET, her sister-in-law created drama and stopped her from studying.\n5. **No Healthcare or Basic Dignity:** If she fell sick, she was mocked for being weak. They refused to take her to the doctor unless her condition was serious.\n6. **Gold and Dowry Demands:** Her in-laws constantly praised their elder daughter-in-law for bringing dowry and gold every month. They took all the gold my sister brought with her and kept it in a bank without her consent.\n\nShe silently endured this abuse for two years before finally telling us everything. We immediately filed a domestic violence case against her in-laws and husband.\n\n**Legal Struggles**\n\nSince filing the case, her in-laws have avoided every court hearing by manipulating the police and the system. Over a year has passed, and they haven’t attended a single hearing. Meanwhile, my sister has to go to every hearing, reliving her trauma.\n\nEven when a non-bailable warrant was issued, they managed to escape. Their lawyer even got permission for them to skip court appearances. The judge handling the case seems hesitant to take any action, leaving my sister stuck.\n\nTo make things worse, during this time, her husband secretly married another woman without my sister’s consent. While he lives happily, my sister is left to deal with endless legal battles and mental pain.\n\nWe once thought of settling the matter out of court to get her a divorce, but her in-laws refused. They want to “set an example” for other daughters-in-law, showing what happens if they speak out.\n\n**We are desperate for help.** All we want is for my sister to get a divorce and move on with her life.\n\n**Questions We Need Help With:**\n\n1. How can we speed up the court process and make sure her in-laws and husband are held responsible?\n2. What legal steps can we take to secure a divorce and protect her future?\n3. How do we fight the manipulation of the police and courts by her in-laws?\n4. Can stricter action be taken against her husband for marrying another woman without her consent?\n\nPlease help us. My sister deserves a chance to live her life with dignity and hope.",

However, more than a year has passed, and the khata transfer by the seller (small individual builder) has still not been done despite multiple follow-ups. \n\nAugust 2024: The seller told us in writing, \"I had already paid 30K to ARO in BBMP, but he said his boss Regional officer is taking time to sign the document. I met the ARO, and he said he would do the work after coming for inspection and the remaining 3 offices. Also, I have to pay, so he'll give a new pid number, and I agreed.\" - This is a direct quote.\n\nDecember 2024: We followed up with the seller again, and he replied: \"That also is at standstill as the sakala site is crashed from 2 months - no khatas and no e khata is being made.\" \n\nJanuary 2025: We followed up with the seller, and he asked for the sale deed copy so he could submit the Affidavit for Khata Bifurcation to get individual numbers for the offices on the floor on which our office is located. I confirmed with him today if he submitted and paid the fees in total. He said yes.\n\nBecause of this delay, we are unable to sell the office. In such a situation, does the buyer have a right to cancel the purchase although the property has been registered? Also, two companies refused to rent the office because we didn't have a khata.",

One of the second generation hier is educated while the rest are not(let’s call him and his kin A and the rest XYZ). This has caused a lot of issues over the years which I will summarise in points. Please feel free to give any info about individual points as well. \n\n1) So A is the only one in possession of the original will and all other survey papers (at least claims to be) and with his he is always encroaching everyone’s property by stating that XYZ have built houses outside the boundaries. \n\nI figure I can get the survey results through a legal process, but the will and other documents, is there a legal process to request him to share all documents that he claims to be the sources with others?\n\n2) A and XYZ agreed to give the said property to a builder for development purposes in 2001. There was some advance money paid out by the builder and there was no development started by the developer in a long time. Since XYZ had no employment, they took out several more advances throughout the years from the said builder, now 20 years later, there is still no development and even though we’re willing to pay the money back (even with interest) the developer isn’t make any progress. \n\nWhat can we do in this situation? \n\nThis has been going on since I was a kid and now I earn quite well and I want to help my dad using some money I can spend. It’s been really hard to see him struggle with his relatives. Any input or suggestions of legal teams are welcome! Thank you for taking the time to read!  ",

        "selftext": "Hi,   \n  \nI want to know certain things. I have been living in rent in a property managed by The Helloworld Coliving in Mumbai. I am facing a fundamental necessity issue, which is drinking water, for which they were supposed to put up a water purifier on the property. They provide water that the property's caretaker refills from another property, and a 20ltr can be used for five people. I have faced multiple issues, such as   \n1. Refilling the water from my friend's place.   \n2. No water available in the middle of the night  \n3. The caretaker not being available to get water, which I have to purchase from Blinkit  \n  \nI had raised multiple complaints with their support team, but they closed the ticket without providing an update or getting a customer response. Their customer service number is provided on the website. I called multiple times, but no one answered the calls. Sometimes, someone responded, but they lack basic essentialnication and accountability. \n\nThe biggest culprit is the property manager; I am sure he has never visited the property. He does most of his work via phone like a mafia boss. Most of the time, he has made false promises and no accountability. Whenever an issue is raised in a call, he gives vague timelines like \"it will be done\". And the biggest irony is that there is only one property manager for the entire location. The support team mainly contacts the property manager to resolve tickets. IItis like a Ponzi scheme where the issue goes completely unheard. I am paying 30k as rent for one single room; I mean, there is a TV, a F#\\*\\*ING TV in the amenities, which is entirely useless but no Water Purifier. The management should be pretty dumb and lame to come up with this.\n\n  \nNow the reason I am facing eviction is I have already mentioned to the support team on email that I will be withholding my rent payment until my issue is fixed which they don't seem to care about as they closed those support tickets which I have raised saying the issue has been fixed but in ground reality nothing's been done. I am clear that when I signed the agreement Water Purifer was part of the amenities that they were supposed to provide. What should I do in this case?",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI need some legal advice regarding a complicated situation.\n\nBackground: I come from a lower-income family. My mother left me immediately when I was born due to psychiatric issues and has lived with her parents for over 25 years. Dad tried applying for divorce, but with no address, no answer or response, he didn't get the divorce. I grew up with my father’s parents, who passed away in 2018.\n\nAfter 15+ years of waiting, My dad (58) found a live-in partner in 2010 who agreed to live without divorce or marriage initially.. She (40) a divorcee with two kids from her first marriage. She didn't tell anything and all lies about her first husband being drunkard and so on. \nThings went downhill quickly with her living in my home— within 1 month my grandparents started losing things, theft, bad behavior, and targeting on property. Whenever dad is at home she acts like an angel with me and grandparents.\n\nGrandparents kicked her out within 1 month and my dad and she have lived separately since 2012 in a rented home.\n\nI am disabled and 90% deaf, and I live in the house my grandparents built in Bangalore. My dad visits daily to help me out with household chores.\n\nIn 2015, dad discovered she had an affair in her first marriage that led to her divorce. Even with dad she had affairs late night talks and dad once caught a guy in home when she was alone. She just brushed it off saying friends. \n\nIn 2017, she had lung cancer, which she made my dad financially supported for operation and recovery.\n\nIn 2018, she had medical treatment to conceive again and ended up having a child without my dad’s decision as well. We don't even know if the kid belongs to dad. She hid this news until the 6th month.\n\nIn 2021, they had a violent fight, leading to police involvement. She took the child and ran to Kerala. She’s using the child to emotionally blackmail dad and has sent legal notices to my address claiming dowry and demanding to live in my home. Despite her issues, people seem to side with her. She tried to barge into my home and dad tried to push her out, leading to my name being included in an FIR.\n\nNow, in 2025, a similar fight happened in their rental home and police were called again.\n\nShe’s sending more legal notices through lawyers in Kerala and demands my dad appear before the Kerala Vanitha Committee on a date. \nThis notice came through my home address and dad unknowingly signed and took the letter, later he was regretting he should not have taken in my home address. \n\nThe latest issue is that she wants to live in my home, as my dad has no income.\nAnd she wants dad to marry her in order to see the child or to be in peace, else she would work on creating issues. \n\nMy dad has a small 1BHK near Electronic City around agricultural land, but she refuses to live there and insists on coming to my home.\n\nShe is also trying to involve me in all this and I suspect she'll again try to enter my home forcefully to live in.\n\nI’m already struggling with my disability unable to work effectively, lost my future, and finances aspects, and now the added legal fees and headache are difficult to pay. \n\nMy home is still in my grandparents' name, and I need to settle a amount as per will with my dad's sister to own it in my name which i am yet to do. \n\nWhat can I legally do to stop her from sending these notices and pulling me into this mess?\nCan i send a return notice to not disturb me and my dad does not stay here in my home? \n\nI don’t want her to stay in my home. Should I send a response to the lawyer stating my dad doesn’t live with me full-time? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nI’m also worried for my dad, who is 58 and having knee issues and worsening health not sure what kind of trouble will he be in. \nHow can i help my dad here. I know he did msny mistakes. But he supports me and understand my issues and try to help me as much as possible. \n\nI have no one to approach or ask for help, no relatives would come in for help unless there is a death. ",

My flight was to depart Imphal at 9:00AM , they did call and try to tell me that flight is cancelled , but the problem is it was too late.\n\nNow because of this i have been at a loss of close to 18K. I know that i will get a refund but the it was imperative that i had to travel to the aizawl as my returning flight to bengaluru was on the 26th, and i could not miss this.\n\nNow, other than the ticket refund, how can i remake the loss of 18K, i am at the moment broke and in debt to a friend. Is there a way to force the company to payup, all they said was operational difficulties and i have it on record. from my understanding i think they couldn't get a lot of people on the plane to make it worth the cost of service, but that's not my problem.I think this is a unique case as i spoke to some of the staff and they said not many people had any other flights from flying plans from aizawl",

        "selftext": "\n\nI need advice regarding my eligibility for a teaching post and whether I should pursue a court case to claim the position. Here’s my situation:\n\n1. Background:\n\nI applied for a teaching post where the notification mentioned that only candidates with a B.Ed. in Special Education are eligible.\n\nHowever, I knew the qualifications mentioned in the notification were incomplete because, based on past vacancies, candidates with a graduation + special diploma (recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India, RCI) were also eligible.\n\nThe RCI is the only body authorized to decide eligibility criteria for such posts, not the government.\n\n\n\n2. My Qualifications at the Time:\n\nI had a special diploma and was pursuing my graduation. However, my graduation was incomplete at the time of application.\n\nDespite this, I filled out the form, sat for the exam, and scored more than 20 marks above the cutoff (in the 2x result list).\n\n\n\n3. Current Scenario:\n\nI did not attend document verification because I had not completed my graduation by the last date of application, as per the notification’s criteria. , also government was only allowing special bed candidates\n\nMeanwhile, the government sought clarification from the RCI regarding qualifications, and the RCI confirmed that diploma holders (like me) are also valid for the post.\n\nAnd after 6-8 months due to some answers get changed, 2x result was canceled, and a new, fresh result was released today. My roll number is still in this list.\n\n\n\n4. Dilemma:\n\nThe notification clearly stated that all qualifications must be completed by the last date of application, which I did not meet.\n\nHowever, I believe I am eligible for the post based on RCI's clarification and past precedence.\n\nI desperately need this job, and I worked incredibly hard for it.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\nDo I have a strong case if I file a court petition?\n\nWhat legal arguments can I make to strengthen my case?\n\nAre there any past judgments or legal principles that could support my claim?\n\n\nI understand my chances might be slim, but I want to explore all possible options. Your guidance would mean a lot to me.\n\nThank you!\n\n.\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI had placed an order with Zara for 8 items worth 21k in Dec 2024. Unfortunately, all the items had some issue or the other in terms of size and fit so I decided to return it. I raised a request to return the items on 30th Dec and my order was picked up by a Delhivery guy on 31st Dec 2024. The person who picked it up was behaving very strangely. As he went through each item to confirm everything was there with all tags intact, he kept asking me the total value of the order and saying \"Ye order toh kaafi mehenga hoga na madam?\" \nI didn't respond and asked him to verify if it was him who was supposed to pick it up. And he said yes and that it was his first day of work so he is new to all this. I verified his phone number from the Delhivery app and then handed him my entire parcel. I later got an email from Delhivery that day that my order was picked up. \n\nOn 3rd Jan 2025, I received and email from Delhivery that my parcel was returned to Zara warehouse. Usually, when we return items to Zara, we get an email from them confirming that they have received it and the refund will be processed. I kept waiting for that email but didn't get one. I contacted Zara's customer service on 10th Jan 2025 and they told me they had only received one sweater in the parcel and it was a non-Zara item so they will not be giving me a refund. I have been chasing them ever since through calls every other day and their executives keep telling me to wait for 24-48 hours as my case has been expedited. But it's going to be month since I returned all the items. \n\nI have my suspicions that the Delhivery pickup guy stole my parcel and handed them random item. But I have not even been able to reach out to Delhivery since they deactivate their AWBs within 15 days. And their automated customer service says to contact the seller. And Zara has been utterly useless in those terms. \n\nI really need my money back. \n\nIs this worth filing a case in consumer court? How can we do it? Or is there any other way I can get them to give my refund. ",

        "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nThanks in advance for reading this huge wall of text :)\n\nA family member of mine booked a wedding hall/banquet situated in Sec 56 Gurgaon on July 7th 2024. They paid 90000 as a booking amount of the total Rs 3,15,000 (Food and Venue only, no decoration.). \n\nThey had booked the pool side venue, however at the time of booking, the pool was operational for members and functions were not being conducted. The Salesperson told us that we can come in November to look at their poolside functions to finalize our decoration.\n\nFast forward to end of November, we had not heard anything from the sales person, and after following up with her multiple times to give us a time to visit the venue for tasting and to see the decoration, she finally gave us a date of Dec 4th. She had informed us that there would be a wedding function in the eve of 4th Dec where we can see sample decoration and taste the food. \n\nWhen on Dec 4th we reached the venue, it was in an ABYSSMAL condition. It looked like they were taking apart the decoration instead of putting it up. Keep in mind that we went there at 8 pm, and the wedding guests had almost started to arrive. \n\nThe entire venue was covered in used straws and disposable spoons/plates, maybe from the day before function and nobody had bothered cleaning it up. The sofa for the bride and groom was dirty and torn and had food/stains marks all over. The low chairs for the bride and groom during pheras, were dirty, and had holes in them. Without getting into more details, it was a very horrible setup.\n\nNow based on all of this, we decided to confront the sales lady (who had been trying to avoid us the entire time btw), and we told them to cancel the venue. \n\nWe had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. With to and fro with the venue management, we were able to get them to send an email to us stating that they will refund \"the amount that we paid at the time of booking\" and that we can expect the refund in 3rd week of January 2025. \n\nHowever, since passing of 3rd week of Jan 2025, they have stopped responding and keep saying that they will send a final date soon. \n\nTldr: A family member booked a poolside wedding venue in Sec 56, Gurgaon, for July 7, 2024, paying ₹90,000 upfront (total ₹3,15,000). The salesperson promised a visit in November to view decorations and food tasting, but after delays, they finally scheduled it for Dec 4. Upon visiting, the venue was in terrible condition—dirty, torn furniture, and no proper setup despite an ongoing event. The family decided to cancel, however they had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. Upon negotiations, the family got an email confirmation of a refund with the venue management. The venue promised a refund by mid-Jan 2025 but has since stopped responding and delayed giving a final refund date. \n\nWhat legal steps can the family take to recover this amount? \n\n",

It’s going to be little long but he actually needs help so please read\n\nHe met a girl in 2019 they fell in love and started living together later he got to know that she was married but she said they got divorced and he trusted her! Then 6 months into the relationship she was after him to get married within 5-10 days as her mother was sick and there won’t be any auspicious day after 30th of some month i don’t remember. He tried to explain her that marriage doesn’t happen quickly and he doesn’t earn enough to be married and he also want big wedding someday! But she kept forcing him by saying I don’t care about big wedding i want small wedding!\nIt was just after lockdown and they got married in Arya samaj.\n\nAfter 1 year of marriage she started behaving controlling like leave your friends stay home with me all the time! Mind that she was 5-6 years older to him, he didn’t want to leave his friends and wanted to drink occasionally  with his friends but whenever he made plans she threatened him by saying i will jump from the building or i will cut my hand!\n\nBefore this threatening happened, my friend bought a house on his name and made his wife the nominee! But later on he could not take all this and he ran off!\n\nIt’s been 3 years since he has left his own home! She took all the stuff from the house which had some very expensive stuff also! She took property papers too which is in her bank locker! \n\nWhen she didn’t respond to mutual divorce! My friend met a girl and have been living with her and wants to marry her so he decided to talk to an advocate! Now he got to know she was married before but never divorced her first husband! Lawyer told him if my friend wants to marry again he can but he needs to forget about his own house any all the stuff including money in joint account with her!\n\nNow finally his wife filled a complaint saying he tortured her basically 498 or something! And she also included his mother and sister in it when he has been living away from family for past 11 years and she met the family twice only that too for lunch or dinner only!\n\nSo he wants to know that she can take away his home and joint account money? Which is his only asset as his family doesn’t talk to him and have nothing else. And as she is not divorced before so can she still claim everything ?",

I contacted them via email regarding the same and I was shocked by their reply. They said and I quote - \n\n\"I'm sorry to hear about the damage to your product. Unfortunately, according to our policy, we do not provide a warranty if the product is damaged or lost due to improper use. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.\"\n\nIt's not even due to outside damage or misuse which they mention in their warranty terms, it's literally the cheap quality of plastic used in the headband. Also if it's not covered under the warranty claim, then why replace them for customers outside of India? This is a well known defect and they've very much acknowledged it in the past as well, I am positively mystified at this remark.\n\nIs there something I can do legally to get them to honor this warranty claim?

She discovered that massive, decades-old trees on the school campus had been cut down.\n\n\n2. The school headmaster had permission to cut only one dead/dried-out tree and this was done by the concerned authorities by following the procedure few days back\n\n\n3. But yesterday (26/1/25) me and my mom saw that the headmaster has illegally cut two healthy trees without proper authorization (she wasn't present at the sight) and we have a video evidence of the man admitting that the headmaster has payed him to cut.\n\n\n4. The wood from these trees is very valuable and is intended for personal profit.\n\n\n5. As per procedure, tree-felling requires permission from BBMP or the Karnataka Forest Department, who also handle the cutting and removal process. This wasn’t followed.\n\n\n6. My mother recorded videos of the site as evidence and is considering filing a complaint.\n\n\n\nMy Concerns:\n\nIf my mother or I escalate this (e.g., filing a complaint or posting on Twitter), could we face any legal trouble or retaliation from the school/headmaster?\n\nIs there any other legal procedure or body we should approach to address this?\n\n\nKey Questions for Advice:\n\n1. What are the potential legal risks for us if we take this forward?\n\n\n2. What steps should we take to ensure this is handled legally and safely?\n\n\n3. Is there any way to ensure anonymity for my mother while filing the complaint? I'm planning to post this on X(twitter) since benguluru police are active there from what I know ",

I'm happy to learn and discuss. 😊\n\n# Uttarakhand Implements Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in 2024\n\nThe Uttarakhand government has introduced the **Uniform Civil Code (UCC)**, making it the first Indian state to adopt a unified legal framework for all its residents. This law simplifies and regulates matters like **marriage, divorce, inheritance**, and **live-in relationships**, ensuring everyone is treated equally under the same set of laws, regardless of their religion or cultural practices.\n\n# Key Points of the UCC\n\n1. **Marriage Rules:**\n   * Both partners must be **unmarried** at the time of marriage.\n   * Minimum age for marriage: **21 years for men, 18 years for women.**\n   * Marriage between close relatives (prohibited relationships) is not allowed unless permitted by specific customs, and those customs must not go against public policy.\n2. **Polygamy Banned:**\n   * Polygamy is **prohibited for everyone**, including communities where it was previously allowed (e.g., Muslim personal laws).\n   * Only **monogamous marriages** will be legally valid under the UCC.\n3. **Mandatory Marriage Registration:**\n   * Every marriage, even if solemnized outside Uttarakhand, must be registered with the authorities if at least one partner is a resident of the state.\n   * Marriages conducted since **2010** must also be registered retroactively.\n4. **Live-in Relationships:**\n   * Couples in live-in relationships must register their partnership within **30 days** of living together.\n   * **Children born from live-in relationships are considered legitimate** and will have inheritance rights.\n   * Women deserted by live-in partners can claim **financial support (maintenance)** through the courts.\n5. **Equal Inheritance Rights:**\n   * Both sons and daughters are given **equal inheritance rights** to their parents’ property, ensuring gender equality.\n6. **Religious Freedom for Ceremonies:**\n   * Couples can marry following their own religious or customary traditions, such as **Saptapadi, Nikah, Holy Union**, or **Anand Karaj.**\n\n# Who Does It Apply To?\n\n* The UCC applies to **all residents of Uttarakhand**, even those living outside the state.\n* **Scheduled Tribes** and groups with **protected customary practices** under the Constitution are exempt from this Code.\n\n# What Changes Under the UCC?\n\nThe UCC replaces personal laws based on religion with a **common set of rules** for everyone. For example:\n\n* Practices like **polygamy** are no longer allowed.\n* There is now a standardized procedure for marriage, divorce, and property inheritance.\n* Women in both marriages and live-in relationships have clear legal protections.\n\nFINE AND IMPRISONMENT \n\n* Under the Uttarakhand UCC, 2024, failing to submit a live-in relationship statement can result in:\n\nFine: Up to ₹10,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 3 months.\n\nProviding false information or ignoring notices can lead to stricter penalties, including:\n\nFine: Up to ₹25,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 6 months.",

Here’s the situation:\n\n* My father already has a passport, but it expired 5 years ago.\n* He renewed his passport in 2009, and at that time, due to a misunderstanding, his name was recorded incorrectly. Specifically, his grandfather’s name (father's father's name) was included, resulting in a trimmed/abbreviated version of his actual name.\n* Now, his old passport has a name that doesn’t match his Aadhaar card or other documents.\n\nWe recently applied for a passport renewal and visited the Passport Seva Kendra with all the necessary documents for a name correction. However, the officer in charge put the application on hold and insisted that we update the name on his Aadhaar card to match the old passport.\n\nWhile changing the name on the Aadhaar card is possible, it would create a ripple effect, as many other documents (bank accounts, property papers, etc.) are linked to the current name on his Aadhaar. This is the name we prefer to maintain, as it’s consistent across all other documents.\n\nOur goal is to correct the name in the passport to match the Aadhaar card, rather than changing the Aadhaar card to match the old passport. Is there any way to achieve this? Has anyone faced a similar situation or have advice on how to resolve this issue?\n\nAny guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

My mom became physically abusive, and my family started saying awful things to me—things I never imagined they’d say.**\n\n**I feel trapped.

It’s in an unsafe condition, with structural instability, burnt debris, and residual oil spills. Despite this, the previous tenant is trying to resume operations there, posing serious risks to public safety.\n\nHere’s what has happened so far:\n\n1. A grievance was filed with the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office, and the issue was forwarded to the District Joint Director (LSGD) and then to the Panchayat.\n\n1. The Panchayat’s investigation report merely stated that “the building is partially ruined” without addressing concerns like structural instability or chemical hazards. No actions have been taken so far.\n\n1. The grievance was closed by the Joint Director's office without verifying if the Panchayat's response addressed the concerns or if any appropriate action was taken.\n\n1. When approached, the Panchayat, the officials said that the Panchayat isn’t responsible for stopping businesses from operating in unsafe premises, but they didn’t clarify which authority is.\n\nI’m not sure what to do next. I’ve contacted multiple authorities, but no action has been taken so far.\n\nMy questions:\n\n* Which authority is responsible for preventing businesses from operating in unsafe buildings in Kerala?\n\n* Should this be escalated to any higher authority?\n\n* Is there any foul play happening? Is that the reason no authority is taking any action?\n\n* How can I ensure that this matter is taken seriously and that action is initiated?\n\nI will attach photos of the burnt building for reference. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!\n\n ",

Since then, I have not gotten my car back. It’s been almost 9 months, and dealing with Zoomcar has been a nightmare.\n\nAfter repeated attempts to get in touch, their lawyer finally called me and informed me that my car has been impounded by the Bihar police. Apparently, the person who rented my car used it to smuggle a huge quantity of alcohol. Since the smuggler wasn’t caught during the incident, they charged me—the car owner—as an accused.\n\nThe lawyer told me I need to:\n\nGo to Bihar to get bail for my name.\nFile cases in the civil court, DM court, and then the high court to get my car back.\n\nThey also said Zoomcar cannot help me further.\nI hired a lawyer to handle this, but after 9 months, there has been no progress. This situation has taken a massive toll on my mental health. My family, work, and studies are all suffering, and I’m experiencing severe anxiety and depression because of this ordeal.\n\nI feel completely helpless and stuck. Has anyone faced a similar issue or can guide me on what to do next? Are there any legal steps I can take against Zoomcar for their negligence or lack of support?\n\nAny advice or suggestions would mean the world to me. Thank you in advance!\n",

I’ve marked the old wire line with ----. Now, our neighbor also wants to shift the poles to the end of their land along the highway. The last two poles are on our land, forming a straight line perpendicular to the road.\n\nThey are saying it won’t be possible without our cooperation (but I know that even if we don’t shift our pole, which is already on our land away from the highway, the second pole near the highway is in the right place). We can't refuse outright because we live in a village and are expected to cooperate.\n\nThe issue is the total cost. The electricity department has quoted around **₹3.5 lakhs** for the shift. They say we will get an official receipt from the government. Since the poles are on the land of three families (including ours), our share of the cost would be around **₹1.2 lakhs**.\n\nI want to understand the process for this:\n\n1. Can they charge this much?\n2. Is it true that the electricity department installs new poles when shifting old ones?\n\n**Other info:**\n\n* **State**: Uk\n* Why shift - We currently have no problem with the poles being on our land since the area is used for farming. However, some neighbors have built buildings nearby, so they are the ones who want this shift.\n* The poles don’t supply electricity to the village (not sure), but I think they are primarily for factories using high-voltage lines.",

Also another family who moved in 2 years ago and started planting his home garden in the common area has been unhappy with the Neem trees because his plants don't get direct sunlight. \nBoth parties have made multiple attempts to have the trees cut down. Once we even had to fight the family because the resident was literally up on a neem tree and cutting a branch himself. \nTurns out the MCF guys visited today (not sure if this is true), and said they need to cut some branches because they are touching the electricity grid wires. Well, okay. Assuming it is true, fine. \nBUT. \nThey have CLEARLY CUT SO MUCH MORE THAN NECESSARY. TREES THAT DID NOT EVEN HAVE ANY BRANCHES TOUCHING OR NEAR THE WIRES HAVE BEEN CUT DOWN. \nI spoke to the people cutting it down and they said that some was for the MCF work, but the society families have also come and requested them to cut extra without telling anyone. \n\nWhat can I do here? \n\nIt's painful to see. It's so incredibly wrong. 20+ years of strong, beautiful, lush green trees just cut down. These stupid men and women don't realise that these very trees provided shade in summers, which are increasingly unbearable each year. \n\nI want to slap some legal on the society management so that they know things dont go without consequences. Please help in case anyone has an idea. Thanks a lot in advance. ",

        "selftext": "We are a Muslim family from Maharashtra, and I am sharing my sister’s painful story. She was married in 2020 through an arranged marriage. The groom’s family seemed educated but turned out to be extremely controlling and orthodox. From the very first day, my sister faced mental and physical abuse.\n\nHere’s what she went through:\n\n1. **No Freedom from Day One:** On the first day after her wedding, her in-laws took away her phone and sent it back to us. When she asked her husband, he told her that daughters-in-law in their house are not allowed to have phones and she should use his phone instead. To avoid arguments, my sister gave up her phone and her connection to the outside world.\n2. **Total Control Over Her Life:** Her in-laws controlled everything—what she wore, who she talked to, what she ate, even how and when she laughed.\n3. **No Respect in Her Marriage:** Her husband ignored her completely. He spent most of his time with a girl named \"Gudiya,\" who lived with the family but wasn’t related to them. Shockingly, they even shared my sister’s bed while she was forced to sleep on the floor. He avoided talking to her and came home late at night to avoid any confrontation.\n4. **Her Career Dreams Crushed:** My sister is highly qualified (MA in Geography and B.Ed) and wanted to become a professor. Her husband was also a teacher before their marriage, so we thought he would support her dreams. But after marriage, she found out he had quit his job because his mother told him to. When she tried to prepare for exams like NET/SET, her sister-in-law created drama and stopped her from studying.\n5. **No Healthcare or Basic Dignity:** If she fell sick, she was mocked for being weak. They refused to take her to the doctor unless her condition was serious.\n6. **Gold and Dowry Demands:** Her in-laws constantly praised their elder daughter-in-law for bringing dowry and gold every month. They took all the gold my sister brought with her and kept it in a bank without her consent.\n\nShe silently endured this abuse for two years before finally telling us everything. We immediately filed a domestic violence case against her in-laws and husband.\n\n**Legal Struggles**\n\nSince filing the case, her in-laws have avoided every court hearing by manipulating the police and the system. Over a year has passed, and they haven’t attended a single hearing. Meanwhile, my sister has to go to every hearing, reliving her trauma.\n\nEven when a non-bailable warrant was issued, they managed to escape. Their lawyer even got permission for them to skip court appearances. The judge handling the case seems hesitant to take any action, leaving my sister stuck.\n\nTo make things worse, during this time, her husband secretly married another woman without my sister’s consent. While he lives happily, my sister is left to deal with endless legal battles and mental pain.\n\nWe once thought of settling the matter out of court to get her a divorce, but her in-laws refused. They want to “set an example” for other daughters-in-law, showing what happens if they speak out.\n\n**We are desperate for help.** All we want is for my sister to get a divorce and move on with her life.\n\n**Questions We Need Help With:**\n\n1. How can we speed up the court process and make sure her in-laws and husband are held responsible?\n2. What legal steps can we take to secure a divorce and protect her future?\n3. How do we fight the manipulation of the police and courts by her in-laws?\n4. Can stricter action be taken against her husband for marrying another woman without her consent?\n\nPlease help us. My sister deserves a chance to live her life with dignity and hope.",

There was some advance money paid out by the builder and there was no development started by the developer in a long time.

I am facing a fundamental necessity issue, which is drinking water, for which they were supposed to put up a water purifier on the property. They provide water that the property's caretaker refills from another property, and a 20ltr can be used for five people. I have faced multiple issues, such as   \n1. Refilling the water from my friend's place.   \n2. No water available in the middle of the night  \n3. The caretaker not being available to get water, which I have to purchase from Blinkit  \n  \nI had raised multiple complaints with their support team, but they closed the ticket without providing an update or getting a customer response. Their customer service number is provided on the website. I called multiple times, but no one answered the calls. Sometimes, someone responded, but they lack basic essentialnication and accountability. \n\nThe biggest culprit is the property manager; I am sure he has never visited the property. He does most of his work via phone like a mafia boss. Most of the time, he has made false promises and no accountability. Whenever an issue is raised in a call, he gives vague timelines like \"it will be done\". And the biggest irony is that there is only one property manager for the entire location. The support team mainly contacts the property manager to resolve tickets. IItis like a Ponzi scheme where the issue goes completely unheard. I am paying 30k as rent for one single room; I mean, there is a TV, a F#\\*\\*ING TV in the amenities, which is entirely useless but no Water Purifier. The management should be pretty dumb and lame to come up with this.\n\n  \nNow the reason I am facing eviction is I have already mentioned to the support team on email that I will be withholding my rent payment until my issue is fixed which they don't seem to care about as they closed those support tickets which I have raised saying the issue has been fixed but in ground reality nothing's been done. I am clear that when I signed the agreement Water Purifer was part of the amenities that they were supposed to provide. What should I do in this case?",

My mother left me immediately when I was born due to psychiatric issues and has lived with her parents for over 25 years. Dad tried applying for divorce, but with no address, no answer or response, he didn't get the divorce. I grew up with my father’s parents, who passed away in 2018.\n\nAfter 15+ years of waiting, My dad (58) found a live-in partner in 2010 who agreed to live without divorce or marriage initially.. She (40) a divorcee with two kids from her first marriage. She didn't tell anything and all lies about her first husband being drunkard and so on. \nThings went downhill quickly with her living in my home— within 1 month my grandparents started losing things, theft, bad behavior, and targeting on property. Whenever dad is at home she acts like an angel with me and grandparents.\n\nGrandparents kicked her out within 1 month and my dad and she have lived separately since 2012 in a rented home.\n\nI am disabled and 90% deaf, and I live in the house my grandparents built in Bangalore. My dad visits daily to help me out with household chores.\n\nIn 2015, dad discovered she had an affair in her first marriage that led to her divorce. Even with dad she had affairs late night talks and dad once caught a guy in home when she was alone. She just brushed it off saying friends. \n\nIn 2017, she had lung cancer, which she made my dad financially supported for operation and recovery.\n\nIn 2018, she had medical treatment to conceive again and ended up having a child without my dad’s decision as well. We don't even know if the kid belongs to dad. She hid this news until the 6th month.\n\nIn 2021, they had a violent fight, leading to police involvement. She took the child and ran to Kerala. She’s using the child to emotionally blackmail dad and has sent legal notices to my address claiming dowry and demanding to live in my home. Despite her issues, people seem to side with her. She tried to barge into my home and dad tried to push her out, leading to my name being included in an FIR.\n\nNow, in 2025, a similar fight happened in their rental home and police were called again.\n\nShe’s sending more legal notices through lawyers in Kerala and demands my dad appear before the Kerala Vanitha Committee on a date. \nThis notice came through my home address and dad unknowingly signed and took the letter, later he was regretting he should not have taken in my home address. \n\nThe latest issue is that she wants to live in my home, as my dad has no income.\nAnd she wants dad to marry her in order to see the child or to be in peace, else she would work on creating issues. \n\nMy dad has a small 1BHK near Electronic City around agricultural land, but she refuses to live there and insists on coming to my home.\n\nShe is also trying to involve me in all this and I suspect she'll again try to enter my home forcefully to live in.\n\nI’m already struggling with my disability unable to work effectively, lost my future, and finances aspects, and now the added legal fees and headache are difficult to pay. \n\nMy home is still in my grandparents' name, and I need to settle a amount as per will with my dad's sister to own it in my name which i am yet to do. \n\nWhat can I legally do to stop her from sending these notices and pulling me into this mess?\nCan i send a return notice to not disturb me and my dad does not stay here in my home? \n\nI don’t want her to stay in my home. Should I send a response to the lawyer stating my dad doesn’t live with me full-time? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nI’m also worried for my dad, who is 58 and having knee issues and worsening health not sure what kind of trouble will he be in. \nHow can i help my dad here. I know he did msny mistakes. But he supports me and understand my issues and try to help me as much as possible. \n\nI have no one to approach or ask for help, no relatives would come in for help unless there is a death. ",

Some miscreants edited and leaked explicit pics of my sister. They also sent the images to us for blackmail. They messaged us using anonymous Instagram accounts. \n1. We tried to talk them out of it but they didn't respond positively. \n1. Since my sister was stressed, we were looking after her Insta account. \n1. Around the same time, my sister's old friend who had a new Instagram account also messaged her. We didn't know it was a friend. We thought it was one of the miscreants. Some rude messages were exchanged and then that person (friend) stopped. \n1. We filed an FIR against all the 4 anonymous Insta accounts. \n1. The police got their real names from Meta company. \n1. We also managed to get the names of the account owners from the cops. 2 people who had a quarrel with my sister and 1 old friend (that's how we came to know about the friend's new account). \n1. The friend also got a call from the police and then called us to explain. \n\nSo now, we have a situation where we named an friendly innocent person (along with the real culprits)  in the FIR. \n\nHow can we resolve the situation with minimum trouble to our friend? We don't want the friend to go through the pain of the legal process. ",

My flight was to depart Imphal at 9:00AM , they did call and try to tell me that flight is cancelled , but the problem is it was too late.\n\nNow because of this i have been at a loss of close to 18K. I know that i will get a refund but the it was imperative that i had to travel to the aizawl as my returning flight to bengaluru was on the 26th, and i could not miss this.\n\nNow, other than the ticket refund, how can i remake the loss of 18K, i am at the moment broke and in debt to a friend. Is there a way to force the company to payup, all they said was operational difficulties and i have it on record. from my understanding i think they couldn't get a lot of people on the plane to make it worth the cost of service, but that's not my problem.I think this is a unique case as i spoke to some of the staff and they said not many people had any other flights from flying plans from aizawl",

        "selftext": "\n\nI need advice regarding my eligibility for a teaching post and whether I should pursue a court case to claim the position. Here’s my situation:\n\n1. Background:\n\nI applied for a teaching post where the notification mentioned that only candidates with a B.Ed. in Special Education are eligible.\n\nHowever, I knew the qualifications mentioned in the notification were incomplete because, based on past vacancies, candidates with a graduation + special diploma (recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India, RCI) were also eligible.\n\nThe RCI is the only body authorized to decide eligibility criteria for such posts, not the government.\n\n\n\n2. My Qualifications at the Time:\n\nI had a special diploma and was pursuing my graduation. However, my graduation was incomplete at the time of application.\n\nDespite this, I filled out the form, sat for the exam, and scored more than 20 marks above the cutoff (in the 2x result list).\n\n\n\n3. Current Scenario:\n\nI did not attend document verification because I had not completed my graduation by the last date of application, as per the notification’s criteria. , also government was only allowing special bed candidates\n\nMeanwhile, the government sought clarification from the RCI regarding qualifications, and the RCI confirmed that diploma holders (like me) are also valid for the post.\n\nAnd after 6-8 months due to some answers get changed, 2x result was canceled, and a new, fresh result was released today. My roll number is still in this list.\n\n\n\n4. Dilemma:\n\nThe notification clearly stated that all qualifications must be completed by the last date of application, which I did not meet.\n\nHowever, I believe I am eligible for the post based on RCI's clarification and past precedence.\n\nI desperately need this job, and I worked incredibly hard for it.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\nDo I have a strong case if I file a court petition?\n\nWhat legal arguments can I make to strengthen my case?\n\nAre there any past judgments or legal principles that could support my claim?\n\n\nI understand my chances might be slim, but I want to explore all possible options. Your guidance would mean a lot to me.\n\nThank you!\n\n.\n\n",

Unfortunately, all the items had some issue or the other in terms of size and fit so I decided to return it. I raised a request to return the items on 30th Dec and my order was picked up by a Delhivery guy on 31st Dec 2024. The person who picked it up was behaving very strangely. As he went through each item to confirm everything was there with all tags intact, he kept asking me the total value of the order and saying \"Ye order toh kaafi mehenga hoga na madam?\" \nI didn't respond and asked him to verify if it was him who was supposed to pick it up. And he said yes and that it was his first day of work so he is new to all this. I verified his phone number from the Delhivery app and then handed him my entire parcel. I later got an email from Delhivery that day that my order was picked up. \n\nOn 3rd Jan 2025, I received and email from Delhivery that my parcel was returned to Zara warehouse. Usually, when we return items to Zara, we get an email from them confirming that they have received it and the refund will be processed. I kept waiting for that email but didn't get one. I contacted Zara's customer service on 10th Jan 2025 and they told me they had only received one sweater in the parcel and it was a non-Zara item so they will not be giving me a refund. I have been chasing them ever since through calls every other day and their executives keep telling me to wait for 24-48 hours as my case has been expedited. But it's going to be month since I returned all the items. \n\nI have my suspicions that the Delhivery pickup guy stole my parcel and handed them random item. But I have not even been able to reach out to Delhivery since they deactivate their AWBs within 15 days. And their automated customer service says to contact the seller. And Zara has been utterly useless in those terms. \n\nI really need my money back. \n\nIs this worth filing a case in consumer court? How can we do it? Or is there any other way I can get them to give my refund. ",

        "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nThanks in advance for reading this huge wall of text :)\n\nA family member of mine booked a wedding hall/banquet situated in Sec 56 Gurgaon on July 7th 2024. They paid 90000 as a booking amount of the total Rs 3,15,000 (Food and Venue only, no decoration.). \n\nThey had booked the pool side venue, however at the time of booking, the pool was operational for members and functions were not being conducted. The Salesperson told us that we can come in November to look at their poolside functions to finalize our decoration.\n\nFast forward to end of November, we had not heard anything from the sales person, and after following up with her multiple times to give us a time to visit the venue for tasting and to see the decoration, she finally gave us a date of Dec 4th. She had informed us that there would be a wedding function in the eve of 4th Dec where we can see sample decoration and taste the food. \n\nWhen on Dec 4th we reached the venue, it was in an ABYSSMAL condition. It looked like they were taking apart the decoration instead of putting it up. Keep in mind that we went there at 8 pm, and the wedding guests had almost started to arrive. \n\nThe entire venue was covered in used straws and disposable spoons/plates, maybe from the day before function and nobody had bothered cleaning it up. The sofa for the bride and groom was dirty and torn and had food/stains marks all over. The low chairs for the bride and groom during pheras, were dirty, and had holes in them. Without getting into more details, it was a very horrible setup.\n\nNow based on all of this, we decided to confront the sales lady (who had been trying to avoid us the entire time btw), and we told them to cancel the venue. \n\nWe had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. With to and fro with the venue management, we were able to get them to send an email to us stating that they will refund \"the amount that we paid at the time of booking\" and that we can expect the refund in 3rd week of January 2025. \n\nHowever, since passing of 3rd week of Jan 2025, they have stopped responding and keep saying that they will send a final date soon. \n\nTldr: A family member booked a poolside wedding venue in Sec 56, Gurgaon, for July 7, 2024, paying ₹90,000 upfront (total ₹3,15,000). The salesperson promised a visit in November to view decorations and food tasting, but after delays, they finally scheduled it for Dec 4. Upon visiting, the venue was in terrible condition—dirty, torn furniture, and no proper setup despite an ongoing event. The family decided to cancel, however they had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. Upon negotiations, the family got an email confirmation of a refund with the venue management. The venue promised a refund by mid-Jan 2025 but has since stopped responding and delayed giving a final refund date. \n\nWhat legal steps can the family take to recover this amount? \n\n",

It’s going to be little long but he actually needs help so please read\n\nHe met a girl in 2019 they fell in love and started living together later he got to know that she was married but she said they got divorced and he trusted her! Then 6 months into the relationship she was after him to get married within 5-10 days as her mother was sick and there won’t be any auspicious day after 30th of some month i don’t remember. He tried to explain her that marriage doesn’t happen quickly and he doesn’t earn enough to be married and he also want big wedding someday! But she kept forcing him by saying I don’t care about big wedding i want small wedding!\nIt was just after lockdown and they got married in Arya samaj.\n\nAfter 1 year of marriage she started behaving controlling like leave your friends stay home with me all the time! Mind that she was 5-6 years older to him, he didn’t want to leave his friends and wanted to drink occasionally  with his friends but whenever he made plans she threatened him by saying i will jump from the building or i will cut my hand!\n\nBefore this threatening happened, my friend bought a house on his name and made his wife the nominee! But later on he could not take all this and he ran off!\n\nIt’s been 3 years since he has left his own home! She took all the stuff from the house which had some very expensive stuff also! She took property papers too which is in her bank locker! \n\nWhen she didn’t respond to mutual divorce! My friend met a girl and have been living with her and wants to marry her so he decided to talk to an advocate! Now he got to know she was married before but never divorced her first husband! Lawyer told him if my friend wants to marry again he can but he needs to forget about his own house any all the stuff including money in joint account with her!\n\nNow finally his wife filled a complaint saying he tortured her basically 498 or something! And she also included his mother and sister in it when he has been living away from family for past 11 years and she met the family twice only that too for lunch or dinner only!\n\nSo he wants to know that she can take away his home and joint account money? Which is his only asset as his family doesn’t talk to him and have nothing else. And as she is not divorced before so can she still claim everything ?",

Unfortunately, according to our policy, we do not provide a warranty if the product is damaged or lost due to improper use. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.\"\n\nIt's not even due to outside damage or misuse which they mention in their warranty terms, it's literally the cheap quality of plastic used in the headband. Also if it's not covered under the warranty claim, then why replace them for customers outside of India? This is a well known defect and they've very much acknowledged it in the past as well, I am positively mystified at this remark.\n\nIs there something I can do legally to get them to honor this warranty claim?

She discovered that massive, decades-old trees on the school campus had been cut down.\n\n\n2. The school headmaster had permission to cut only one dead/dried-out tree and this was done by the concerned authorities by following the procedure few days back\n\n\n3.

The wood from these trees is very valuable and is intended for personal profit.\n\n\n5.

My mother recorded videos of the site as evidence and is considering filing a complaint.\n\n\n\nMy Concerns:\n\nIf my mother or I escalate this (e.g., filing a complaint or posting on Twitter), could we face any legal trouble or retaliation from the school/headmaster?\n\nIs there any other legal procedure or body we should approach to address this?\n\n\nKey Questions for Advice:\n\n1. What are the potential legal risks for us if we take this forward?\n\n\n2. What steps should we take to ensure this is handled legally and safely?\n\n\n3.

I gave and served my 1 month notice fully(as mentioned in the employement letter) and got the asset clearance form from them after a month and received no communication from their end since then for over 3-4 months, the HR department and the founder has stayed mum even after I served them a legal notice a few weeks back but I still have not received my FNF amount or any communication regarding it.\n\nWhat should be my next step? I have heard things in consumer court take alot of time and at this point mentally and financially I'm spent. There are other employees as well with their FNF not paid yet and no communication as well from the company, is there any way labour court can be reached etc? Kindly suggest ",

The location is Uttar Pradesh (Ghaziabad).\n\nI have a few questions regarding property ownership:\n\t1.\tIf a son and mother are joint owners of a property, and the son suddenly passes away, who becomes the owner of the property? The son is survived by a wife; will the property now be jointly owned by both the mother and the daughter-in-law?\n\n\t2.\tWhen the property was registered, both the son and the mother were listed as joint owners. However, it was mentioned that the registry included a discount due to the woman’s ownership. Does this imply that the registry is in the mother’s name, and that the property will be transferred solely to her?\n\n\t3.\tIf the property is transferred to the mother’s name, does the daughter-in-law have any rights to it?\n\n\t4.\tIf the mother ultimately receives the property, can she transfer it as a gift to her daughter in order to prevent the daughter-in-law from acquiring any rights to it?\n\nLooking forward to any insights!",

        "selftext": "This post is based on my understanding of the **Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill, 2024**. If there are any mistakes or inaccuracies, please let me know in the comments! I'm happy to learn and discuss. 😊\n\n# Uttarakhand Implements Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in 2024\n\nThe Uttarakhand government has introduced the **Uniform Civil Code (UCC)**, making it the first Indian state to adopt a unified legal framework for all its residents. This law simplifies and regulates matters like **marriage, divorce, inheritance**, and **live-in relationships**, ensuring everyone is treated equally under the same set of laws, regardless of their religion or cultural practices.\n\n# Key Points of the UCC\n\n1. **Marriage Rules:**\n   * Both partners must be **unmarried** at the time of marriage.\n   * Minimum age for marriage: **21 years for men, 18 years for women.**\n   * Marriage between close relatives (prohibited relationships) is not allowed unless permitted by specific customs, and those customs must not go against public policy.\n2. **Polygamy Banned:**\n   * Polygamy is **prohibited for everyone**, including communities where it was previously allowed (e.g., Muslim personal laws).\n   * Only **monogamous marriages** will be legally valid under the UCC.\n3. **Mandatory Marriage Registration:**\n   * Every marriage, even if solemnized outside Uttarakhand, must be registered with the authorities if at least one partner is a resident of the state.\n   * Marriages conducted since **2010** must also be registered retroactively.\n4. **Live-in Relationships:**\n   * Couples in live-in relationships must register their partnership within **30 days** of living together.\n   * **Children born from live-in relationships are considered legitimate** and will have inheritance rights.\n   * Women deserted by live-in partners can claim **financial support (maintenance)** through the courts.\n5. **Equal Inheritance Rights:**\n   * Both sons and daughters are given **equal inheritance rights** to their parents’ property, ensuring gender equality.\n6. **Religious Freedom for Ceremonies:**\n   * Couples can marry following their own religious or customary traditions, such as **Saptapadi, Nikah, Holy Union**, or **Anand Karaj.**\n\n# Who Does It Apply To?\n\n* The UCC applies to **all residents of Uttarakhand**, even those living outside the state.\n* **Scheduled Tribes** and groups with **protected customary practices** under the Constitution are exempt from this Code.\n\n# What Changes Under the UCC?\n\nThe UCC replaces personal laws based on religion with a **common set of rules** for everyone. For example:\n\n* Practices like **polygamy** are no longer allowed.\n* There is now a standardized procedure for marriage, divorce, and property inheritance.\n* Women in both marriages and live-in relationships have clear legal protections.\n\nFINE AND IMPRISONMENT \n\n* Under the Uttarakhand UCC, 2024, failing to submit a live-in relationship statement can result in:\n\nFine: Up to ₹10,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 3 months.\n\nProviding false information or ignoring notices can lead to stricter penalties, including:\n\nFine: Up to ₹25,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 6 months.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI need assistance with a passport issue for my father. The problem is related to a name correction in his passport application. Here’s the situation:\n\n* My father already has a passport, but it expired 5 years ago.\n* He renewed his passport in 2009, and at that time, due to a misunderstanding, his name was recorded incorrectly. Specifically, his grandfather’s name (father's father's name) was included, resulting in a trimmed/abbreviated version of his actual name.\n* Now, his old passport has a name that doesn’t match his Aadhaar card or other documents.\n\nWe recently applied for a passport renewal and visited the Passport Seva Kendra with all the necessary documents for a name correction. However, the officer in charge put the application on hold and insisted that we update the name on his Aadhaar card to match the old passport.\n\nWhile changing the name on the Aadhaar card is possible, it would create a ripple effect, as many other documents (bank accounts, property papers, etc.) are linked to the current name on his Aadhaar. This is the name we prefer to maintain, as it’s consistent across all other documents.\n\nOur goal is to correct the name in the passport to match the Aadhaar card, rather than changing the Aadhaar card to match the old passport. Is there any way to achieve this? Has anyone faced a similar situation or have advice on how to resolve this issue?\n\nAny guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI need help understanding what to do in this situation.\n\nThere was a building located on in Kattakada, Thiruvananthapuram, that was severely damaged in a fire in May 2024. It’s in an unsafe condition, with structural instability, burnt debris, and residual oil spills. Despite this, the previous tenant is trying to resume operations there, posing serious risks to public safety.\n\nHere’s what has happened so far:\n\n1. A grievance was filed with the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office, and the issue was forwarded to the District Joint Director (LSGD) and then to the Panchayat.\n\n1. The Panchayat’s investigation report merely stated that “the building is partially ruined” without addressing concerns like structural instability or chemical hazards. No actions have been taken so far.\n\n1. The grievance was closed by the Joint Director's office without verifying if the Panchayat's response addressed the concerns or if any appropriate action was taken.\n\n1. When approached, the Panchayat, the officials said that the Panchayat isn’t responsible for stopping businesses from operating in unsafe premises, but they didn’t clarify which authority is.\n\nI’m not sure what to do next. I’ve contacted multiple authorities, but no action has been taken so far.\n\nMy questions:\n\n* Which authority is responsible for preventing businesses from operating in unsafe buildings in Kerala?\n\n* Should this be escalated to any higher authority?\n\n* Is there any foul play happening? Is that the reason no authority is taking any action?\n\n* How can I ensure that this matter is taken seriously and that action is initiated?\n\nI will attach photos of the burnt building for reference. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!\n\n ",

Since the smuggler wasn’t caught during the incident, they charged me—the car owner—as an accused.\n\nThe lawyer told me I need to:\n\nGo to Bihar to get bail for my name.\nFile cases in the civil court, DM court, and then the high court to get my car back.\n\nThey also said Zoomcar cannot help me further.\nI hired a lawyer to handle this, but after 9 months, there has been no progress.

My family, work, and studies are all suffering, and I’m experiencing severe anxiety and depression because of this ordeal.\n\nI feel completely helpless and stuck.

I’ve marked the old wire line with ----. Now, our neighbor also wants to shift the poles to the end of their land along the highway. The last two poles are on our land, forming a straight line perpendicular to the road.\n\nThey are saying it won’t be possible without our cooperation (but I know that even if we don’t shift our pole, which is already on our land away from the highway, the second pole near the highway is in the right place). We can't refuse outright because we live in a village and are expected to cooperate.\n\nThe issue is the total cost. The electricity department has quoted around **₹3.5 lakhs** for the shift. They say we will get an official receipt from the government. Since the poles are on the land of three families (including ours), our share of the cost would be around **₹1.2 lakhs**.\n\nI want to understand the process for this:\n\n1. Can they charge this much?\n2. Is it true that the electricity department installs new poles when shifting old ones?\n\n**Other info:**\n\n* **State**: Uk\n* Why shift - We currently have no problem with the poles being on our land since the area is used for farming. However, some neighbors have built buildings nearby, so they are the ones who want this shift.\n* The poles don’t supply electricity to the village (not sure), but I think they are primarily for factories using high-voltage lines.",

Well, okay. Assuming it is true, fine. \nBUT. \nThey have CLEARLY CUT SO MUCH MORE THAN NECESSARY. TREES THAT DID NOT EVEN HAVE ANY BRANCHES TOUCHING OR NEAR THE WIRES HAVE BEEN CUT DOWN. \nI spoke to the people cutting it down and they said that some was for the MCF work, but the society families have also come and requested them to cut extra without telling anyone. \n\nWhat can I do here? \n\nIt's painful to see. It's so incredibly wrong. 20+ years of strong, beautiful, lush green trees just cut down. These stupid men and women don't realise that these very trees provided shade in summers, which are increasingly unbearable each year. \n\nI want to slap some legal on the society management so that they know things dont go without consequences.

        "selftext": "We are a Muslim family from Maharashtra, and I am sharing my sister’s painful story. She was married in 2020 through an arranged marriage. The groom’s family seemed educated but turned out to be extremely controlling and orthodox. From the very first day, my sister faced mental and physical abuse.\n\nHere’s what she went through:\n\n1. **No Freedom from Day One:** On the first day after her wedding, her in-laws took away her phone and sent it back to us. When she asked her husband, he told her that daughters-in-law in their house are not allowed to have phones and she should use his phone instead. To avoid arguments, my sister gave up her phone and her connection to the outside world.\n2. **Total Control Over Her Life:** Her in-laws controlled everything—what she wore, who she talked to, what she ate, even how and when she laughed.\n3. **No Respect in Her Marriage:** Her husband ignored her completely. He spent most of his time with a girl named \"Gudiya,\" who lived with the family but wasn’t related to them. Shockingly, they even shared my sister’s bed while she was forced to sleep on the floor. He avoided talking to her and came home late at night to avoid any confrontation.\n4. **Her Career Dreams Crushed:** My sister is highly qualified (MA in Geography and B.Ed) and wanted to become a professor. Her husband was also a teacher before their marriage, so we thought he would support her dreams. But after marriage, she found out he had quit his job because his mother told him to. When she tried to prepare for exams like NET/SET, her sister-in-law created drama and stopped her from studying.\n5. **No Healthcare or Basic Dignity:** If she fell sick, she was mocked for being weak. They refused to take her to the doctor unless her condition was serious.\n6. **Gold and Dowry Demands:** Her in-laws constantly praised their elder daughter-in-law for bringing dowry and gold every month. They took all the gold my sister brought with her and kept it in a bank without her consent.\n\nShe silently endured this abuse for two years before finally telling us everything. We immediately filed a domestic violence case against her in-laws and husband.\n\n**Legal Struggles**\n\nSince filing the case, her in-laws have avoided every court hearing by manipulating the police and the system. Over a year has passed, and they haven’t attended a single hearing. Meanwhile, my sister has to go to every hearing, reliving her trauma.\n\nEven when a non-bailable warrant was issued, they managed to escape. Their lawyer even got permission for them to skip court appearances. The judge handling the case seems hesitant to take any action, leaving my sister stuck.\n\nTo make things worse, during this time, her husband secretly married another woman without my sister’s consent. While he lives happily, my sister is left to deal with endless legal battles and mental pain.\n\nWe once thought of settling the matter out of court to get her a divorce, but her in-laws refused. They want to “set an example” for other daughters-in-law, showing what happens if they speak out.\n\n**We are desperate for help.** All we want is for my sister to get a divorce and move on with her life.\n\n**Questions We Need Help With:**\n\n1. How can we speed up the court process and make sure her in-laws and husband are held responsible?\n2. What legal steps can we take to secure a divorce and protect her future?\n3. How do we fight the manipulation of the police and courts by her in-laws?\n4. Can stricter action be taken against her husband for marrying another woman without her consent?\n\nPlease help us. My sister deserves a chance to live her life with dignity and hope.",

I can't imagine this ending in any way other than divorce. Whether it's next week or 5 years from now, it will happen.\n\nQuestion: How do I keep myself prepared. I know I can contact a divorce lawyer, but what about other things like removing her as the beneficiary from my investments, how do I handle my daughter's schooling, what about all the documents where she is mentioned as my wife. Would a divorce lawyer help me with these?\n\nIn case it matters, we are Muslims. No official marriage certificate but there's a nikahnama and her name is on my passport.",

One of the second generation hier is educated while the rest are not(let’s call him and his kin A and the rest XYZ). This has caused a lot of issues over the years which I will summarise in points. Please feel free to give any info about individual points as well. \n\n1) So A is the only one in possession of the original will and all other survey papers (at least claims to be) and with his he is always encroaching everyone’s property by stating that XYZ have built houses outside the boundaries. \n\nI figure I can get the survey results through a legal process, but the will and other documents, is there a legal process to request him to share all documents that he claims to be the sources with others?\n\n2) A and XYZ agreed to give the said property to a builder for development purposes in 2001. There was some advance money paid out by the builder and there was no development started by the developer in a long time. Since XYZ had no employment, they took out several more advances throughout the years from the said builder, now 20 years later, there is still no development and even though we’re willing to pay the money back (even with interest) the developer isn’t make any progress. \n\nWhat can we do in this situation? \n\nThis has been going on since I was a kid and now I earn quite well and I want to help my dad using some money I can spend. It’s been really hard to see him struggle with his relatives. Any input or suggestions of legal teams are welcome! Thank you for taking the time to read!  ",

        "selftext": "Hi,   \n  \nI want to know certain things. I have been living in rent in a property managed by The Helloworld Coliving in Mumbai. I am facing a fundamental necessity issue, which is drinking water, for which they were supposed to put up a water purifier on the property. They provide water that the property's caretaker refills from another property, and a 20ltr can be used for five people. I have faced multiple issues, such as   \n1. Refilling the water from my friend's place.   \n2. No water available in the middle of the night  \n3. The caretaker not being available to get water, which I have to purchase from Blinkit  \n  \nI had raised multiple complaints with their support team, but they closed the ticket without providing an update or getting a customer response. Their customer service number is provided on the website. I called multiple times, but no one answered the calls. Sometimes, someone responded, but they lack basic essentialnication and accountability. \n\nThe biggest culprit is the property manager; I am sure he has never visited the property. He does most of his work via phone like a mafia boss. Most of the time, he has made false promises and no accountability. Whenever an issue is raised in a call, he gives vague timelines like \"it will be done\". And the biggest irony is that there is only one property manager for the entire location. The support team mainly contacts the property manager to resolve tickets. IItis like a Ponzi scheme where the issue goes completely unheard. I am paying 30k as rent for one single room; I mean, there is a TV, a F#\\*\\*ING TV in the amenities, which is entirely useless but no Water Purifier. The management should be pretty dumb and lame to come up with this.\n\n  \nNow the reason I am facing eviction is I have already mentioned to the support team on email that I will be withholding my rent payment until my issue is fixed which they don't seem to care about as they closed those support tickets which I have raised saying the issue has been fixed but in ground reality nothing's been done. I am clear that when I signed the agreement Water Purifer was part of the amenities that they were supposed to provide. What should I do in this case?",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI need some legal advice regarding a complicated situation.\n\nBackground: I come from a lower-income family. My mother left me immediately when I was born due to psychiatric issues and has lived with her parents for over 25 years. Dad tried applying for divorce, but with no address, no answer or response, he didn't get the divorce. I grew up with my father’s parents, who passed away in 2018.\n\nAfter 15+ years of waiting, My dad (58) found a live-in partner in 2010 who agreed to live without divorce or marriage initially.. She (40) a divorcee with two kids from her first marriage. She didn't tell anything and all lies about her first husband being drunkard and so on. \nThings went downhill quickly with her living in my home— within 1 month my grandparents started losing things, theft, bad behavior, and targeting on property. Whenever dad is at home she acts like an angel with me and grandparents.\n\nGrandparents kicked her out within 1 month and my dad and she have lived separately since 2012 in a rented home.\n\nI am disabled and 90% deaf, and I live in the house my grandparents built in Bangalore. My dad visits daily to help me out with household chores.\n\nIn 2015, dad discovered she had an affair in her first marriage that led to her divorce. Even with dad she had affairs late night talks and dad once caught a guy in home when she was alone. She just brushed it off saying friends. \n\nIn 2017, she had lung cancer, which she made my dad financially supported for operation and recovery.\n\nIn 2018, she had medical treatment to conceive again and ended up having a child without my dad’s decision as well. We don't even know if the kid belongs to dad. She hid this news until the 6th month.\n\nIn 2021, they had a violent fight, leading to police involvement. She took the child and ran to Kerala. She’s using the child to emotionally blackmail dad and has sent legal notices to my address claiming dowry and demanding to live in my home. Despite her issues, people seem to side with her. She tried to barge into my home and dad tried to push her out, leading to my name being included in an FIR.\n\nNow, in 2025, a similar fight happened in their rental home and police were called again.\n\nShe’s sending more legal notices through lawyers in Kerala and demands my dad appear before the Kerala Vanitha Committee on a date. \nThis notice came through my home address and dad unknowingly signed and took the letter, later he was regretting he should not have taken in my home address. \n\nThe latest issue is that she wants to live in my home, as my dad has no income.\nAnd she wants dad to marry her in order to see the child or to be in peace, else she would work on creating issues. \n\nMy dad has a small 1BHK near Electronic City around agricultural land, but she refuses to live there and insists on coming to my home.\n\nShe is also trying to involve me in all this and I suspect she'll again try to enter my home forcefully to live in.\n\nI’m already struggling with my disability unable to work effectively, lost my future, and finances aspects, and now the added legal fees and headache are difficult to pay. \n\nMy home is still in my grandparents' name, and I need to settle a amount as per will with my dad's sister to own it in my name which i am yet to do. \n\nWhat can I legally do to stop her from sending these notices and pulling me into this mess?\nCan i send a return notice to not disturb me and my dad does not stay here in my home? \n\nI don’t want her to stay in my home. Should I send a response to the lawyer stating my dad doesn’t live with me full-time? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nI’m also worried for my dad, who is 58 and having knee issues and worsening health not sure what kind of trouble will he be in. \nHow can i help my dad here. I know he did msny mistakes. But he supports me and understand my issues and try to help me as much as possible. \n\nI have no one to approach or ask for help, no relatives would come in for help unless there is a death. ",

Around the same time, my sister's old friend who had a new Instagram account also messaged her. We didn't know it was a friend. We thought it was one of the miscreants. Some rude messages were exchanged and then that person (friend) stopped. \n1. We filed an FIR against all the 4 anonymous Insta accounts. \n1. The police got their real names from Meta company. \n1. We also managed to get the names of the account owners from the cops. 2 people who had a quarrel with my sister and 1 old friend (that's how we came to know about the friend's new account). \n1.

Background:\n\nI applied for a teaching post where the notification mentioned that only candidates with a B.Ed. in Special Education are eligible.\n\nHowever, I knew the qualifications mentioned in the notification were incomplete because, based on past vacancies, candidates with a graduation + special diploma (recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India, RCI) were also eligible.\n\nThe RCI is the only body authorized to decide eligibility criteria for such posts, not the government.\n\n\n\n2.

And he said yes and that it was his first day of work so he is new to all this. I verified his phone number from the Delhivery app and then handed him my entire parcel. I later got an email from Delhivery that day that my order was picked up. \n\nOn 3rd Jan 2025, I received and email from Delhivery that my parcel was returned to Zara warehouse. Usually, when we return items to Zara, we get an email from them confirming that they have received it and the refund will be processed. I kept waiting for that email but didn't get one. I contacted Zara's customer service on 10th Jan 2025 and they told me they had only received one sweater in the parcel and it was a non-Zara item so they will not be giving me a refund. I have been chasing them ever since through calls every other day and their executives keep telling me to wait for 24-48 hours as my case has been expedited. But it's going to be month since I returned all the items. \n\nI have my suspicions that the Delhivery pickup guy stole my parcel and handed them random item. But I have not even been able to reach out to Delhivery since they deactivate their AWBs within 15 days. And their automated customer service says to contact the seller. And Zara has been utterly useless in those terms. \n\nI really need my money back. \n\nIs this worth filing a case in consumer court? How can we do it? Or is there any other way I can get them to give my refund. ",

They paid 90000 as a booking amount of the total Rs 3,15,000 (Food and Venue only, no decoration.). \n\nThey had booked the pool side venue, however at the time of booking, the pool was operational for members and functions were not being conducted. The Salesperson told us that we can come in November to look at their poolside functions to finalize our decoration.\n\nFast forward to end of November, we had not heard anything from the sales person, and after following up with her multiple times to give us a time to visit the venue for tasting and to see the decoration, she finally gave us a date of Dec 4th. She had informed us that there would be a wedding function in the eve of 4th Dec where we can see sample decoration and taste the food. \n\nWhen on Dec 4th we reached the venue, it was in an ABYSSMAL condition. It looked like they were taking apart the decoration instead of putting it up. Keep in mind that we went there at 8 pm, and the wedding guests had almost started to arrive. \n\nThe entire venue was covered in used straws and disposable spoons/plates, maybe from the day before function and nobody had bothered cleaning it up. The sofa for the bride and groom was dirty and torn and had food/stains marks all over. The low chairs for the bride and groom during pheras, were dirty, and had holes in them. Without getting into more details, it was a very horrible setup.\n\nNow based on all of this, we decided to confront the sales lady (who had been trying to avoid us the entire time btw), and we told them to cancel the venue. \n\nWe had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. With to and fro with the venue management, we were able to get them to send an email to us stating that they will refund \"the amount that we paid at the time of booking\" and that we can expect the refund in 3rd week of January 2025. \n\nHowever, since passing of 3rd week of Jan 2025, they have stopped responding and keep saying that they will send a final date soon. \n\nTldr: A family member booked a poolside wedding venue in Sec 56, Gurgaon, for July 7, 2024, paying ₹90,000 upfront (total ₹3,15,000). The salesperson promised a visit in November to view decorations and food tasting, but after delays, they finally scheduled it for Dec 4. Upon visiting, the venue was in terrible condition—dirty, torn furniture, and no proper setup despite an ongoing event. The family decided to cancel, however they had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. Upon negotiations, the family got an email confirmation of a refund with the venue management. The venue promised a refund by mid-Jan 2025 but has since stopped responding and delayed giving a final refund date. \n\nWhat legal steps can the family take to recover this amount? \n\n",

        "selftext": "Married woman, married another man without divorce \n\nHi, this happened to my friend as he is not on reddit i decided to post on his behalf for some information. It’s going to be little long but he actually needs help so please read\n\nHe met a girl in 2019 they fell in love and started living together later he got to know that she was married but she said they got divorced and he trusted her! Then 6 months into the relationship she was after him to get married within 5-10 days as her mother was sick and there won’t be any auspicious day after 30th of some month i don’t remember. He tried to explain her that marriage doesn’t happen quickly and he doesn’t earn enough to be married and he also want big wedding someday! But she kept forcing him by saying I don’t care about big wedding i want small wedding!\nIt was just after lockdown and they got married in Arya samaj.\n\nAfter 1 year of marriage she started behaving controlling like leave your friends stay home with me all the time! Mind that she was 5-6 years older to him, he didn’t want to leave his friends and wanted to drink occasionally  with his friends but whenever he made plans she threatened him by saying i will jump from the building or i will cut my hand!\n\nBefore this threatening happened, my friend bought a house on his name and made his wife the nominee! But later on he could not take all this and he ran off!\n\nIt’s been 3 years since he has left his own home! She took all the stuff from the house which had some very expensive stuff also! She took property papers too which is in her bank locker! \n\nWhen she didn’t respond to mutual divorce! My friend met a girl and have been living with her and wants to marry her so he decided to talk to an advocate! Now he got to know she was married before but never divorced her first husband! Lawyer told him if my friend wants to marry again he can but he needs to forget about his own house any all the stuff including money in joint account with her!\n\nNow finally his wife filled a complaint saying he tortured her basically 498 or something! And she also included his mother and sister in it when he has been living away from family for past 11 years and she met the family twice only that too for lunch or dinner only!\n\nSo he wants to know that she can take away his home and joint account money? Which is his only asset as his family doesn’t talk to him and have nothing else. And as she is not divorced before so can she still claim everything ?",

I looked it up and it seems like it's a relatively common QC issue in this particular model. There's plenty of proof here - [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/wx2opz/the_headband_on_my_q30_headphones_broke_after_a/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/lhcei6/soundcore_q30_design_flaw_the_plastic_clips_next/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/xlvwjj/another_broken_soundcore_q30/) [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/187blhc/soundcore_q30_part_broke/) [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/nv4jhk/my_soundcore_q30_broke_always_felt_right_side_was/)\n\nI contacted Anker regarding the 18 Month Warranty claim since a good few people got a new pair after the brittle plastic headband broke the same way, or at least that's what they claimed on their respective reddit threads. I contacted them via email regarding the same and I was shocked by their reply. They said and I quote - \n\n\"I'm sorry to hear about the damage to your product. Unfortunately, according to our policy, we do not provide a warranty if the product is damaged or lost due to improper use. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.\"\n\nIt's not even due to outside damage or misuse which they mention in their warranty terms, it's literally the cheap quality of plastic used in the headband. Also if it's not covered under the warranty claim, then why replace them for customers outside of India? This is a well known defect and they've very much acknowledged it in the past as well, I am positively mystified at this remark.\n\nIs there something I can do legally to get them to honor this warranty claim? Seems like they've shut down my ticket too.",

She discovered that massive, decades-old trees on the school campus had been cut down.\n\n\n2. The school headmaster had permission to cut only one dead/dried-out tree and this was done by the concerned authorities by following the procedure few days back\n\n\n3.

The wood from these trees is very valuable and is intended for personal profit.\n\n\n5.

The son is survived by a wife; will the property now be jointly owned by both the mother and the daughter-in-law?\n\n\t2.\tWhen the property was registered, both the son and the mother were listed as joint owners. However, it was mentioned that the registry included a discount due to the woman’s ownership. Does this imply that the registry is in the mother’s name, and that the property will be transferred solely to her?\n\n\t3.\tIf the property is transferred to the mother’s name, does the daughter-in-law have any rights to it?\n\n\t4.\tIf the mother ultimately receives the property, can she transfer it as a gift to her daughter in order to prevent the daughter-in-law from acquiring any rights to it?\n\nLooking forward to any insights!",

        "selftext": "I have been renting an apartment in Mumbai since December 2022. I initially signed up for one year, then renewed it twice for one year each (December 2023 and December 2024). So the latest agreement is over a month old.\n\nHowever, the landlord in question has not been paying the society maintenance charges for a year now. In addition, a couple of days ago, I also received a Property Tax Demand (Rs. 16K or so) from the BMC meaning he hasn't been paying that either. I have been forwarding these to him over WhatsApp.\n\nThe society office is on my side, and are asking me not to pay the rent for the next month (I planned to pay it as per schedule on Feb 5). They say this will put adequate pressure on him to turn up and clear their bill. Should I proceed with not paying?\n\nAlso, I don't want to deal with this headache anyway - can I just take the hit on my security deposit and walk away, no questions asked? The security deposit is worth approx 3 months of rent. The agreement has a clause saying there is a lock-in period of 6 months, but it also states in another part that the landlord is responsible for paying all the bills. \n\nWhat should I do?",

They rammed into my car and got heavily injured themselves and there was a lot of damage caused to my car as well. I called the police and went to the police station , filed the report and did all the necessary things. \n\nNow the issue is , the other party doesn’t wanna take the issue to the court , infact , they haven’t even contacted the police even once. Now my car is stuck in the police station. I got in contact with a lawyer and he said he’s gonna get a court order and get my car released but he’s demanding 20k for this procedure. \n\nWhat can I do in this scenario?

        "selftext": "This post is based on my understanding of the **Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill, 2024**. If there are any mistakes or inaccuracies, please let me know in the comments! I'm happy to learn and discuss. 😊\n\n# Uttarakhand Implements Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in 2024\n\nThe Uttarakhand government has introduced the **Uniform Civil Code (UCC)**, making it the first Indian state to adopt a unified legal framework for all its residents. This law simplifies and regulates matters like **marriage, divorce, inheritance**, and **live-in relationships**, ensuring everyone is treated equally under the same set of laws, regardless of their religion or cultural practices.\n\n# Key Points of the UCC\n\n1. **Marriage Rules:**\n   * Both partners must be **unmarried** at the time of marriage.\n   * Minimum age for marriage: **21 years for men, 18 years for women.**\n   * Marriage between close relatives (prohibited relationships) is not allowed unless permitted by specific customs, and those customs must not go against public policy.\n2. **Polygamy Banned:**\n   * Polygamy is **prohibited for everyone**, including communities where it was previously allowed (e.g., Muslim personal laws).\n   * Only **monogamous marriages** will be legally valid under the UCC.\n3. **Mandatory Marriage Registration:**\n   * Every marriage, even if solemnized outside Uttarakhand, must be registered with the authorities if at least one partner is a resident of the state.\n   * Marriages conducted since **2010** must also be registered retroactively.\n4. **Live-in Relationships:**\n   * Couples in live-in relationships must register their partnership within **30 days** of living together.\n   * **Children born from live-in relationships are considered legitimate** and will have inheritance rights.\n   * Women deserted by live-in partners can claim **financial support (maintenance)** through the courts.\n5. **Equal Inheritance Rights:**\n   * Both sons and daughters are given **equal inheritance rights** to their parents’ property, ensuring gender equality.\n6. **Religious Freedom for Ceremonies:**\n   * Couples can marry following their own religious or customary traditions, such as **Saptapadi, Nikah, Holy Union**, or **Anand Karaj.**\n\n# Who Does It Apply To?\n\n* The UCC applies to **all residents of Uttarakhand**, even those living outside the state.\n* **Scheduled Tribes** and groups with **protected customary practices** under the Constitution are exempt from this Code.\n\n# What Changes Under the UCC?\n\nThe UCC replaces personal laws based on religion with a **common set of rules** for everyone. For example:\n\n* Practices like **polygamy** are no longer allowed.\n* There is now a standardized procedure for marriage, divorce, and property inheritance.\n* Women in both marriages and live-in relationships have clear legal protections.\n\nFINE AND IMPRISONMENT \n\n* Under the Uttarakhand UCC, 2024, failing to submit a live-in relationship statement can result in:\n\nFine: Up to ₹10,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 3 months.\n\nProviding false information or ignoring notices can lead to stricter penalties, including:\n\nFine: Up to ₹25,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 6 months.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI need assistance with a passport issue for my father. The problem is related to a name correction in his passport application. Here’s the situation:\n\n* My father already has a passport, but it expired 5 years ago.\n* He renewed his passport in 2009, and at that time, due to a misunderstanding, his name was recorded incorrectly. Specifically, his grandfather’s name (father's father's name) was included, resulting in a trimmed/abbreviated version of his actual name.\n* Now, his old passport has a name that doesn’t match his Aadhaar card or other documents.\n\nWe recently applied for a passport renewal and visited the Passport Seva Kendra with all the necessary documents for a name correction. However, the officer in charge put the application on hold and insisted that we update the name on his Aadhaar card to match the old passport.\n\nWhile changing the name on the Aadhaar card is possible, it would create a ripple effect, as many other documents (bank accounts, property papers, etc.) are linked to the current name on his Aadhaar. This is the name we prefer to maintain, as it’s consistent across all other documents.\n\nOur goal is to correct the name in the passport to match the Aadhaar card, rather than changing the Aadhaar card to match the old passport. Is there any way to achieve this? Has anyone faced a similar situation or have advice on how to resolve this issue?\n\nAny guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\n",

I started developing feelings for him, and I wanted to keep him as a friend, so I could have him in my life. We began talking on WhatsApp, but I kept it hidden from my husband and family. Eventually, I introduced him to my husband and family, but they didn’t like him. However, he didn’t say anything about it at first.**\n\n**When my husband found out I’d been hiding messages, he got extremely angry and started getting violent with me. He says he loves me a lot and is possessive, telling me I shouldn’t talk to anyone else. I tried to fight back, saying I want to continue talking to this person, but then my husband told my family about everything, and things got worse. My mom became physically abusive, and my family started saying awful things to me—things I never imagined they’d say.**\n\n**I feel trapped. My family is now threatening to hurt both me and the person I want to stay in touch with if I leave or continue talking to him. I’m staying with my husband for the sake of my kids, even though I feel completely helpless. The person I wanted to talk to is no longer speaking to me, and my family completely hates both me and him now.**\n\n**I’m terrified to even reach out to him, as my husband is tracking my phone and messages and has been threatening me. I honestly don’t know what to do. All are ignoring me and not letting me leave as well. I feel stuck, scared, and like I have no way out. Does anyone have advice on how to navigate this?**",

It’s in an unsafe condition, with structural instability, burnt debris, and residual oil spills. Despite this, the previous tenant is trying to resume operations there, posing serious risks to public safety.\n\nHere’s what has happened so far:\n\n1. A grievance was filed with the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office, and the issue was forwarded to the District Joint Director (LSGD) and then to the Panchayat.\n\n1. The Panchayat’s investigation report merely stated that “the building is partially ruined” without addressing concerns like structural instability or chemical hazards. No actions have been taken so far.\n\n1. The grievance was closed by the Joint Director's office without verifying if the Panchayat's response addressed the concerns or if any appropriate action was taken.\n\n1. When approached, the Panchayat, the officials said that the Panchayat isn’t responsible for stopping businesses from operating in unsafe premises, but they didn’t clarify which authority is.\n\nI’m not sure what to do next. I’ve contacted multiple authorities, but no action has been taken so far.\n\nMy questions:\n\n* Which authority is responsible for preventing businesses from operating in unsafe buildings in Kerala?\n\n* Should this be escalated to any higher authority?\n\n* Is there any foul play happening? Is that the reason no authority is taking any action?\n\n* How can I ensure that this matter is taken seriously and that action is initiated?\n\nI will attach photos of the burnt building for reference. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!\n\n ",

Apparently, the person who rented my car used it to smuggle a huge quantity of alcohol. Since the smuggler wasn’t caught during the incident, they charged me—the car owner—as an accused.\n\nThe lawyer told me I need to:\n\nGo to Bihar to get bail for my name.\nFile cases in the civil court, DM court, and then the high court to get my car back.\n\nThey also said Zoomcar cannot help me further.\nI hired a lawyer to handle this, but after 9 months, there has been no progress. This situation has taken a massive toll on my mental health. My family, work, and studies are all suffering, and I’m experiencing severe anxiety and depression because of this ordeal.\n\nI feel completely helpless and stuck.

I’ve marked the old wire line with ----. Now, our neighbor also wants to shift the poles to the end of their land along the highway. The last two poles are on our land, forming a straight line perpendicular to the road.\n\nThey are saying it won’t be possible without our cooperation (but I know that even if we don’t shift our pole, which is already on our land away from the highway, the second pole near the highway is in the right place). We can't refuse outright because we live in a village and are expected to cooperate.\n\nThe issue is the total cost. The electricity department has quoted around **₹3.5 lakhs** for the shift. They say we will get an official receipt from the government. Since the poles are on the land of three families (including ours), our share of the cost would be around **₹1.2 lakhs**.\n\nI want to understand the process for this:\n\n1. Can they charge this much?\n2. Is it true that the electricity department installs new poles when shifting old ones?\n\n**Other info:**\n\n* **State**: Uk\n* Why shift - We currently have no problem with the poles being on our land since the area is used for farming. However, some neighbors have built buildings nearby, so they are the ones who want this shift.\n* The poles don’t supply electricity to the village (not sure), but I think they are primarily for factories using high-voltage lines.",

        "selftext": "We are a Muslim family from Maharashtra, and I am sharing my sister’s painful story. She was married in 2020 through an arranged marriage. The groom’s family seemed educated but turned out to be extremely controlling and orthodox. From the very first day, my sister faced mental and physical abuse.\n\nHere’s what she went through:\n\n1. **No Freedom from Day One:** On the first day after her wedding, her in-laws took away her phone and sent it back to us. When she asked her husband, he told her that daughters-in-law in their house are not allowed to have phones and she should use his phone instead. To avoid arguments, my sister gave up her phone and her connection to the outside world.\n2. **Total Control Over Her Life:** Her in-laws controlled everything—what she wore, who she talked to, what she ate, even how and when she laughed.\n3. **No Respect in Her Marriage:** Her husband ignored her completely. He spent most of his time with a girl named \"Gudiya,\" who lived with the family but wasn’t related to them. Shockingly, they even shared my sister’s bed while she was forced to sleep on the floor. He avoided talking to her and came home late at night to avoid any confrontation.\n4. **Her Career Dreams Crushed:** My sister is highly qualified (MA in Geography and B.Ed) and wanted to become a professor. Her husband was also a teacher before their marriage, so we thought he would support her dreams. But after marriage, she found out he had quit his job because his mother told him to. When she tried to prepare for exams like NET/SET, her sister-in-law created drama and stopped her from studying.\n5. **No Healthcare or Basic Dignity:** If she fell sick, she was mocked for being weak. They refused to take her to the doctor unless her condition was serious.\n6. **Gold and Dowry Demands:** Her in-laws constantly praised their elder daughter-in-law for bringing dowry and gold every month. They took all the gold my sister brought with her and kept it in a bank without her consent.\n\nShe silently endured this abuse for two years before finally telling us everything. We immediately filed a domestic violence case against her in-laws and husband.\n\n**Legal Struggles**\n\nSince filing the case, her in-laws have avoided every court hearing by manipulating the police and the system. Over a year has passed, and they haven’t attended a single hearing. Meanwhile, my sister has to go to every hearing, reliving her trauma.\n\nEven when a non-bailable warrant was issued, they managed to escape. Their lawyer even got permission for them to skip court appearances. The judge handling the case seems hesitant to take any action, leaving my sister stuck.\n\nTo make things worse, during this time, her husband secretly married another woman without my sister’s consent. While he lives happily, my sister is left to deal with endless legal battles and mental pain.\n\nWe once thought of settling the matter out of court to get her a divorce, but her in-laws refused. They want to “set an example” for other daughters-in-law, showing what happens if they speak out.\n\n**We are desperate for help.** All we want is for my sister to get a divorce and move on with her life.\n\n**Questions We Need Help With:**\n\n1. How can we speed up the court process and make sure her in-laws and husband are held responsible?\n2. What legal steps can we take to secure a divorce and protect her future?\n3. How do we fight the manipulation of the police and courts by her in-laws?\n4. Can stricter action be taken against her husband for marrying another woman without her consent?\n\nPlease help us. My sister deserves a chance to live her life with dignity and hope.",

I met the ARO, and he said he would do the work after coming for inspection and the remaining 3 offices. Also, I have to pay, so he'll give a new pid number, and I agreed.\" - This is a direct quote.\n\nDecember 2024: We followed up with the seller again, and he replied: \"That also is at standstill as the sakala site is crashed from 2 months - no khatas and no e khata is being made.\" \n\nJanuary 2025: We followed up with the seller, and he asked for the sale deed copy so he could submit the Affidavit for Khata Bifurcation to get individual numbers for the offices on the floor on which our office is located. I confirmed with him today if he submitted and paid the fees in total. He said yes.\n\nBecause of this delay, we are unable to sell the office. In such a situation, does the buyer have a right to cancel the purchase although the property has been registered? Also, two companies refused to rent the office because we didn't have a khata.",

Please feel free to give any info about individual points as well. \n\n1) So A is the only one in possession of the original will and all other survey papers (at least claims to be) and with his he is always encroaching everyone’s property by stating that XYZ have built houses outside the boundaries. \n\nI figure I can get the survey results through a legal process, but the will and other documents, is there a legal process to request him to share all documents that he claims to be the sources with others?\n\n2) A and XYZ agreed to give the said property to a builder for development purposes in 2001. There was some advance money paid out by the builder and there was no development started by the developer in a long time. Since XYZ had no employment, they took out several more advances throughout the years from the said builder, now 20 years later, there is still no development and even though we’re willing to pay the money back (even with interest) the developer isn’t make any progress. \n\nWhat can we do in this situation? \n\nThis has been going on since I was a kid and now I earn quite well and I want to help my dad using some money I can spend. It’s been really hard to see him struggle with his relatives. Any input or suggestions of legal teams are welcome! Thank you for taking the time to read!  ",

        "selftext": "Hi,   \n  \nI want to know certain things. I have been living in rent in a property managed by The Helloworld Coliving in Mumbai. I am facing a fundamental necessity issue, which is drinking water, for which they were supposed to put up a water purifier on the property. They provide water that the property's caretaker refills from another property, and a 20ltr can be used for five people. I have faced multiple issues, such as   \n1. Refilling the water from my friend's place.   \n2. No water available in the middle of the night  \n3. The caretaker not being available to get water, which I have to purchase from Blinkit  \n  \nI had raised multiple complaints with their support team, but they closed the ticket without providing an update or getting a customer response. Their customer service number is provided on the website. I called multiple times, but no one answered the calls. Sometimes, someone responded, but they lack basic essentialnication and accountability. \n\nThe biggest culprit is the property manager; I am sure he has never visited the property. He does most of his work via phone like a mafia boss. Most of the time, he has made false promises and no accountability. Whenever an issue is raised in a call, he gives vague timelines like \"it will be done\". And the biggest irony is that there is only one property manager for the entire location. The support team mainly contacts the property manager to resolve tickets. IItis like a Ponzi scheme where the issue goes completely unheard. I am paying 30k as rent for one single room; I mean, there is a TV, a F#\\*\\*ING TV in the amenities, which is entirely useless but no Water Purifier. The management should be pretty dumb and lame to come up with this.\n\n  \nNow the reason I am facing eviction is I have already mentioned to the support team on email that I will be withholding my rent payment until my issue is fixed which they don't seem to care about as they closed those support tickets which I have raised saying the issue has been fixed but in ground reality nothing's been done. I am clear that when I signed the agreement Water Purifer was part of the amenities that they were supposed to provide. What should I do in this case?",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI need some legal advice regarding a complicated situation.\n\nBackground: I come from a lower-income family. My mother left me immediately when I was born due to psychiatric issues and has lived with her parents for over 25 years. Dad tried applying for divorce, but with no address, no answer or response, he didn't get the divorce. I grew up with my father’s parents, who passed away in 2018.\n\nAfter 15+ years of waiting, My dad (58) found a live-in partner in 2010 who agreed to live without divorce or marriage initially.. She (40) a divorcee with two kids from her first marriage. She didn't tell anything and all lies about her first husband being drunkard and so on. \nThings went downhill quickly with her living in my home— within 1 month my grandparents started losing things, theft, bad behavior, and targeting on property. Whenever dad is at home she acts like an angel with me and grandparents.\n\nGrandparents kicked her out within 1 month and my dad and she have lived separately since 2012 in a rented home.\n\nI am disabled and 90% deaf, and I live in the house my grandparents built in Bangalore. My dad visits daily to help me out with household chores.\n\nIn 2015, dad discovered she had an affair in her first marriage that led to her divorce. Even with dad she had affairs late night talks and dad once caught a guy in home when she was alone. She just brushed it off saying friends. \n\nIn 2017, she had lung cancer, which she made my dad financially supported for operation and recovery.\n\nIn 2018, she had medical treatment to conceive again and ended up having a child without my dad’s decision as well. We don't even know if the kid belongs to dad. She hid this news until the 6th month.\n\nIn 2021, they had a violent fight, leading to police involvement. She took the child and ran to Kerala. She’s using the child to emotionally blackmail dad and has sent legal notices to my address claiming dowry and demanding to live in my home. Despite her issues, people seem to side with her. She tried to barge into my home and dad tried to push her out, leading to my name being included in an FIR.\n\nNow, in 2025, a similar fight happened in their rental home and police were called again.\n\nShe’s sending more legal notices through lawyers in Kerala and demands my dad appear before the Kerala Vanitha Committee on a date. \nThis notice came through my home address and dad unknowingly signed and took the letter, later he was regretting he should not have taken in my home address. \n\nThe latest issue is that she wants to live in my home, as my dad has no income.\nAnd she wants dad to marry her in order to see the child or to be in peace, else she would work on creating issues. \n\nMy dad has a small 1BHK near Electronic City around agricultural land, but she refuses to live there and insists on coming to my home.\n\nShe is also trying to involve me in all this and I suspect she'll again try to enter my home forcefully to live in.\n\nI’m already struggling with my disability unable to work effectively, lost my future, and finances aspects, and now the added legal fees and headache are difficult to pay. \n\nMy home is still in my grandparents' name, and I need to settle a amount as per will with my dad's sister to own it in my name which i am yet to do. \n\nWhat can I legally do to stop her from sending these notices and pulling me into this mess?\nCan i send a return notice to not disturb me and my dad does not stay here in my home? \n\nI don’t want her to stay in my home. Should I send a response to the lawyer stating my dad doesn’t live with me full-time? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nI’m also worried for my dad, who is 58 and having knee issues and worsening health not sure what kind of trouble will he be in. \nHow can i help my dad here. I know he did msny mistakes. But he supports me and understand my issues and try to help me as much as possible. \n\nI have no one to approach or ask for help, no relatives would come in for help unless there is a death. ",

Some rude messages were exchanged and then that person (friend) stopped. \n1. We filed an FIR against all the 4 anonymous Insta accounts. \n1. The police got their real names from Meta company. \n1.

        "selftext": "\n\nI need advice regarding my eligibility for a teaching post and whether I should pursue a court case to claim the position. Here’s my situation:\n\n1. Background:\n\nI applied for a teaching post where the notification mentioned that only candidates with a B.Ed. in Special Education are eligible.\n\nHowever, I knew the qualifications mentioned in the notification were incomplete because, based on past vacancies, candidates with a graduation + special diploma (recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India, RCI) were also eligible.\n\nThe RCI is the only body authorized to decide eligibility criteria for such posts, not the government.\n\n\n\n2. My Qualifications at the Time:\n\nI had a special diploma and was pursuing my graduation. However, my graduation was incomplete at the time of application.\n\nDespite this, I filled out the form, sat for the exam, and scored more than 20 marks above the cutoff (in the 2x result list).\n\n\n\n3. Current Scenario:\n\nI did not attend document verification because I had not completed my graduation by the last date of application, as per the notification’s criteria. , also government was only allowing special bed candidates\n\nMeanwhile, the government sought clarification from the RCI regarding qualifications, and the RCI confirmed that diploma holders (like me) are also valid for the post.\n\nAnd after 6-8 months due to some answers get changed, 2x result was canceled, and a new, fresh result was released today. My roll number is still in this list.\n\n\n\n4. Dilemma:\n\nThe notification clearly stated that all qualifications must be completed by the last date of application, which I did not meet.\n\nHowever, I believe I am eligible for the post based on RCI's clarification and past precedence.\n\nI desperately need this job, and I worked incredibly hard for it.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\nDo I have a strong case if I file a court petition?\n\nWhat legal arguments can I make to strengthen my case?\n\nAre there any past judgments or legal principles that could support my claim?\n\n\nI understand my chances might be slim, but I want to explore all possible options.

        "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI had placed an order with Zara for 8 items worth 21k in Dec 2024. Unfortunately, all the items had some issue or the other in terms of size and fit so I decided to return it. I raised a request to return the items on 30th Dec and my order was picked up by a Delhivery guy on 31st Dec 2024. The person who picked it up was behaving very strangely. As he went through each item to confirm everything was there with all tags intact, he kept asking me the total value of the order and saying \"Ye order toh kaafi mehenga hoga na madam?\" \nI didn't respond and asked him to verify if it was him who was supposed to pick it up. And he said yes and that it was his first day of work so he is new to all this. I verified his phone number from the Delhivery app and then handed him my entire parcel. I later got an email from Delhivery that day that my order was picked up. \n\nOn 3rd Jan 2025, I received and email from Delhivery that my parcel was returned to Zara warehouse. Usually, when we return items to Zara, we get an email from them confirming that they have received it and the refund will be processed. I kept waiting for that email but didn't get one. I contacted Zara's customer service on 10th Jan 2025 and they told me they had only received one sweater in the parcel and it was a non-Zara item so they will not be giving me a refund. I have been chasing them ever since through calls every other day and their executives keep telling me to wait for 24-48 hours as my case has been expedited. But it's going to be month since I returned all the items. \n\nI have my suspicions that the Delhivery pickup guy stole my parcel and handed them random item. But I have not even been able to reach out to Delhivery since they deactivate their AWBs within 15 days. And their automated customer service says to contact the seller. And Zara has been utterly useless in those terms. \n\nI really need my money back. \n\nIs this worth filing a case in consumer court? How can we do it? Or is there any other way I can get them to give my refund. ",

        "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nThanks in advance for reading this huge wall of text :)\n\nA family member of mine booked a wedding hall/banquet situated in Sec 56 Gurgaon on July 7th 2024. They paid 90000 as a booking amount of the total Rs 3,15,000 (Food and Venue only, no decoration.). \n\nThey had booked the pool side venue, however at the time of booking, the pool was operational for members and functions were not being conducted. The Salesperson told us that we can come in November to look at their poolside functions to finalize our decoration.\n\nFast forward to end of November, we had not heard anything from the sales person, and after following up with her multiple times to give us a time to visit the venue for tasting and to see the decoration, she finally gave us a date of Dec 4th. She had informed us that there would be a wedding function in the eve of 4th Dec where we can see sample decoration and taste the food. \n\nWhen on Dec 4th we reached the venue, it was in an ABYSSMAL condition. It looked like they were taking apart the decoration instead of putting it up. Keep in mind that we went there at 8 pm, and the wedding guests had almost started to arrive. \n\nThe entire venue was covered in used straws and disposable spoons/plates, maybe from the day before function and nobody had bothered cleaning it up. The sofa for the bride and groom was dirty and torn and had food/stains marks all over. The low chairs for the bride and groom during pheras, were dirty, and had holes in them. Without getting into more details, it was a very horrible setup.\n\nNow based on all of this, we decided to confront the sales lady (who had been trying to avoid us the entire time btw), and we told them to cancel the venue. \n\nWe had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. With to and fro with the venue management, we were able to get them to send an email to us stating that they will refund \"the amount that we paid at the time of booking\" and that we can expect the refund in 3rd week of January 2025. \n\nHowever, since passing of 3rd week of Jan 2025, they have stopped responding and keep saying that they will send a final date soon. \n\nTldr: A family member booked a poolside wedding venue in Sec 56, Gurgaon, for July 7, 2024, paying ₹90,000 upfront (total ₹3,15,000). The salesperson promised a visit in November to view decorations and food tasting, but after delays, they finally scheduled it for Dec 4. Upon visiting, the venue was in terrible condition—dirty, torn furniture, and no proper setup despite an ongoing event. The family decided to cancel, however they had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. Upon negotiations, the family got an email confirmation of a refund with the venue management. The venue promised a refund by mid-Jan 2025 but has since stopped responding and delayed giving a final refund date. \n\nWhat legal steps can the family take to recover this amount? \n\n",

It’s going to be little long but he actually needs help so please read\n\nHe met a girl in 2019 they fell in love and started living together later he got to know that she was married but she said they got divorced and he trusted her! Then 6 months into the relationship she was after him to get married within 5-10 days as her mother was sick and there won’t be any auspicious day after 30th of some month i don’t remember. He tried to explain her that marriage doesn’t happen quickly and he doesn’t earn enough to be married and he also want big wedding someday! But she kept forcing him by saying I don’t care about big wedding i want small wedding!\nIt was just after lockdown and they got married in Arya samaj.\n\nAfter 1 year of marriage she started behaving controlling like leave your friends stay home with me all the time! Mind that she was 5-6 years older to him, he didn’t want to leave his friends and wanted to drink occasionally  with his friends but whenever he made plans she threatened him by saying i will jump from the building or i will cut my hand!\n\nBefore this threatening happened, my friend bought a house on his name and made his wife the nominee! But later on he could not take all this and he ran off!\n\nIt’s been 3 years since he has left his own home! She took all the stuff from the house which had some very expensive stuff also! She took property papers too which is in her bank locker! \n\nWhen she didn’t respond to mutual divorce! My friend met a girl and have been living with her and wants to marry her so he decided to talk to an advocate! Now he got to know she was married before but never divorced her first husband! Lawyer told him if my friend wants to marry again he can but he needs to forget about his own house any all the stuff including money in joint account with her!\n\nNow finally his wife filled a complaint saying he tortured her basically 498 or something! And she also included his mother and sister in it when he has been living away from family for past 11 years and she met the family twice only that too for lunch or dinner only!\n\nSo he wants to know that she can take away his home and joint account money? Which is his only asset as his family doesn’t talk to him and have nothing else. And as she is not divorced before so can she still claim everything ?",

I contacted them via email regarding the same and I was shocked by their reply. They said and I quote - \n\n\"I'm sorry to hear about the damage to your product. Unfortunately, according to our policy, we do not provide a warranty if the product is damaged or lost due to improper use. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.\"\n\nIt's not even due to outside damage or misuse which they mention in their warranty terms, it's literally the cheap quality of plastic used in the headband. Also if it's not covered under the warranty claim, then why replace them for customers outside of India? This is a well known defect and they've very much acknowledged it in the past as well, I am positively mystified at this remark.\n\nIs there something I can do legally to get them to honor this warranty claim? Seems like they've shut down my ticket too.",

However, I recently received an objection from the Registrar, stating that a part of the name is already registered by someone else in the same class.\n\nA few small law firms have contacted me, offering to assist with drafting and filing a response to the objection for a relatively low fee. They indicated that no hearing would be required since there’s only one cited mark, and they believe the chances of acceptance are good.\n\nIn contrast, I consulted an IP lawyer in my city, who explained that the process involves filing a response, attending 1–3 hearings, and then having the trademark granted by the Registrar, after which it would be open for public scrutiny. His fee for handling the response and hearings is significantly higher—three times the amount quoted by the smaller firms.\n\nTo the IP lawyers in this sub: What is the correct way forward?

        "selftext": "Context:\n\nMy mother is a Physical Education teacher at a government school in Bengaluru.\n\nAfter the Republic Day celebrations, she visited her school in the evening to take down and fold the national flag.\n\n\nWhat Happened:\n\n1. She discovered that massive, decades-old trees on the school campus had been cut down.\n\n\n2. The school headmaster had permission to cut only one dead/dried-out tree and this was done by the concerned authorities by following the procedure few days back\n\n\n3. But yesterday (26/1/25) me and my mom saw that the headmaster has illegally cut two healthy trees without proper authorization (she wasn't present at the sight) and we have a video evidence of the man admitting that the headmaster has payed him to cut.\n\n\n4. The wood from these trees is very valuable and is intended for personal profit.\n\n\n5. As per procedure, tree-felling requires permission from BBMP or the Karnataka Forest Department, who also handle the cutting and removal process. This wasn’t followed.\n\n\n6. My mother recorded videos of the site as evidence and is considering filing a complaint.\n\n\n\nMy Concerns:\n\nIf my mother or I escalate this (e.g., filing a complaint or posting on Twitter), could we face any legal trouble or retaliation from the school/headmaster?\n\nIs there any other legal procedure or body we should approach to address this?\n\n\nKey Questions for Advice:\n\n1. What are the potential legal risks for us if we take this forward?\n\n\n2. What steps should we take to ensure this is handled legally and safely?\n\n\n3. Is there any way to ensure anonymity for my mother while filing the complaint? I'm planning to post this on X(twitter) since benguluru police are active there from what I know ",

The redBus team suggested that I book another ticket on my own while they escalated the issue for a refund, asking me to wait 48 hours for a resolution.

In addition, a couple of days ago, I also received a Property Tax Demand (Rs. 16K or so) from the BMC meaning he hasn't been paying that either. I have been forwarding these to him over WhatsApp.\n\nThe society office is on my side, and are asking me not to pay the rent for the next month (I planned to pay it as per schedule on Feb 5). They say this will put adequate pressure on him to turn up and clear their bill. Should I proceed with not paying?\n\nAlso, I don't want to deal with this headache anyway - can I just take the hit on my security deposit and walk away, no questions asked? The security deposit is worth approx 3 months of rent. The agreement has a clause saying there is a lock-in period of 6 months, but it also states in another part that the landlord is responsible for paying all the bills. \n\nWhat should I do?",

        "selftext": "This post is based on my understanding of the **Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill, 2024**. If there are any mistakes or inaccuracies, please let me know in the comments! I'm happy to learn and discuss. 😊\n\n# Uttarakhand Implements Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in 2024\n\nThe Uttarakhand government has introduced the **Uniform Civil Code (UCC)**, making it the first Indian state to adopt a unified legal framework for all its residents. This law simplifies and regulates matters like **marriage, divorce, inheritance**, and **live-in relationships**, ensuring everyone is treated equally under the same set of laws, regardless of their religion or cultural practices.\n\n# Key Points of the UCC\n\n1. **Marriage Rules:**\n   * Both partners must be **unmarried** at the time of marriage.\n   * Minimum age for marriage: **21 years for men, 18 years for women.**\n   * Marriage between close relatives (prohibited relationships) is not allowed unless permitted by specific customs, and those customs must not go against public policy.\n2. **Polygamy Banned:**\n   * Polygamy is **prohibited for everyone**, including communities where it was previously allowed (e.g., Muslim personal laws).\n   * Only **monogamous marriages** will be legally valid under the UCC.\n3. **Mandatory Marriage Registration:**\n   * Every marriage, even if solemnized outside Uttarakhand, must be registered with the authorities if at least one partner is a resident of the state.\n   * Marriages conducted since **2010** must also be registered retroactively.\n4. **Live-in Relationships:**\n   * Couples in live-in relationships must register their partnership within **30 days** of living together.\n   * **Children born from live-in relationships are considered legitimate** and will have inheritance rights.\n   * Women deserted by live-in partners can claim **financial support (maintenance)** through the courts.\n5. **Equal Inheritance Rights:**\n   * Both sons and daughters are given **equal inheritance rights** to their parents’ property, ensuring gender equality.\n6. **Religious Freedom for Ceremonies:**\n   * Couples can marry following their own religious or customary traditions, such as **Saptapadi, Nikah, Holy Union**, or **Anand Karaj.**\n\n# Who Does It Apply To?\n\n* The UCC applies to **all residents of Uttarakhand**, even those living outside the state.\n* **Scheduled Tribes** and groups with **protected customary practices** under the Constitution are exempt from this Code.\n\n# What Changes Under the UCC?\n\nThe UCC replaces personal laws based on religion with a **common set of rules** for everyone. For example:\n\n* Practices like **polygamy** are no longer allowed.\n* There is now a standardized procedure for marriage, divorce, and property inheritance.\n* Women in both marriages and live-in relationships have clear legal protections.\n\nFINE AND IMPRISONMENT \n\n* Under the Uttarakhand UCC, 2024, failing to submit a live-in relationship statement can result in:\n\nFine: Up to ₹10,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 3 months.\n\nProviding false information or ignoring notices can lead to stricter penalties, including:\n\nFine: Up to ₹25,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 6 months.",

Here’s the situation:\n\n* My father already has a passport, but it expired 5 years ago.\n* He renewed his passport in 2009, and at that time, due to a misunderstanding, his name was recorded incorrectly. Specifically, his grandfather’s name (father's father's name) was included, resulting in a trimmed/abbreviated version of his actual name.\n* Now, his old passport has a name that doesn’t match his Aadhaar card or other documents.\n\nWe recently applied for a passport renewal and visited the Passport Seva Kendra with all the necessary documents for a name correction. However, the officer in charge put the application on hold and insisted that we update the name on his Aadhaar card to match the old passport.\n\nWhile changing the name on the Aadhaar card is possible, it would create a ripple effect, as many other documents (bank accounts, property papers, etc.) are linked to the current name on his Aadhaar. This is the name we prefer to maintain, as it’s consistent across all other documents.\n\nOur goal is to correct the name in the passport to match the Aadhaar card, rather than changing the Aadhaar card to match the old passport. Is there any way to achieve this? Has anyone faced a similar situation or have advice on how to resolve this issue?\n\nAny guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Her father lost her job during covid after which they joined vestige (scam ass foundation). after which the entire family is not looking towards developing skills but to enroll in more and more these kinds of scams. I have proof that she has THOUSANDS (yes im certain) of Aadhaar cards, photographs and stuff which im sure are ILLEGAL .. These Aadhaar cards were used for kyc for these new joiners and she used to send me those to edit (crop tilt etc) since i had a good hand in editing. These ids belonged to ppl from villages and ppl living in slums and u can tell they ain't well off that why enrolling in this scheme . I tried multiple time to make them stop but then the entire family is brainwashed to hell. Is there anything i can do to stop them without coming in picture?.. or is it too late?.. The father is still unemployed. elder child completed their studies and younger child is still studying in clg yet somehow they're still enrolled in this shit\n\nHhttps://www.jaalifestyle.com/\n\nthis is one of the website in which they're enrolled. just by looking u can tell its a scam.\n\ni really want to help them .. cus what they're doing (such as having 1000s of adhaar cards) is damn sure illegal and i don't want them to get into huge trouble for that.",

Eventually, I introduced him to my husband and family, but they didn’t like him.

He says he loves me a lot and is possessive, telling me I shouldn’t talk to anyone else. I tried to fight back, saying I want to continue talking to this person, but then my husband told my family about everything, and things got worse. My mom became physically abusive, and my family started saying awful things to me—things I never imagined they’d say.**\n\n**I feel trapped. My family is now threatening to hurt both me and the person I want to stay in touch with if I leave or continue talking to him. I’m staying with my husband for the sake of my kids, even though I feel completely helpless. The person I wanted to talk to is no longer speaking to me, and my family completely hates both me and him now.**\n\n**I’m terrified to even reach out to him, as my husband is tracking my phone and messages and has been threatening me. I honestly don’t know what to do. All are ignoring me and not letting me leave as well. I feel stuck, scared, and like I have no way out. Does anyone have advice on how to navigate this?**",

It’s in an unsafe condition, with structural instability, burnt debris, and residual oil spills. Despite this, the previous tenant is trying to resume operations there, posing serious risks to public safety.\n\nHere’s what has happened so far:\n\n1. A grievance was filed with the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office, and the issue was forwarded to the District Joint Director (LSGD) and then to the Panchayat.\n\n1. The Panchayat’s investigation report merely stated that “the building is partially ruined” without addressing concerns like structural instability or chemical hazards. No actions have been taken so far.\n\n1. The grievance was closed by the Joint Director's office without verifying if the Panchayat's response addressed the concerns or if any appropriate action was taken.\n\n1. When approached, the Panchayat, the officials said that the Panchayat isn’t responsible for stopping businesses from operating in unsafe premises, but they didn’t clarify which authority is.\n\nI’m not sure what to do next. I’ve contacted multiple authorities, but no action has been taken so far.\n\nMy questions:\n\n* Which authority is responsible for preventing businesses from operating in unsafe buildings in Kerala?\n\n* Should this be escalated to any higher authority?\n\n* Is there any foul play happening? Is that the reason no authority is taking any action?\n\n* How can I ensure that this matter is taken seriously and that action is initiated?\n\nI will attach photos of the burnt building for reference. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!\n\n ",

Since then, I have not gotten my car back. It’s been almost 9 months, and dealing with Zoomcar has been a nightmare.\n\nAfter repeated attempts to get in touch, their lawyer finally called me and informed me that my car has been impounded by the Bihar police. Apparently, the person who rented my car used it to smuggle a huge quantity of alcohol. Since the smuggler wasn’t caught during the incident, they charged me—the car owner—as an accused.\n\nThe lawyer told me I need to:\n\nGo to Bihar to get bail for my name.\nFile cases in the civil court, DM court, and then the high court to get my car back.\n\nThey also said Zoomcar cannot help me further.\nI hired a lawyer to handle this, but after 9 months, there has been no progress. This situation has taken a massive toll on my mental health. My family, work, and studies are all suffering, and I’m experiencing severe anxiety and depression because of this ordeal.\n\nI feel completely helpless and stuck. Has anyone faced a similar issue or can guide me on what to do next? Are there any legal steps I can take against Zoomcar for their negligence or lack of support?\n\nAny advice or suggestions would mean the world to me. Thank you in advance!\n",

I’ve marked the old wire line with ----. Now, our neighbor also wants to shift the poles to the end of their land along the highway. The last two poles are on our land, forming a straight line perpendicular to the road.\n\nThey are saying it won’t be possible without our cooperation (but I know that even if we don’t shift our pole, which is already on our land away from the highway, the second pole near the highway is in the right place). We can't refuse outright because we live in a village and are expected to cooperate.\n\nThe issue is the total cost. The electricity department has quoted around **₹3.5 lakhs** for the shift. They say we will get an official receipt from the government. Since the poles are on the land of three families (including ours), our share of the cost would be around **₹1.2 lakhs**.\n\nI want to understand the process for this:\n\n1. Can they charge this much?\n2. Is it true that the electricity department installs new poles when shifting old ones?\n\n**Other info:**\n\n* **State**: Uk\n* Why shift - We currently have no problem with the poles being on our land since the area is used for farming. However, some neighbors have built buildings nearby, so they are the ones who want this shift.\n* The poles don’t supply electricity to the village (not sure), but I think they are primarily for factories using high-voltage lines.",

        "selftext": "We are a Muslim family from Maharashtra, and I am sharing my sister’s painful story. She was married in 2020 through an arranged marriage. The groom’s family seemed educated but turned out to be extremely controlling and orthodox. From the very first day, my sister faced mental and physical abuse.\n\nHere’s what she went through:\n\n1. **No Freedom from Day One:** On the first day after her wedding, her in-laws took away her phone and sent it back to us. When she asked her husband, he told her that daughters-in-law in their house are not allowed to have phones and she should use his phone instead. To avoid arguments, my sister gave up her phone and her connection to the outside world.\n2. **Total Control Over Her Life:** Her in-laws controlled everything—what she wore, who she talked to, what she ate, even how and when she laughed.\n3. **No Respect in Her Marriage:** Her husband ignored her completely. He spent most of his time with a girl named \"Gudiya,\" who lived with the family but wasn’t related to them. Shockingly, they even shared my sister’s bed while she was forced to sleep on the floor. He avoided talking to her and came home late at night to avoid any confrontation.\n4. **Her Career Dreams Crushed:** My sister is highly qualified (MA in Geography and B.Ed) and wanted to become a professor. Her husband was also a teacher before their marriage, so we thought he would support her dreams. But after marriage, she found out he had quit his job because his mother told him to. When she tried to prepare for exams like NET/SET, her sister-in-law created drama and stopped her from studying.\n5. **No Healthcare or Basic Dignity:** If she fell sick, she was mocked for being weak. They refused to take her to the doctor unless her condition was serious.\n6. **Gold and Dowry Demands:** Her in-laws constantly praised their elder daughter-in-law for bringing dowry and gold every month. They took all the gold my sister brought with her and kept it in a bank without her consent.\n\nShe silently endured this abuse for two years before finally telling us everything. We immediately filed a domestic violence case against her in-laws and husband.\n\n**Legal Struggles**\n\nSince filing the case, her in-laws have avoided every court hearing by manipulating the police and the system. Over a year has passed, and they haven’t attended a single hearing. Meanwhile, my sister has to go to every hearing, reliving her trauma.\n\nEven when a non-bailable warrant was issued, they managed to escape. Their lawyer even got permission for them to skip court appearances. The judge handling the case seems hesitant to take any action, leaving my sister stuck.\n\nTo make things worse, during this time, her husband secretly married another woman without my sister’s consent. While he lives happily, my sister is left to deal with endless legal battles and mental pain.\n\nWe once thought of settling the matter out of court to get her a divorce, but her in-laws refused. They want to “set an example” for other daughters-in-law, showing what happens if they speak out.\n\n**We are desperate for help.** All we want is for my sister to get a divorce and move on with her life.\n\n**Questions We Need Help With:**\n\n1. How can we speed up the court process and make sure her in-laws and husband are held responsible?\n2. What legal steps can we take to secure a divorce and protect her future?\n3. How do we fight the manipulation of the police and courts by her in-laws?\n4. Can stricter action be taken against her husband for marrying another woman without her consent?\n\nPlease help us. My sister deserves a chance to live her life with dignity and hope.",

I confirmed with him today if he submitted and paid the fees in total. He said yes.\n\nBecause of this delay, we are unable to sell the office. In such a situation, does the buyer have a right to cancel the purchase although the property has been registered? Also, two companies refused to rent the office because we didn't have a khata.",

There was some advance money paid out by the builder and there was no development started by the developer in a long time. Since XYZ had no employment, they took out several more advances throughout the years from the said builder, now 20 years later, there is still no development and even though we’re willing to pay the money back (even with interest) the developer isn’t make any progress. \n\nWhat can we do in this situation? \n\nThis has been going on since I was a kid and now I earn quite well and I want to help my dad using some money I can spend.

        "selftext": "Hi,   \n  \nI want to know certain things. I have been living in rent in a property managed by The Helloworld Coliving in Mumbai. I am facing a fundamental necessity issue, which is drinking water, for which they were supposed to put up a water purifier on the property. They provide water that the property's caretaker refills from another property, and a 20ltr can be used for five people. I have faced multiple issues, such as   \n1. Refilling the water from my friend's place.   \n2. No water available in the middle of the night  \n3. The caretaker not being available to get water, which I have to purchase from Blinkit  \n  \nI had raised multiple complaints with their support team, but they closed the ticket without providing an update or getting a customer response. Their customer service number is provided on the website. I called multiple times, but no one answered the calls. Sometimes, someone responded, but they lack basic essentialnication and accountability. \n\nThe biggest culprit is the property manager; I am sure he has never visited the property. He does most of his work via phone like a mafia boss. Most of the time, he has made false promises and no accountability. Whenever an issue is raised in a call, he gives vague timelines like \"it will be done\". And the biggest irony is that there is only one property manager for the entire location. The support team mainly contacts the property manager to resolve tickets. IItis like a Ponzi scheme where the issue goes completely unheard. I am paying 30k as rent for one single room; I mean, there is a TV, a F#\\*\\*ING TV in the amenities, which is entirely useless but no Water Purifier. The management should be pretty dumb and lame to come up with this.\n\n  \nNow the reason I am facing eviction is I have already mentioned to the support team on email that I will be withholding my rent payment until my issue is fixed which they don't seem to care about as they closed those support tickets which I have raised saying the issue has been fixed but in ground reality nothing's been done. I am clear that when I signed the agreement Water Purifer was part of the amenities that they were supposed to provide. What should I do in this case?",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI need some legal advice regarding a complicated situation.\n\nBackground: I come from a lower-income family. My mother left me immediately when I was born due to psychiatric issues and has lived with her parents for over 25 years. Dad tried applying for divorce, but with no address, no answer or response, he didn't get the divorce. I grew up with my father’s parents, who passed away in 2018.\n\nAfter 15+ years of waiting, My dad (58) found a live-in partner in 2010 who agreed to live without divorce or marriage initially.. She (40) a divorcee with two kids from her first marriage. She didn't tell anything and all lies about her first husband being drunkard and so on. \nThings went downhill quickly with her living in my home— within 1 month my grandparents started losing things, theft, bad behavior, and targeting on property. Whenever dad is at home she acts like an angel with me and grandparents.\n\nGrandparents kicked her out within 1 month and my dad and she have lived separately since 2012 in a rented home.\n\nI am disabled and 90% deaf, and I live in the house my grandparents built in Bangalore. My dad visits daily to help me out with household chores.\n\nIn 2015, dad discovered she had an affair in her first marriage that led to her divorce. Even with dad she had affairs late night talks and dad once caught a guy in home when she was alone. She just brushed it off saying friends. \n\nIn 2017, she had lung cancer, which she made my dad financially supported for operation and recovery.\n\nIn 2018, she had medical treatment to conceive again and ended up having a child without my dad’s decision as well. We don't even know if the kid belongs to dad. She hid this news until the 6th month.\n\nIn 2021, they had a violent fight, leading to police involvement. She took the child and ran to Kerala. She’s using the child to emotionally blackmail dad and has sent legal notices to my address claiming dowry and demanding to live in my home. Despite her issues, people seem to side with her. She tried to barge into my home and dad tried to push her out, leading to my name being included in an FIR.\n\nNow, in 2025, a similar fight happened in their rental home and police were called again.\n\nShe’s sending more legal notices through lawyers in Kerala and demands my dad appear before the Kerala Vanitha Committee on a date. \nThis notice came through my home address and dad unknowingly signed and took the letter, later he was regretting he should not have taken in my home address. \n\nThe latest issue is that she wants to live in my home, as my dad has no income.\nAnd she wants dad to marry her in order to see the child or to be in peace, else she would work on creating issues. \n\nMy dad has a small 1BHK near Electronic City around agricultural land, but she refuses to live there and insists on coming to my home.\n\nShe is also trying to involve me in all this and I suspect she'll again try to enter my home forcefully to live in.\n\nI’m already struggling with my disability unable to work effectively, lost my future, and finances aspects, and now the added legal fees and headache are difficult to pay. \n\nMy home is still in my grandparents' name, and I need to settle a amount as per will with my dad's sister to own it in my name which i am yet to do. \n\nWhat can I legally do to stop her from sending these notices and pulling me into this mess?\nCan i send a return notice to not disturb me and my dad does not stay here in my home? \n\nI don’t want her to stay in my home. Should I send a response to the lawyer stating my dad doesn’t live with me full-time? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nI’m also worried for my dad, who is 58 and having knee issues and worsening health not sure what kind of trouble will he be in. \nHow can i help my dad here. I know he did msny mistakes. But he supports me and understand my issues and try to help me as much as possible. \n\nI have no one to approach or ask for help, no relatives would come in for help unless there is a death. ",

Around the same time, my sister's old friend who had a new Instagram account also messaged her. We didn't know it was a friend. We thought it was one of the miscreants. Some rude messages were exchanged and then that person (friend) stopped. \n1. We filed an FIR against all the 4 anonymous Insta accounts. \n1. The police got their real names from Meta company. \n1. We also managed to get the names of the account owners from the cops. 2 people who had a quarrel with my sister and 1 old friend (that's how we came to know about the friend's new account). \n1. The friend also got a call from the police and then called us to explain. \n\nSo now, we have a situation where we named an friendly innocent person (along with the real culprits)  in the FIR. \n\nHow can we resolve the situation with minimum trouble to our friend? We don't want the friend to go through the pain of the legal process. ",

Is there a way to force the company to payup, all they said was operational difficulties and i have it on record. from my understanding i think they couldn't get a lot of people on the plane to make it worth the cost of service, but that's not my problem.I think this is a unique case as i spoke to some of the staff and they said not many people had any other flights from flying plans from aizawl",

        "selftext": "\n\nI need advice regarding my eligibility for a teaching post and whether I should pursue a court case to claim the position. Here’s my situation:\n\n1. Background:\n\nI applied for a teaching post where the notification mentioned that only candidates with a B.Ed. in Special Education are eligible.\n\nHowever, I knew the qualifications mentioned in the notification were incomplete because, based on past vacancies, candidates with a graduation + special diploma (recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India, RCI) were also eligible.\n\nThe RCI is the only body authorized to decide eligibility criteria for such posts, not the government.\n\n\n\n2. My Qualifications at the Time:\n\nI had a special diploma and was pursuing my graduation. However, my graduation was incomplete at the time of application.\n\nDespite this, I filled out the form, sat for the exam, and scored more than 20 marks above the cutoff (in the 2x result list).\n\n\n\n3. Current Scenario:\n\nI did not attend document verification because I had not completed my graduation by the last date of application, as per the notification’s criteria. , also government was only allowing special bed candidates\n\nMeanwhile, the government sought clarification from the RCI regarding qualifications, and the RCI confirmed that diploma holders (like me) are also valid for the post.\n\nAnd after 6-8 months due to some answers get changed, 2x result was canceled, and a new, fresh result was released today. My roll number is still in this list.\n\n\n\n4. Dilemma:\n\nThe notification clearly stated that all qualifications must be completed by the last date of application, which I did not meet.\n\nHowever, I believe I am eligible for the post based on RCI's clarification and past precedence.\n\nI desperately need this job, and I worked incredibly hard for it.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\nDo I have a strong case if I file a court petition?\n\nWhat legal arguments can I make to strengthen my case?\n\nAre there any past judgments or legal principles that could support my claim?\n\n\nI understand my chances might be slim, but I want to explore all possible options. Your guidance would mean a lot to me.\n\nThank you!\n\n.\n\n",

Unfortunately, all the items had some issue or the other in terms of size and fit so I decided to return it. I raised a request to return the items on 30th Dec and my order was picked up by a Delhivery guy on 31st Dec 2024. The person who picked it up was behaving very strangely. As he went through each item to confirm everything was there with all tags intact, he kept asking me the total value of the order and saying \"Ye order toh kaafi mehenga hoga na madam?\" \nI didn't respond and asked him to verify if it was him who was supposed to pick it up. And he said yes and that it was his first day of work so he is new to all this. I verified his phone number from the Delhivery app and then handed him my entire parcel. I later got an email from Delhivery that day that my order was picked up. \n\nOn 3rd Jan 2025, I received and email from Delhivery that my parcel was returned to Zara warehouse. Usually, when we return items to Zara, we get an email from them confirming that they have received it and the refund will be processed. I kept waiting for that email but didn't get one. I contacted Zara's customer service on 10th Jan 2025 and they told me they had only received one sweater in the parcel and it was a non-Zara item so they will not be giving me a refund. I have been chasing them ever since through calls every other day and their executives keep telling me to wait for 24-48 hours as my case has been expedited. But it's going to be month since I returned all the items. \n\nI have my suspicions that the Delhivery pickup guy stole my parcel and handed them random item. But I have not even been able to reach out to Delhivery since they deactivate their AWBs within 15 days. And their automated customer service says to contact the seller. And Zara has been utterly useless in those terms. \n\nI really need my money back. \n\nIs this worth filing a case in consumer court? How can we do it? Or is there any other way I can get them to give my refund. ",

        "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nThanks in advance for reading this huge wall of text :)\n\nA family member of mine booked a wedding hall/banquet situated in Sec 56 Gurgaon on July 7th 2024. They paid 90000 as a booking amount of the total Rs 3,15,000 (Food and Venue only, no decoration.). \n\nThey had booked the pool side venue, however at the time of booking, the pool was operational for members and functions were not being conducted. The Salesperson told us that we can come in November to look at their poolside functions to finalize our decoration.\n\nFast forward to end of November, we had not heard anything from the sales person, and after following up with her multiple times to give us a time to visit the venue for tasting and to see the decoration, she finally gave us a date of Dec 4th. She had informed us that there would be a wedding function in the eve of 4th Dec where we can see sample decoration and taste the food. \n\nWhen on Dec 4th we reached the venue, it was in an ABYSSMAL condition. It looked like they were taking apart the decoration instead of putting it up. Keep in mind that we went there at 8 pm, and the wedding guests had almost started to arrive. \n\nThe entire venue was covered in used straws and disposable spoons/plates, maybe from the day before function and nobody had bothered cleaning it up. The sofa for the bride and groom was dirty and torn and had food/stains marks all over. The low chairs for the bride and groom during pheras, were dirty, and had holes in them. Without getting into more details, it was a very horrible setup.\n\nNow based on all of this, we decided to confront the sales lady (who had been trying to avoid us the entire time btw), and we told them to cancel the venue. \n\nWe had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. With to and fro with the venue management, we were able to get them to send an email to us stating that they will refund \"the amount that we paid at the time of booking\" and that we can expect the refund in 3rd week of January 2025. \n\nHowever, since passing of 3rd week of Jan 2025, they have stopped responding and keep saying that they will send a final date soon. \n\nTldr: A family member booked a poolside wedding venue in Sec 56, Gurgaon, for July 7, 2024, paying ₹90,000 upfront (total ₹3,15,000). The salesperson promised a visit in November to view decorations and food tasting, but after delays, they finally scheduled it for Dec 4. Upon visiting, the venue was in terrible condition—dirty, torn furniture, and no proper setup despite an ongoing event. The family decided to cancel, however they had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. Upon negotiations, the family got an email confirmation of a refund with the venue management. The venue promised a refund by mid-Jan 2025 but has since stopped responding and delayed giving a final refund date. \n\nWhat legal steps can the family take to recover this amount? \n\n",

It’s going to be little long but he actually needs help so please read\n\nHe met a girl in 2019 they fell in love and started living together later he got to know that she was married but she said they got divorced and he trusted her! Then 6 months into the relationship she was after him to get married within 5-10 days as her mother was sick and there won’t be any auspicious day after 30th of some month i don’t remember. He tried to explain her that marriage doesn’t happen quickly and he doesn’t earn enough to be married and he also want big wedding someday! But she kept forcing him by saying I don’t care about big wedding i want small wedding!\nIt was just after lockdown and they got married in Arya samaj.\n\nAfter 1 year of marriage she started behaving controlling like leave your friends stay home with me all the time! Mind that she was 5-6 years older to him, he didn’t want to leave his friends and wanted to drink occasionally  with his friends but whenever he made plans she threatened him by saying i will jump from the building or i will cut my hand!\n\nBefore this threatening happened, my friend bought a house on his name and made his wife the nominee! But later on he could not take all this and he ran off!\n\nIt’s been 3 years since he has left his own home! She took all the stuff from the house which had some very expensive stuff also! She took property papers too which is in her bank locker! \n\nWhen she didn’t respond to mutual divorce! My friend met a girl and have been living with her and wants to marry her so he decided to talk to an advocate! Now he got to know she was married before but never divorced her first husband! Lawyer told him if my friend wants to marry again he can but he needs to forget about his own house any all the stuff including money in joint account with her!\n\nNow finally his wife filled a complaint saying he tortured her basically 498 or something! And she also included his mother and sister in it when he has been living away from family for past 11 years and she met the family twice only that too for lunch or dinner only!\n\nSo he wants to know that she can take away his home and joint account money? Which is his only asset as his family doesn’t talk to him and have nothing else. And as she is not divorced before so can she still claim everything ?",

If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.\"\n\nIt's not even due to outside damage or misuse which they mention in their warranty terms, it's literally the cheap quality of plastic used in the headband. Also if it's not covered under the warranty claim, then why replace them for customers outside of India? This is a well known defect and they've very much acknowledged it in the past as well, I am positively mystified at this remark.\n\nIs there something I can do legally to get them to honor this warranty claim?

She discovered that massive, decades-old trees on the school campus had been cut down.\n\n\n2. The school headmaster had permission to cut only one dead/dried-out tree and this was done by the concerned authorities by following the procedure few days back\n\n\n3. But yesterday (26/1/25) me and my mom saw that the headmaster has illegally cut two healthy trees without proper authorization (she wasn't present at the sight) and we have a video evidence of the man admitting that the headmaster has payed him to cut.\n\n\n4. The wood from these trees is very valuable and is intended for personal profit.\n\n\n5. As per procedure, tree-felling requires permission from BBMP or the Karnataka Forest Department, who also handle the cutting and removal process. This wasn’t followed.\n\n\n6. My mother recorded videos of the site as evidence and is considering filing a complaint.\n\n\n\nMy Concerns:\n\nIf my mother or I escalate this (e.g., filing a complaint or posting on Twitter), could we face any legal trouble or retaliation from the school/headmaster?\n\nIs there any other legal procedure or body we should approach to address this?\n\n\nKey Questions for Advice:\n\n1. What are the potential legal risks for us if we take this forward?\n\n\n2. What steps should we take to ensure this is handled legally and safely?\n\n\n3. Is there any way to ensure anonymity for my mother while filing the complaint? I'm planning to post this on X(twitter) since benguluru police are active there from what I know ",

        "selftext": "This post is based on my understanding of the **Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill, 2024**. If there are any mistakes or inaccuracies, please let me know in the comments! I'm happy to learn and discuss. 😊\n\n# Uttarakhand Implements Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in 2024\n\nThe Uttarakhand government has introduced the **Uniform Civil Code (UCC)**, making it the first Indian state to adopt a unified legal framework for all its residents. This law simplifies and regulates matters like **marriage, divorce, inheritance**, and **live-in relationships**, ensuring everyone is treated equally under the same set of laws, regardless of their religion or cultural practices.\n\n# Key Points of the UCC\n\n1. **Marriage Rules:**\n   * Both partners must be **unmarried** at the time of marriage.\n   * Minimum age for marriage: **21 years for men, 18 years for women.**\n   * Marriage between close relatives (prohibited relationships) is not allowed unless permitted by specific customs, and those customs must not go against public policy.\n2. **Polygamy Banned:**\n   * Polygamy is **prohibited for everyone**, including communities where it was previously allowed (e.g., Muslim personal laws).\n   * Only **monogamous marriages** will be legally valid under the UCC.\n3. **Mandatory Marriage Registration:**\n   * Every marriage, even if solemnized outside Uttarakhand, must be registered with the authorities if at least one partner is a resident of the state.\n   * Marriages conducted since **2010** must also be registered retroactively.\n4. **Live-in Relationships:**\n   * Couples in live-in relationships must register their partnership within **30 days** of living together.\n   * **Children born from live-in relationships are considered legitimate** and will have inheritance rights.\n   * Women deserted by live-in partners can claim **financial support (maintenance)** through the courts.\n5. **Equal Inheritance Rights:**\n   * Both sons and daughters are given **equal inheritance rights** to their parents’ property, ensuring gender equality.\n6. **Religious Freedom for Ceremonies:**\n   * Couples can marry following their own religious or customary traditions, such as **Saptapadi, Nikah, Holy Union**, or **Anand Karaj.**\n\n# Who Does It Apply To?\n\n* The UCC applies to **all residents of Uttarakhand**, even those living outside the state.\n* **Scheduled Tribes** and groups with **protected customary practices** under the Constitution are exempt from this Code.\n\n# What Changes Under the UCC?\n\nThe UCC replaces personal laws based on religion with a **common set of rules** for everyone. For example:\n\n* Practices like **polygamy** are no longer allowed.\n* There is now a standardized procedure for marriage, divorce, and property inheritance.\n* Women in both marriages and live-in relationships have clear legal protections.\n\nFINE AND IMPRISONMENT \n\n* Under the Uttarakhand UCC, 2024, failing to submit a live-in relationship statement can result in:\n\nFine: Up to ₹10,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 3 months.\n\nProviding false information or ignoring notices can lead to stricter penalties, including:\n\nFine: Up to ₹25,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 6 months.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI need assistance with a passport issue for my father. The problem is related to a name correction in his passport application. Here’s the situation:\n\n* My father already has a passport, but it expired 5 years ago.\n* He renewed his passport in 2009, and at that time, due to a misunderstanding, his name was recorded incorrectly. Specifically, his grandfather’s name (father's father's name) was included, resulting in a trimmed/abbreviated version of his actual name.\n* Now, his old passport has a name that doesn’t match his Aadhaar card or other documents.\n\nWe recently applied for a passport renewal and visited the Passport Seva Kendra with all the necessary documents for a name correction. However, the officer in charge put the application on hold and insisted that we update the name on his Aadhaar card to match the old passport.\n\nWhile changing the name on the Aadhaar card is possible, it would create a ripple effect, as many other documents (bank accounts, property papers, etc.) are linked to the current name on his Aadhaar. This is the name we prefer to maintain, as it’s consistent across all other documents.\n\nOur goal is to correct the name in the passport to match the Aadhaar card, rather than changing the Aadhaar card to match the old passport. Is there any way to achieve this? Has anyone faced a similar situation or have advice on how to resolve this issue?\n\nAny guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\n",

It’s in an unsafe condition, with structural instability, burnt debris, and residual oil spills. Despite this, the previous tenant is trying to resume operations there, posing serious risks to public safety.\n\nHere’s what has happened so far:\n\n1. A grievance was filed with the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office, and the issue was forwarded to the District Joint Director (LSGD) and then to the Panchayat.\n\n1. The Panchayat’s investigation report merely stated that “the building is partially ruined” without addressing concerns like structural instability or chemical hazards. No actions have been taken so far.\n\n1. The grievance was closed by the Joint Director's office without verifying if the Panchayat's response addressed the concerns or if any appropriate action was taken.\n\n1. When approached, the Panchayat, the officials said that the Panchayat isn’t responsible for stopping businesses from operating in unsafe premises, but they didn’t clarify which authority is.\n\nI’m not sure what to do next. I’ve contacted multiple authorities, but no action has been taken so far.\n\nMy questions:\n\n* Which authority is responsible for preventing businesses from operating in unsafe buildings in Kerala?\n\n* Should this be escalated to any higher authority?\n\n* Is there any foul play happening? Is that the reason no authority is taking any action?\n\n* How can I ensure that this matter is taken seriously and that action is initiated?\n\nI will attach photos of the burnt building for reference. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!\n\n ",

Since then, I have not gotten my car back. It’s been almost 9 months, and dealing with Zoomcar has been a nightmare.\n\nAfter repeated attempts to get in touch, their lawyer finally called me and informed me that my car has been impounded by the Bihar police. Apparently, the person who rented my car used it to smuggle a huge quantity of alcohol. Since the smuggler wasn’t caught during the incident, they charged me—the car owner—as an accused.\n\nThe lawyer told me I need to:\n\nGo to Bihar to get bail for my name.\nFile cases in the civil court, DM court, and then the high court to get my car back.\n\nThey also said Zoomcar cannot help me further.\nI hired a lawyer to handle this, but after 9 months, there has been no progress. This situation has taken a massive toll on my mental health. My family, work, and studies are all suffering, and I’m experiencing severe anxiety and depression because of this ordeal.\n\nI feel completely helpless and stuck. Has anyone faced a similar issue or can guide me on what to do next? Are there any legal steps I can take against Zoomcar for their negligence or lack of support?\n\nAny advice or suggestions would mean the world to me. Thank you in advance!\n",

Since the poles are on the land of three families (including ours), our share of the cost would be around **₹1.2 lakhs**.\n\nI want to understand the process for this:\n\n1. Can they charge this much?\n2. Is it true that the electricity department installs new poles when shifting old ones?\n\n**Other info:**\n\n* **State**: Uk\n* Why shift - We currently have no problem with the poles being on our land since the area is used for farming. However, some neighbors have built buildings nearby, so they are the ones who want this shift.\n* The poles don’t supply electricity to the village (not sure), but I think they are primarily for factories using high-voltage lines.",

For some time the old ladies have not been able to sit in the 'favorite spot' because the tall Neem trees don't let the sunset sunlight reach them in the evening. Also another family who moved in 2 years ago and started planting his home garden in the common area has been unhappy with the Neem trees because his plants don't get direct sunlight. \nBoth parties have made multiple attempts to have the trees cut down. Once we even had to fight the family because the resident was literally up on a neem tree and cutting a branch himself. \nTurns out the MCF guys visited today (not sure if this is true), and said they need to cut some branches because they are touching the electricity grid wires. Well, okay. Assuming it is true, fine. \nBUT. \nThey have CLEARLY CUT SO MUCH MORE THAN NECESSARY. TREES THAT DID NOT EVEN HAVE ANY BRANCHES TOUCHING OR NEAR THE WIRES HAVE BEEN CUT DOWN. \nI spoke to the people cutting it down and they said that some was for the MCF work, but the society families have also come and requested them to cut extra without telling anyone. \n\nWhat can I do here? \n\nIt's painful to see. It's so incredibly wrong. 20+ years of strong, beautiful, lush green trees just cut down. These stupid men and women don't realise that these very trees provided shade in summers, which are increasingly unbearable each year. \n\nI want to slap some legal on the society management so that they know things dont go without consequences. Please help in case anyone has an idea. Thanks a lot in advance. ",

        "selftext": "We are a Muslim family from Maharashtra, and I am sharing my sister’s painful story. She was married in 2020 through an arranged marriage. The groom’s family seemed educated but turned out to be extremely controlling and orthodox. From the very first day, my sister faced mental and physical abuse.\n\nHere’s what she went through:\n\n1. **No Freedom from Day One:** On the first day after her wedding, her in-laws took away her phone and sent it back to us. When she asked her husband, he told her that daughters-in-law in their house are not allowed to have phones and she should use his phone instead. To avoid arguments, my sister gave up her phone and her connection to the outside world.\n2. **Total Control Over Her Life:** Her in-laws controlled everything—what she wore, who she talked to, what she ate, even how and when she laughed.\n3. **No Respect in Her Marriage:** Her husband ignored her completely. He spent most of his time with a girl named \"Gudiya,\" who lived with the family but wasn’t related to them. Shockingly, they even shared my sister’s bed while she was forced to sleep on the floor. He avoided talking to her and came home late at night to avoid any confrontation.\n4. **Her Career Dreams Crushed:** My sister is highly qualified (MA in Geography and B.Ed) and wanted to become a professor. Her husband was also a teacher before their marriage, so we thought he would support her dreams. But after marriage, she found out he had quit his job because his mother told him to. When she tried to prepare for exams like NET/SET, her sister-in-law created drama and stopped her from studying.\n5. **No Healthcare or Basic Dignity:** If she fell sick, she was mocked for being weak. They refused to take her to the doctor unless her condition was serious.\n6. **Gold and Dowry Demands:** Her in-laws constantly praised their elder daughter-in-law for bringing dowry and gold every month. They took all the gold my sister brought with her and kept it in a bank without her consent.\n\nShe silently endured this abuse for two years before finally telling us everything. We immediately filed a domestic violence case against her in-laws and husband.\n\n**Legal Struggles**\n\nSince filing the case, her in-laws have avoided every court hearing by manipulating the police and the system. Over a year has passed, and they haven’t attended a single hearing. Meanwhile, my sister has to go to every hearing, reliving her trauma.\n\nEven when a non-bailable warrant was issued, they managed to escape. Their lawyer even got permission for them to skip court appearances. The judge handling the case seems hesitant to take any action, leaving my sister stuck.\n\nTo make things worse, during this time, her husband secretly married another woman without my sister’s consent. While he lives happily, my sister is left to deal with endless legal battles and mental pain.\n\nWe once thought of settling the matter out of court to get her a divorce, but her in-laws refused. They want to “set an example” for other daughters-in-law, showing what happens if they speak out.\n\n**We are desperate for help.** All we want is for my sister to get a divorce and move on with her life.\n\n**Questions We Need Help With:**\n\n1. How can we speed up the court process and make sure her in-laws and husband are held responsible?\n2. What legal steps can we take to secure a divorce and protect her future?\n3. How do we fight the manipulation of the police and courts by her in-laws?\n4. Can stricter action be taken against her husband for marrying another woman without her consent?\n\nPlease help us. My sister deserves a chance to live her life with dignity and hope.",

There was some advance money paid out by the builder and there was no development started by the developer in a long time. Since XYZ had no employment, they took out several more advances throughout the years from the said builder, now 20 years later, there is still no development and even though we’re willing to pay the money back (even with interest) the developer isn’t make any progress. \n\nWhat can we do in this situation? \n\nThis has been going on since I was a kid and now I earn quite well and I want to help my dad using some money I can spend.

        "selftext": "Hi,   \n  \nI want to know certain things. I have been living in rent in a property managed by The Helloworld Coliving in Mumbai. I am facing a fundamental necessity issue, which is drinking water, for which they were supposed to put up a water purifier on the property. They provide water that the property's caretaker refills from another property, and a 20ltr can be used for five people. I have faced multiple issues, such as   \n1. Refilling the water from my friend's place.   \n2. No water available in the middle of the night  \n3. The caretaker not being available to get water, which I have to purchase from Blinkit  \n  \nI had raised multiple complaints with their support team, but they closed the ticket without providing an update or getting a customer response. Their customer service number is provided on the website. I called multiple times, but no one answered the calls. Sometimes, someone responded, but they lack basic essentialnication and accountability. \n\nThe biggest culprit is the property manager; I am sure he has never visited the property. He does most of his work via phone like a mafia boss. Most of the time, he has made false promises and no accountability. Whenever an issue is raised in a call, he gives vague timelines like \"it will be done\". And the biggest irony is that there is only one property manager for the entire location. The support team mainly contacts the property manager to resolve tickets. IItis like a Ponzi scheme where the issue goes completely unheard. I am paying 30k as rent for one single room; I mean, there is a TV, a F#\\*\\*ING TV in the amenities, which is entirely useless but no Water Purifier. The management should be pretty dumb and lame to come up with this.\n\n  \nNow the reason I am facing eviction is I have already mentioned to the support team on email that I will be withholding my rent payment until my issue is fixed which they don't seem to care about as they closed those support tickets which I have raised saying the issue has been fixed but in ground reality nothing's been done. I am clear that when I signed the agreement Water Purifer was part of the amenities that they were supposed to provide. What should I do in this case?",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI need some legal advice regarding a complicated situation.\n\nBackground: I come from a lower-income family. My mother left me immediately when I was born due to psychiatric issues and has lived with her parents for over 25 years. Dad tried applying for divorce, but with no address, no answer or response, he didn't get the divorce. I grew up with my father’s parents, who passed away in 2018.\n\nAfter 15+ years of waiting, My dad (58) found a live-in partner in 2010 who agreed to live without divorce or marriage initially.. She (40) a divorcee with two kids from her first marriage. She didn't tell anything and all lies about her first husband being drunkard and so on. \nThings went downhill quickly with her living in my home— within 1 month my grandparents started losing things, theft, bad behavior, and targeting on property. Whenever dad is at home she acts like an angel with me and grandparents.\n\nGrandparents kicked her out within 1 month and my dad and she have lived separately since 2012 in a rented home.\n\nI am disabled and 90% deaf, and I live in the house my grandparents built in Bangalore. My dad visits daily to help me out with household chores.\n\nIn 2015, dad discovered she had an affair in her first marriage that led to her divorce. Even with dad she had affairs late night talks and dad once caught a guy in home when she was alone. She just brushed it off saying friends. \n\nIn 2017, she had lung cancer, which she made my dad financially supported for operation and recovery.\n\nIn 2018, she had medical treatment to conceive again and ended up having a child without my dad’s decision as well. We don't even know if the kid belongs to dad. She hid this news until the 6th month.\n\nIn 2021, they had a violent fight, leading to police involvement. She took the child and ran to Kerala. She’s using the child to emotionally blackmail dad and has sent legal notices to my address claiming dowry and demanding to live in my home. Despite her issues, people seem to side with her. She tried to barge into my home and dad tried to push her out, leading to my name being included in an FIR.\n\nNow, in 2025, a similar fight happened in their rental home and police were called again.\n\nShe’s sending more legal notices through lawyers in Kerala and demands my dad appear before the Kerala Vanitha Committee on a date. \nThis notice came through my home address and dad unknowingly signed and took the letter, later he was regretting he should not have taken in my home address. \n\nThe latest issue is that she wants to live in my home, as my dad has no income.\nAnd she wants dad to marry her in order to see the child or to be in peace, else she would work on creating issues. \n\nMy dad has a small 1BHK near Electronic City around agricultural land, but she refuses to live there and insists on coming to my home.\n\nShe is also trying to involve me in all this and I suspect she'll again try to enter my home forcefully to live in.\n\nI’m already struggling with my disability unable to work effectively, lost my future, and finances aspects, and now the added legal fees and headache are difficult to pay. \n\nMy home is still in my grandparents' name, and I need to settle a amount as per will with my dad's sister to own it in my name which i am yet to do. \n\nWhat can I legally do to stop her from sending these notices and pulling me into this mess?\nCan i send a return notice to not disturb me and my dad does not stay here in my home? \n\nI don’t want her to stay in my home. Should I send a response to the lawyer stating my dad doesn’t live with me full-time? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nI’m also worried for my dad, who is 58 and having knee issues and worsening health not sure what kind of trouble will he be in. \nHow can i help my dad here. I know he did msny mistakes. But he supports me and understand my issues and try to help me as much as possible. \n\nI have no one to approach or ask for help, no relatives would come in for help unless there is a death. ",

Some miscreants edited and leaked explicit pics of my sister. They also sent the images to us for blackmail. They messaged us using anonymous Instagram accounts. \n1. We tried to talk them out of it but they didn't respond positively. \n1. Since my sister was stressed, we were looking after her Insta account. \n1. Around the same time, my sister's old friend who had a new Instagram account also messaged her. We didn't know it was a friend. We thought it was one of the miscreants. Some rude messages were exchanged and then that person (friend) stopped. \n1. We filed an FIR against all the 4 anonymous Insta accounts. \n1. The police got their real names from Meta company. \n1. We also managed to get the names of the account owners from the cops. 2 people who had a quarrel with my sister and 1 old friend (that's how we came to know about the friend's new account). \n1. The friend also got a call from the police and then called us to explain. \n\nSo now, we have a situation where we named an friendly innocent person (along with the real culprits)  in the FIR. \n\nHow can we resolve the situation with minimum trouble to our friend? We don't want the friend to go through the pain of the legal process. ",

I know that i will get a refund but the it was imperative that i had to travel to the aizawl as my returning flight to bengaluru was on the 26th, and i could not miss this.\n\nNow, other than the ticket refund, how can i remake the loss of 18K, i am at the moment broke and in debt to a friend. Is there a way to force the company to payup, all they said was operational difficulties and i have it on record. from my understanding i think they couldn't get a lot of people on the plane to make it worth the cost of service, but that's not my problem.I think this is a unique case as i spoke to some of the staff and they said not many people had any other flights from flying plans from aizawl",

        "selftext": "\n\nI need advice regarding my eligibility for a teaching post and whether I should pursue a court case to claim the position. Here’s my situation:\n\n1. Background:\n\nI applied for a teaching post where the notification mentioned that only candidates with a B.Ed. in Special Education are eligible.\n\nHowever, I knew the qualifications mentioned in the notification were incomplete because, based on past vacancies, candidates with a graduation + special diploma (recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India, RCI) were also eligible.\n\nThe RCI is the only body authorized to decide eligibility criteria for such posts, not the government.\n\n\n\n2. My Qualifications at the Time:\n\nI had a special diploma and was pursuing my graduation. However, my graduation was incomplete at the time of application.\n\nDespite this, I filled out the form, sat for the exam, and scored more than 20 marks above the cutoff (in the 2x result list).\n\n\n\n3. Current Scenario:\n\nI did not attend document verification because I had not completed my graduation by the last date of application, as per the notification’s criteria. , also government was only allowing special bed candidates\n\nMeanwhile, the government sought clarification from the RCI regarding qualifications, and the RCI confirmed that diploma holders (like me) are also valid for the post.\n\nAnd after 6-8 months due to some answers get changed, 2x result was canceled, and a new, fresh result was released today. My roll number is still in this list.\n\n\n\n4. Dilemma:\n\nThe notification clearly stated that all qualifications must be completed by the last date of application, which I did not meet.\n\nHowever, I believe I am eligible for the post based on RCI's clarification and past precedence.\n\nI desperately need this job, and I worked incredibly hard for it.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\nDo I have a strong case if I file a court petition?\n\nWhat legal arguments can I make to strengthen my case?\n\nAre there any past judgments or legal principles that could support my claim?\n\n\nI understand my chances might be slim, but I want to explore all possible options. Your guidance would mean a lot to me.\n\nThank you!\n\n.\n\n",

Unfortunately, all the items had some issue or the other in terms of size and fit so I decided to return it. I raised a request to return the items on 30th Dec and my order was picked up by a Delhivery guy on 31st Dec 2024. The person who picked it up was behaving very strangely. As he went through each item to confirm everything was there with all tags intact, he kept asking me the total value of the order and saying \"Ye order toh kaafi mehenga hoga na madam?\" \nI didn't respond and asked him to verify if it was him who was supposed to pick it up. And he said yes and that it was his first day of work so he is new to all this. I verified his phone number from the Delhivery app and then handed him my entire parcel. I later got an email from Delhivery that day that my order was picked up. \n\nOn 3rd Jan 2025, I received and email from Delhivery that my parcel was returned to Zara warehouse. Usually, when we return items to Zara, we get an email from them confirming that they have received it and the refund will be processed. I kept waiting for that email but didn't get one. I contacted Zara's customer service on 10th Jan 2025 and they told me they had only received one sweater in the parcel and it was a non-Zara item so they will not be giving me a refund. I have been chasing them ever since through calls every other day and their executives keep telling me to wait for 24-48 hours as my case has been expedited. But it's going to be month since I returned all the items. \n\nI have my suspicions that the Delhivery pickup guy stole my parcel and handed them random item. But I have not even been able to reach out to Delhivery since they deactivate their AWBs within 15 days. And their automated customer service says to contact the seller. And Zara has been utterly useless in those terms. \n\nI really need my money back. \n\nIs this worth filing a case in consumer court? How can we do it? Or is there any other way I can get them to give my refund. ",

        "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nThanks in advance for reading this huge wall of text :)\n\nA family member of mine booked a wedding hall/banquet situated in Sec 56 Gurgaon on July 7th 2024. They paid 90000 as a booking amount of the total Rs 3,15,000 (Food and Venue only, no decoration.). \n\nThey had booked the pool side venue, however at the time of booking, the pool was operational for members and functions were not being conducted. The Salesperson told us that we can come in November to look at their poolside functions to finalize our decoration.\n\nFast forward to end of November, we had not heard anything from the sales person, and after following up with her multiple times to give us a time to visit the venue for tasting and to see the decoration, she finally gave us a date of Dec 4th. She had informed us that there would be a wedding function in the eve of 4th Dec where we can see sample decoration and taste the food. \n\nWhen on Dec 4th we reached the venue, it was in an ABYSSMAL condition. It looked like they were taking apart the decoration instead of putting it up. Keep in mind that we went there at 8 pm, and the wedding guests had almost started to arrive. \n\nThe entire venue was covered in used straws and disposable spoons/plates, maybe from the day before function and nobody had bothered cleaning it up. The sofa for the bride and groom was dirty and torn and had food/stains marks all over. The low chairs for the bride and groom during pheras, were dirty, and had holes in them. Without getting into more details, it was a very horrible setup.\n\nNow based on all of this, we decided to confront the sales lady (who had been trying to avoid us the entire time btw), and we told them to cancel the venue. \n\nWe had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. With to and fro with the venue management, we were able to get them to send an email to us stating that they will refund \"the amount that we paid at the time of booking\" and that we can expect the refund in 3rd week of January 2025. \n\nHowever, since passing of 3rd week of Jan 2025, they have stopped responding and keep saying that they will send a final date soon. \n\nTldr: A family member booked a poolside wedding venue in Sec 56, Gurgaon, for July 7, 2024, paying ₹90,000 upfront (total ₹3,15,000). The salesperson promised a visit in November to view decorations and food tasting, but after delays, they finally scheduled it for Dec 4. Upon visiting, the venue was in terrible condition—dirty, torn furniture, and no proper setup despite an ongoing event. The family decided to cancel, however they had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. Upon negotiations, the family got an email confirmation of a refund with the venue management. The venue promised a refund by mid-Jan 2025 but has since stopped responding and delayed giving a final refund date. \n\nWhat legal steps can the family take to recover this amount? \n\n",

It’s going to be little long but he actually needs help so please read\n\nHe met a girl in 2019 they fell in love and started living together later he got to know that she was married but she said they got divorced and he trusted her! Then 6 months into the relationship she was after him to get married within 5-10 days as her mother was sick and there won’t be any auspicious day after 30th of some month i don’t remember. He tried to explain her that marriage doesn’t happen quickly and he doesn’t earn enough to be married and he also want big wedding someday! But she kept forcing him by saying I don’t care about big wedding i want small wedding!\nIt was just after lockdown and they got married in Arya samaj.\n\nAfter 1 year of marriage she started behaving controlling like leave your friends stay home with me all the time! Mind that she was 5-6 years older to him, he didn’t want to leave his friends and wanted to drink occasionally  with his friends but whenever he made plans she threatened him by saying i will jump from the building or i will cut my hand!\n\nBefore this threatening happened, my friend bought a house on his name and made his wife the nominee! But later on he could not take all this and he ran off!\n\nIt’s been 3 years since he has left his own home! She took all the stuff from the house which had some very expensive stuff also! She took property papers too which is in her bank locker! \n\nWhen she didn’t respond to mutual divorce! My friend met a girl and have been living with her and wants to marry her so he decided to talk to an advocate! Now he got to know she was married before but never divorced her first husband! Lawyer told him if my friend wants to marry again he can but he needs to forget about his own house any all the stuff including money in joint account with her!\n\nNow finally his wife filled a complaint saying he tortured her basically 498 or something! And she also included his mother and sister in it when he has been living away from family for past 11 years and she met the family twice only that too for lunch or dinner only!\n\nSo he wants to know that she can take away his home and joint account money? Which is his only asset as his family doesn’t talk to him and have nothing else. And as she is not divorced before so can she still claim everything ?",

        "selftext": "I bought a pair of headphones, Soundcore Q30 Life in October last year, and they've been my daily driver for 3 months. And today suddenly the headband cracks near the earmuff. I looked it up and it seems like it's a relatively common QC issue in this particular model. There's plenty of proof here - [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/wx2opz/the_headband_on_my_q30_headphones_broke_after_a/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/lhcei6/soundcore_q30_design_flaw_the_plastic_clips_next/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/xlvwjj/another_broken_soundcore_q30/) [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/187blhc/soundcore_q30_part_broke/) [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/nv4jhk/my_soundcore_q30_broke_always_felt_right_side_was/)\n\nI contacted Anker regarding the 18 Month Warranty claim since a good few people got a new pair after the brittle plastic headband broke the same way, or at least that's what they claimed on their respective reddit threads. I contacted them via email regarding the same and I was shocked by their reply. They said and I quote - \n\n\"I'm sorry to hear about the damage to your product. Unfortunately, according to our policy, we do not provide a warranty if the product is damaged or lost due to improper use. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.\"\n\nIt's not even due to outside damage or misuse which they mention in their warranty terms, it's literally the cheap quality of plastic used in the headband. Also if it's not covered under the warranty claim, then why replace them for customers outside of India? This is a well known defect and they've very much acknowledged it in the past as well, I am positively mystified at this remark.\n\nIs there something I can do legally to get them to honor this warranty claim? Seems like they've shut down my ticket too.",

The school headmaster had permission to cut only one dead/dried-out tree and this was done by the concerned authorities by following the procedure few days back\n\n\n3.

The son is survived by a wife; will the property now be jointly owned by both the mother and the daughter-in-law?\n\n\t2.\tWhen the property was registered, both the son and the mother were listed as joint owners. However, it was mentioned that the registry included a discount due to the woman’s ownership. Does this imply that the registry is in the mother’s name, and that the property will be transferred solely to her?\n\n\t3.\tIf the property is transferred to the mother’s name, does the daughter-in-law have any rights to it?\n\n\t4.\tIf the mother ultimately receives the property, can she transfer it as a gift to her daughter in order to prevent the daughter-in-law from acquiring any rights to it?\n\nLooking forward to any insights!",

        "selftext": "This post is based on my understanding of the **Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill, 2024**. If there are any mistakes or inaccuracies, please let me know in the comments! I'm happy to learn and discuss. 😊\n\n# Uttarakhand Implements Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in 2024\n\nThe Uttarakhand government has introduced the **Uniform Civil Code (UCC)**, making it the first Indian state to adopt a unified legal framework for all its residents. This law simplifies and regulates matters like **marriage, divorce, inheritance**, and **live-in relationships**, ensuring everyone is treated equally under the same set of laws, regardless of their religion or cultural practices.\n\n# Key Points of the UCC\n\n1. **Marriage Rules:**\n   * Both partners must be **unmarried** at the time of marriage.\n   * Minimum age for marriage: **21 years for men, 18 years for women.**\n   * Marriage between close relatives (prohibited relationships) is not allowed unless permitted by specific customs, and those customs must not go against public policy.\n2. **Polygamy Banned:**\n   * Polygamy is **prohibited for everyone**, including communities where it was previously allowed (e.g., Muslim personal laws).\n   * Only **monogamous marriages** will be legally valid under the UCC.\n3. **Mandatory Marriage Registration:**\n   * Every marriage, even if solemnized outside Uttarakhand, must be registered with the authorities if at least one partner is a resident of the state.\n   * Marriages conducted since **2010** must also be registered retroactively.\n4. **Live-in Relationships:**\n   * Couples in live-in relationships must register their partnership within **30 days** of living together.\n   * **Children born from live-in relationships are considered legitimate** and will have inheritance rights.\n   * Women deserted by live-in partners can claim **financial support (maintenance)** through the courts.\n5. **Equal Inheritance Rights:**\n   * Both sons and daughters are given **equal inheritance rights** to their parents’ property, ensuring gender equality.\n6. **Religious Freedom for Ceremonies:**\n   * Couples can marry following their own religious or customary traditions, such as **Saptapadi, Nikah, Holy Union**, or **Anand Karaj.**\n\n# Who Does It Apply To?\n\n* The UCC applies to **all residents of Uttarakhand**, even those living outside the state.\n* **Scheduled Tribes** and groups with **protected customary practices** under the Constitution are exempt from this Code.\n\n# What Changes Under the UCC?\n\nThe UCC replaces personal laws based on religion with a **common set of rules** for everyone. For example:\n\n* Practices like **polygamy** are no longer allowed.\n* There is now a standardized procedure for marriage, divorce, and property inheritance.\n* Women in both marriages and live-in relationships have clear legal protections.\n\nFINE AND IMPRISONMENT \n\n* Under the Uttarakhand UCC, 2024, failing to submit a live-in relationship statement can result in:\n\nFine: Up to ₹10,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 3 months.\n\nProviding false information or ignoring notices can lead to stricter penalties, including:\n\nFine: Up to ₹25,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 6 months.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI need assistance with a passport issue for my father. The problem is related to a name correction in his passport application. Here’s the situation:\n\n* My father already has a passport, but it expired 5 years ago.\n* He renewed his passport in 2009, and at that time, due to a misunderstanding, his name was recorded incorrectly. Specifically, his grandfather’s name (father's father's name) was included, resulting in a trimmed/abbreviated version of his actual name.\n* Now, his old passport has a name that doesn’t match his Aadhaar card or other documents.\n\nWe recently applied for a passport renewal and visited the Passport Seva Kendra with all the necessary documents for a name correction. However, the officer in charge put the application on hold and insisted that we update the name on his Aadhaar card to match the old passport.\n\nWhile changing the name on the Aadhaar card is possible, it would create a ripple effect, as many other documents (bank accounts, property papers, etc.) are linked to the current name on his Aadhaar. This is the name we prefer to maintain, as it’s consistent across all other documents.\n\nOur goal is to correct the name in the passport to match the Aadhaar card, rather than changing the Aadhaar card to match the old passport. Is there any way to achieve this? Has anyone faced a similar situation or have advice on how to resolve this issue?\n\nAny guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\n",

However, he didn’t say anything about it at first.**\n\n**When my husband found out I’d been hiding messages, he got extremely angry and started getting violent with me. He says he loves me a lot and is possessive, telling me I shouldn’t talk to anyone else. I tried to fight back, saying I want to continue talking to this person, but then my husband told my family about everything, and things got worse. My mom became physically abusive, and my family started saying awful things to me—things I never imagined they’d say.**\n\n**I feel trapped. My family is now threatening to hurt both me and the person I want to stay in touch with if I leave or continue talking to him. I’m staying with my husband for the sake of my kids, even though I feel completely helpless. The person I wanted to talk to is no longer speaking to me, and my family completely hates both me and him now.**\n\n**I’m terrified to even reach out to him, as my husband is tracking my phone and messages and has been threatening me. I honestly don’t know what to do. All are ignoring me and not letting me leave as well. I feel stuck, scared, and like I have no way out. Does anyone have advice on how to navigate this?**",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI need help understanding what to do in this situation.\n\nThere was a building located on in Kattakada, Thiruvananthapuram, that was severely damaged in a fire in May 2024. It’s in an unsafe condition, with structural instability, burnt debris, and residual oil spills. Despite this, the previous tenant is trying to resume operations there, posing serious risks to public safety.\n\nHere’s what has happened so far:\n\n1. A grievance was filed with the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office, and the issue was forwarded to the District Joint Director (LSGD) and then to the Panchayat.\n\n1. The Panchayat’s investigation report merely stated that “the building is partially ruined” without addressing concerns like structural instability or chemical hazards. No actions have been taken so far.\n\n1. The grievance was closed by the Joint Director's office without verifying if the Panchayat's response addressed the concerns or if any appropriate action was taken.\n\n1. When approached, the Panchayat, the officials said that the Panchayat isn’t responsible for stopping businesses from operating in unsafe premises, but they didn’t clarify which authority is.\n\nI’m not sure what to do next. I’ve contacted multiple authorities, but no action has been taken so far.\n\nMy questions:\n\n* Which authority is responsible for preventing businesses from operating in unsafe buildings in Kerala?\n\n* Should this be escalated to any higher authority?\n\n* Is there any foul play happening? Is that the reason no authority is taking any action?\n\n* How can I ensure that this matter is taken seriously and that action is initiated?\n\nI will attach photos of the burnt building for reference. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!\n\n ",

Apparently, the person who rented my car used it to smuggle a huge quantity of alcohol. Since the smuggler wasn’t caught during the incident, they charged me—the car owner—as an accused.\n\nThe lawyer told me I need to:\n\nGo to Bihar to get bail for my name.\nFile cases in the civil court, DM court, and then the high court to get my car back.\n\nThey also said Zoomcar cannot help me further.\nI hired a lawyer to handle this, but after 9 months, there has been no progress. This situation has taken a massive toll on my mental health. My family, work, and studies are all suffering, and I’m experiencing severe anxiety and depression because of this ordeal.\n\nI feel completely helpless and stuck. Has anyone faced a similar issue or can guide me on what to do next? Are there any legal steps I can take against Zoomcar for their negligence or lack of support?\n\nAny advice or suggestions would mean the world to me. Thank you in advance!\n",

A few months later, during the demonetization period, my father repaid my aunt ₹10 lakh, which she deposited back into her account at that time.\n\nFast forward a few years, and after missing some notices sent to my aunt, the Income Tax Department has now imposed a fine of nearly ₹13 lakh on the transaction. Under the DTVSV Scheme, they’re asking us to settle the case by paying around ₹9 lakh (which includes unofficial \"bribes\").\n\nWe’re stuck deciding between two options:\na) Pay the amount and move on with a peaceful life.\nb) Hire a good lawyer or CA, which could cost around ₹3 lakh (with no guarantee of winning), and fight the case to prove the legitimacy of the transaction.\n\nI’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts or advice. What would be the wisest course of action in this situation?\n\nEDIT: \n*The withdrawal and deposit is all within a span of 6 months.\n\n*The source of fund are from her pension funds which can be shown in the statements.",

I’ve marked the old wire line with ----. Now, our neighbor also wants to shift the poles to the end of their land along the highway. The last two poles are on our land, forming a straight line perpendicular to the road.\n\nThey are saying it won’t be possible without our cooperation (but I know that even if we don’t shift our pole, which is already on our land away from the highway, the second pole near the highway is in the right place). We can't refuse outright because we live in a village and are expected to cooperate.\n\nThe issue is the total cost. The electricity department has quoted around **₹3.5 lakhs** for the shift. They say we will get an official receipt from the government. Since the poles are on the land of three families (including ours), our share of the cost would be around **₹1.2 lakhs**.\n\nI want to understand the process for this:\n\n1. Can they charge this much?\n2. Is it true that the electricity department installs new poles when shifting old ones?\n\n**Other info:**\n\n* **State**: Uk\n* Why shift - We currently have no problem with the poles being on our land since the area is used for farming. However, some neighbors have built buildings nearby, so they are the ones who want this shift.\n* The poles don’t supply electricity to the village (not sure), but I think they are primarily for factories using high-voltage lines.",

        "selftext": "We are a Muslim family from Maharashtra, and I am sharing my sister’s painful story. She was married in 2020 through an arranged marriage. The groom’s family seemed educated but turned out to be extremely controlling and orthodox. From the very first day, my sister faced mental and physical abuse.\n\nHere’s what she went through:\n\n1. **No Freedom from Day One:** On the first day after her wedding, her in-laws took away her phone and sent it back to us. When she asked her husband, he told her that daughters-in-law in their house are not allowed to have phones and she should use his phone instead. To avoid arguments, my sister gave up her phone and her connection to the outside world.\n2. **Total Control Over Her Life:** Her in-laws controlled everything—what she wore, who she talked to, what she ate, even how and when she laughed.\n3. **No Respect in Her Marriage:** Her husband ignored her completely. He spent most of his time with a girl named \"Gudiya,\" who lived with the family but wasn’t related to them. Shockingly, they even shared my sister’s bed while she was forced to sleep on the floor. He avoided talking to her and came home late at night to avoid any confrontation.\n4. **Her Career Dreams Crushed:** My sister is highly qualified (MA in Geography and B.Ed) and wanted to become a professor. Her husband was also a teacher before their marriage, so we thought he would support her dreams. But after marriage, she found out he had quit his job because his mother told him to. When she tried to prepare for exams like NET/SET, her sister-in-law created drama and stopped her from studying.\n5. **No Healthcare or Basic Dignity:** If she fell sick, she was mocked for being weak. They refused to take her to the doctor unless her condition was serious.\n6. **Gold and Dowry Demands:** Her in-laws constantly praised their elder daughter-in-law for bringing dowry and gold every month. They took all the gold my sister brought with her and kept it in a bank without her consent.\n\nShe silently endured this abuse for two years before finally telling us everything. We immediately filed a domestic violence case against her in-laws and husband.\n\n**Legal Struggles**\n\nSince filing the case, her in-laws have avoided every court hearing by manipulating the police and the system. Over a year has passed, and they haven’t attended a single hearing. Meanwhile, my sister has to go to every hearing, reliving her trauma.\n\nEven when a non-bailable warrant was issued, they managed to escape. Their lawyer even got permission for them to skip court appearances. The judge handling the case seems hesitant to take any action, leaving my sister stuck.\n\nTo make things worse, during this time, her husband secretly married another woman without my sister’s consent. While he lives happily, my sister is left to deal with endless legal battles and mental pain.\n\nWe once thought of settling the matter out of court to get her a divorce, but her in-laws refused. They want to “set an example” for other daughters-in-law, showing what happens if they speak out.\n\n**We are desperate for help.** All we want is for my sister to get a divorce and move on with her life.\n\n**Questions We Need Help With:**\n\n1. How can we speed up the court process and make sure her in-laws and husband are held responsible?\n2. What legal steps can we take to secure a divorce and protect her future?\n3. How do we fight the manipulation of the police and courts by her in-laws?\n4. Can stricter action be taken against her husband for marrying another woman without her consent?\n\nPlease help us. My sister deserves a chance to live her life with dignity and hope.",

However, I still treated her like a queen. I completely lived for her and my daughter.\n\nLately, her abusive episodes have started lasting longer and longer. It's broken me. I can't imagine this ending in any way other than divorce. Whether it's next week or 5 years from now, it will happen.\n\nQuestion: How do I keep myself prepared. I know I can contact a divorce lawyer, but what about other things like removing her as the beneficiary from my investments, how do I handle my daughter's schooling, what about all the documents where she is mentioned as my wife. Would a divorce lawyer help me with these?\n\nIn case it matters, we are Muslims. No official marriage certificate but there's a nikahnama and her name is on my passport.",

One of the second generation hier is educated while the rest are not(let’s call him and his kin A and the rest XYZ). This has caused a lot of issues over the years which I will summarise in points. Please feel free to give any info about individual points as well. \n\n1) So A is the only one in possession of the original will and all other survey papers (at least claims to be) and with his he is always encroaching everyone’s property by stating that XYZ have built houses outside the boundaries. \n\nI figure I can get the survey results through a legal process, but the will and other documents, is there a legal process to request him to share all documents that he claims to be the sources with others?\n\n2) A and XYZ agreed to give the said property to a builder for development purposes in 2001. There was some advance money paid out by the builder and there was no development started by the developer in a long time. Since XYZ had no employment, they took out several more advances throughout the years from the said builder, now 20 years later, there is still no development and even though we’re willing to pay the money back (even with interest) the developer isn’t make any progress. \n\nWhat can we do in this situation? \n\nThis has been going on since I was a kid and now I earn quite well and I want to help my dad using some money I can spend. It’s been really hard to see him struggle with his relatives. Any input or suggestions of legal teams are welcome! Thank you for taking the time to read!  ",

        "selftext": "Hi,   \n  \nI want to know certain things. I have been living in rent in a property managed by The Helloworld Coliving in Mumbai. I am facing a fundamental necessity issue, which is drinking water, for which they were supposed to put up a water purifier on the property. They provide water that the property's caretaker refills from another property, and a 20ltr can be used for five people. I have faced multiple issues, such as   \n1. Refilling the water from my friend's place.   \n2. No water available in the middle of the night  \n3. The caretaker not being available to get water, which I have to purchase from Blinkit  \n  \nI had raised multiple complaints with their support team, but they closed the ticket without providing an update or getting a customer response. Their customer service number is provided on the website. I called multiple times, but no one answered the calls. Sometimes, someone responded, but they lack basic essentialnication and accountability. \n\nThe biggest culprit is the property manager; I am sure he has never visited the property. He does most of his work via phone like a mafia boss. Most of the time, he has made false promises and no accountability. Whenever an issue is raised in a call, he gives vague timelines like \"it will be done\". And the biggest irony is that there is only one property manager for the entire location. The support team mainly contacts the property manager to resolve tickets. IItis like a Ponzi scheme where the issue goes completely unheard. I am paying 30k as rent for one single room; I mean, there is a TV, a F#\\*\\*ING TV in the amenities, which is entirely useless but no Water Purifier. The management should be pretty dumb and lame to come up with this.\n\n  \nNow the reason I am facing eviction is I have already mentioned to the support team on email that I will be withholding my rent payment until my issue is fixed which they don't seem to care about as they closed those support tickets which I have raised saying the issue has been fixed but in ground reality nothing's been done. I am clear that when I signed the agreement Water Purifer was part of the amenities that they were supposed to provide. What should I do in this case?",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI need some legal advice regarding a complicated situation.\n\nBackground: I come from a lower-income family. My mother left me immediately when I was born due to psychiatric issues and has lived with her parents for over 25 years. Dad tried applying for divorce, but with no address, no answer or response, he didn't get the divorce. I grew up with my father’s parents, who passed away in 2018.\n\nAfter 15+ years of waiting, My dad (58) found a live-in partner in 2010 who agreed to live without divorce or marriage initially.. She (40) a divorcee with two kids from her first marriage. She didn't tell anything and all lies about her first husband being drunkard and so on. \nThings went downhill quickly with her living in my home— within 1 month my grandparents started losing things, theft, bad behavior, and targeting on property. Whenever dad is at home she acts like an angel with me and grandparents.\n\nGrandparents kicked her out within 1 month and my dad and she have lived separately since 2012 in a rented home.\n\nI am disabled and 90% deaf, and I live in the house my grandparents built in Bangalore. My dad visits daily to help me out with household chores.\n\nIn 2015, dad discovered she had an affair in her first marriage that led to her divorce. Even with dad she had affairs late night talks and dad once caught a guy in home when she was alone. She just brushed it off saying friends. \n\nIn 2017, she had lung cancer, which she made my dad financially supported for operation and recovery.\n\nIn 2018, she had medical treatment to conceive again and ended up having a child without my dad’s decision as well. We don't even know if the kid belongs to dad. She hid this news until the 6th month.\n\nIn 2021, they had a violent fight, leading to police involvement. She took the child and ran to Kerala. She’s using the child to emotionally blackmail dad and has sent legal notices to my address claiming dowry and demanding to live in my home. Despite her issues, people seem to side with her. She tried to barge into my home and dad tried to push her out, leading to my name being included in an FIR.\n\nNow, in 2025, a similar fight happened in their rental home and police were called again.\n\nShe’s sending more legal notices through lawyers in Kerala and demands my dad appear before the Kerala Vanitha Committee on a date. \nThis notice came through my home address and dad unknowingly signed and took the letter, later he was regretting he should not have taken in my home address. \n\nThe latest issue is that she wants to live in my home, as my dad has no income.\nAnd she wants dad to marry her in order to see the child or to be in peace, else she would work on creating issues. \n\nMy dad has a small 1BHK near Electronic City around agricultural land, but she refuses to live there and insists on coming to my home.\n\nShe is also trying to involve me in all this and I suspect she'll again try to enter my home forcefully to live in.\n\nI’m already struggling with my disability unable to work effectively, lost my future, and finances aspects, and now the added legal fees and headache are difficult to pay. \n\nMy home is still in my grandparents' name, and I need to settle a amount as per will with my dad's sister to own it in my name which i am yet to do. \n\nWhat can I legally do to stop her from sending these notices and pulling me into this mess?\nCan i send a return notice to not disturb me and my dad does not stay here in my home? \n\nI don’t want her to stay in my home. Should I send a response to the lawyer stating my dad doesn’t live with me full-time? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nI’m also worried for my dad, who is 58 and having knee issues and worsening health not sure what kind of trouble will he be in. \nHow can i help my dad here. I know he did msny mistakes. But he supports me and understand my issues and try to help me as much as possible. \n\nI have no one to approach or ask for help, no relatives would come in for help unless there is a death. ",

Around the same time, my sister's old friend who had a new Instagram account also messaged her. We didn't know it was a friend. We thought it was one of the miscreants. Some rude messages were exchanged and then that person (friend) stopped. \n1. We filed an FIR against all the 4 anonymous Insta accounts. \n1. The police got their real names from Meta company. \n1. We also managed to get the names of the account owners from the cops. 2 people who had a quarrel with my sister and 1 old friend (that's how we came to know about the friend's new account). \n1.

Background:\n\nI applied for a teaching post where the notification mentioned that only candidates with a B.Ed. in Special Education are eligible.\n\nHowever, I knew the qualifications mentioned in the notification were incomplete because, based on past vacancies, candidates with a graduation + special diploma (recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India, RCI) were also eligible.\n\nThe RCI is the only body authorized to decide eligibility criteria for such posts, not the government.\n\n\n\n2. My Qualifications at the Time:\n\nI had a special diploma and was pursuing my graduation.

Current Scenario:\n\nI did not attend document verification because I had not completed my graduation by the last date of application, as per the notification’s criteria. , also government was only allowing special bed candidates\n\nMeanwhile, the government sought clarification from the RCI regarding qualifications, and the RCI confirmed that diploma holders (like me) are also valid for the post.\n\nAnd after 6-8 months due to some answers get changed, 2x result was canceled, and a new, fresh result was released today. My roll number is still in this list.\n\n\n\n4.

Unfortunately, all the items had some issue or the other in terms of size and fit so I decided to return it. I raised a request to return the items on 30th Dec and my order was picked up by a Delhivery guy on 31st Dec 2024. The person who picked it up was behaving very strangely. As he went through each item to confirm everything was there with all tags intact, he kept asking me the total value of the order and saying \"Ye order toh kaafi mehenga hoga na madam?\" \nI didn't respond and asked him to verify if it was him who was supposed to pick it up. And he said yes and that it was his first day of work so he is new to all this. I verified his phone number from the Delhivery app and then handed him my entire parcel. I later got an email from Delhivery that day that my order was picked up. \n\nOn 3rd Jan 2025, I received and email from Delhivery that my parcel was returned to Zara warehouse. Usually, when we return items to Zara, we get an email from them confirming that they have received it and the refund will be processed. I kept waiting for that email but didn't get one. I contacted Zara's customer service on 10th Jan 2025 and they told me they had only received one sweater in the parcel and it was a non-Zara item so they will not be giving me a refund. I have been chasing them ever since through calls every other day and their executives keep telling me to wait for 24-48 hours as my case has been expedited. But it's going to be month since I returned all the items. \n\nI have my suspicions that the Delhivery pickup guy stole my parcel and handed them random item. But I have not even been able to reach out to Delhivery since they deactivate their AWBs within 15 days. And their automated customer service says to contact the seller. And Zara has been utterly useless in those terms. \n\nI really need my money back. \n\nIs this worth filing a case in consumer court? How can we do it? Or is there any other way I can get them to give my refund. ",

        "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nThanks in advance for reading this huge wall of text :)\n\nA family member of mine booked a wedding hall/banquet situated in Sec 56 Gurgaon on July 7th 2024. They paid 90000 as a booking amount of the total Rs 3,15,000 (Food and Venue only, no decoration.). \n\nThey had booked the pool side venue, however at the time of booking, the pool was operational for members and functions were not being conducted. The Salesperson told us that we can come in November to look at their poolside functions to finalize our decoration.\n\nFast forward to end of November, we had not heard anything from the sales person, and after following up with her multiple times to give us a time to visit the venue for tasting and to see the decoration, she finally gave us a date of Dec 4th. She had informed us that there would be a wedding function in the eve of 4th Dec where we can see sample decoration and taste the food. \n\nWhen on Dec 4th we reached the venue, it was in an ABYSSMAL condition. It looked like they were taking apart the decoration instead of putting it up. Keep in mind that we went there at 8 pm, and the wedding guests had almost started to arrive. \n\nThe entire venue was covered in used straws and disposable spoons/plates, maybe from the day before function and nobody had bothered cleaning it up. The sofa for the bride and groom was dirty and torn and had food/stains marks all over. The low chairs for the bride and groom during pheras, were dirty, and had holes in them. Without getting into more details, it was a very horrible setup.\n\nNow based on all of this, we decided to confront the sales lady (who had been trying to avoid us the entire time btw), and we told them to cancel the venue. \n\nWe had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. With to and fro with the venue management, we were able to get them to send an email to us stating that they will refund \"the amount that we paid at the time of booking\" and that we can expect the refund in 3rd week of January 2025. \n\nHowever, since passing of 3rd week of Jan 2025, they have stopped responding and keep saying that they will send a final date soon. \n\nTldr: A family member booked a poolside wedding venue in Sec 56, Gurgaon, for July 7, 2024, paying ₹90,000 upfront (total ₹3,15,000). The salesperson promised a visit in November to view decorations and food tasting, but after delays, they finally scheduled it for Dec 4. Upon visiting, the venue was in terrible condition—dirty, torn furniture, and no proper setup despite an ongoing event. The family decided to cancel, however they had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. Upon negotiations, the family got an email confirmation of a refund with the venue management. The venue promised a refund by mid-Jan 2025 but has since stopped responding and delayed giving a final refund date. \n\nWhat legal steps can the family take to recover this amount? \n\n",

It’s going to be little long but he actually needs help so please read\n\nHe met a girl in 2019 they fell in love and started living together later he got to know that she was married but she said they got divorced and he trusted her! Then 6 months into the relationship she was after him to get married within 5-10 days as her mother was sick and there won’t be any auspicious day after 30th of some month i don’t remember. He tried to explain her that marriage doesn’t happen quickly and he doesn’t earn enough to be married and he also want big wedding someday! But she kept forcing him by saying I don’t care about big wedding i want small wedding!\nIt was just after lockdown and they got married in Arya samaj.\n\nAfter 1 year of marriage she started behaving controlling like leave your friends stay home with me all the time! Mind that she was 5-6 years older to him, he didn’t want to leave his friends and wanted to drink occasionally  with his friends but whenever he made plans she threatened him by saying i will jump from the building or i will cut my hand!\n\nBefore this threatening happened, my friend bought a house on his name and made his wife the nominee! But later on he could not take all this and he ran off!\n\nIt’s been 3 years since he has left his own home! She took all the stuff from the house which had some very expensive stuff also! She took property papers too which is in her bank locker! \n\nWhen she didn’t respond to mutual divorce! My friend met a girl and have been living with her and wants to marry her so he decided to talk to an advocate! Now he got to know she was married before but never divorced her first husband! Lawyer told him if my friend wants to marry again he can but he needs to forget about his own house any all the stuff including money in joint account with her!\n\nNow finally his wife filled a complaint saying he tortured her basically 498 or something! And she also included his mother and sister in it when he has been living away from family for past 11 years and she met the family twice only that too for lunch or dinner only!\n\nSo he wants to know that she can take away his home and joint account money? Which is his only asset as his family doesn’t talk to him and have nothing else. And as she is not divorced before so can she still claim everything ?",

There's plenty of proof here - [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/wx2opz/the_headband_on_my_q30_headphones_broke_after_a/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/lhcei6/soundcore_q30_design_flaw_the_plastic_clips_next/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/xlvwjj/another_broken_soundcore_q30/) [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/187blhc/soundcore_q30_part_broke/) [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/nv4jhk/my_soundcore_q30_broke_always_felt_right_side_was/)\n\nI contacted Anker regarding the 18 Month Warranty claim since a good few people got a new pair after the brittle plastic headband broke the same way, or at least that's what they claimed on their respective reddit threads. I contacted them via email regarding the same and I was shocked by their reply. They said and I quote - \n\n\"I'm sorry to hear about the damage to your product. Unfortunately, according to our policy, we do not provide a warranty if the product is damaged or lost due to improper use. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.\"\n\nIt's not even due to outside damage or misuse which they mention in their warranty terms, it's literally the cheap quality of plastic used in the headband. Also if it's not covered under the warranty claim, then why replace them for customers outside of India? This is a well known defect and they've very much acknowledged it in the past as well, I am positively mystified at this remark.\n\nIs there something I can do legally to get them to honor this warranty claim? Seems like they've shut down my ticket too.",

Grandma is still alive and apparently grandpa didn’t leave anything for her or us according to uncle. He just showed us the first page of the document and has stopped responding to the entire family and is refusing to show the entire gift deed/ will. \n\nFor context, my dad supported my grandpa financially when he was alive and looked after his medical expenses/ insurance. But their relationship grew distant in the past few years, chiefly due to grandpa’s orthodox mindset.\n\nLawyer is telling us to find out exact date of registration of gift deed but we have no idea as the witness was paid off by uncle. Any suggestions how to proceed? Gift deed was signed in a tier 3 city and my family is in a separate megacity so travel will have to be planned properly. ",

        "selftext": "Context:\n\nMy mother is a Physical Education teacher at a government school in Bengaluru.\n\nAfter the Republic Day celebrations, she visited her school in the evening to take down and fold the national flag.\n\n\nWhat Happened:\n\n1. She discovered that massive, decades-old trees on the school campus had been cut down.\n\n\n2. The school headmaster had permission to cut only one dead/dried-out tree and this was done by the concerned authorities by following the procedure few days back\n\n\n3. But yesterday (26/1/25) me and my mom saw that the headmaster has illegally cut two healthy trees without proper authorization (she wasn't present at the sight) and we have a video evidence of the man admitting that the headmaster has payed him to cut.\n\n\n4. The wood from these trees is very valuable and is intended for personal profit.\n\n\n5. As per procedure, tree-felling requires permission from BBMP or the Karnataka Forest Department, who also handle the cutting and removal process. This wasn’t followed.\n\n\n6. My mother recorded videos of the site as evidence and is considering filing a complaint.\n\n\n\nMy Concerns:\n\nIf my mother or I escalate this (e.g., filing a complaint or posting on Twitter), could we face any legal trouble or retaliation from the school/headmaster?\n\nIs there any other legal procedure or body we should approach to address this?\n\n\nKey Questions for Advice:\n\n1. What are the potential legal risks for us if we take this forward?\n\n\n2. What steps should we take to ensure this is handled legally and safely?\n\n\n3. Is there any way to ensure anonymity for my mother while filing the complaint? I'm planning to post this on X(twitter) since benguluru police are active there from what I know ",

The son is survived by a wife; will the property now be jointly owned by both the mother and the daughter-in-law?\n\n\t2.\tWhen the property was registered, both the son and the mother were listed as joint owners. However, it was mentioned that the registry included a discount due to the woman’s ownership. Does this imply that the registry is in the mother’s name, and that the property will be transferred solely to her?\n\n\t3.\tIf the property is transferred to the mother’s name, does the daughter-in-law have any rights to it?\n\n\t4.\tIf the mother ultimately receives the property, can she transfer it as a gift to her daughter in order to prevent the daughter-in-law from acquiring any rights to it?\n\nLooking forward to any insights!",

        "selftext": "I had booked a bus ticket for two through redBus for a journey from Ahmedabad to Pune on January 27th for a whopping inflated price of ₹7000 (due to coldplay concert). The original departure time was 8:05 PM. However, on the same day of travel, at 10:17 AM, I received an email from the bus operator stating that the bus had been rescheduled and preponed to 6:05 PM.\n\nThere was no way I could have made it 2 hours earlier than what I had initially planned because I was travelling from Porbandar. When I contacted the bus operator, they could only offer an alternate bus for the next day, which was not a feasible option for me. \n\nI reached out to redBus support for help. The redBus team suggested that I book another ticket on my own while they escalated the issue for a refund, asking me to wait 48 hours for a resolution. However, within just 1 hour of filing the complaint, they marked it as ‘Resolved’ and denied the refund. They claimed that the bus operator provided a “reasonable” solution to me. They didn’t even mention what was the “reasonable” solution provided.\n\nSince then, I’ve been going back and forth with redBus support but haven’t received any resolution.\n\nAny advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.",

So the latest agreement is over a month old.\n\nHowever, the landlord in question has not been paying the society maintenance charges for a year now. In addition, a couple of days ago, I also received a Property Tax Demand (Rs. 16K or so) from the BMC meaning he hasn't been paying that either. I have been forwarding these to him over WhatsApp.\n\nThe society office is on my side, and are asking me not to pay the rent for the next month (I planned to pay it as per schedule on Feb 5). They say this will put adequate pressure on him to turn up and clear their bill. Should I proceed with not paying?\n\nAlso, I don't want to deal with this headache anyway - can I just take the hit on my security deposit and walk away, no questions asked? The security deposit is worth approx 3 months of rent. The agreement has a clause saying there is a lock-in period of 6 months, but it also states in another part that the landlord is responsible for paying all the bills. \n\nWhat should I do?",

        "selftext": "This post is based on my understanding of the **Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill, 2024**. If there are any mistakes or inaccuracies, please let me know in the comments! I'm happy to learn and discuss. 😊\n\n# Uttarakhand Implements Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in 2024\n\nThe Uttarakhand government has introduced the **Uniform Civil Code (UCC)**, making it the first Indian state to adopt a unified legal framework for all its residents. This law simplifies and regulates matters like **marriage, divorce, inheritance**, and **live-in relationships**, ensuring everyone is treated equally under the same set of laws, regardless of their religion or cultural practices.\n\n# Key Points of the UCC\n\n1. **Marriage Rules:**\n   * Both partners must be **unmarried** at the time of marriage.\n   * Minimum age for marriage: **21 years for men, 18 years for women.**\n   * Marriage between close relatives (prohibited relationships) is not allowed unless permitted by specific customs, and those customs must not go against public policy.\n2. **Polygamy Banned:**\n   * Polygamy is **prohibited for everyone**, including communities where it was previously allowed (e.g., Muslim personal laws).\n   * Only **monogamous marriages** will be legally valid under the UCC.\n3. **Mandatory Marriage Registration:**\n   * Every marriage, even if solemnized outside Uttarakhand, must be registered with the authorities if at least one partner is a resident of the state.\n   * Marriages conducted since **2010** must also be registered retroactively.\n4. **Live-in Relationships:**\n   * Couples in live-in relationships must register their partnership within **30 days** of living together.\n   * **Children born from live-in relationships are considered legitimate** and will have inheritance rights.\n   * Women deserted by live-in partners can claim **financial support (maintenance)** through the courts.\n5. **Equal Inheritance Rights:**\n   * Both sons and daughters are given **equal inheritance rights** to their parents’ property, ensuring gender equality.\n6. **Religious Freedom for Ceremonies:**\n   * Couples can marry following their own religious or customary traditions, such as **Saptapadi, Nikah, Holy Union**, or **Anand Karaj.**\n\n# Who Does It Apply To?\n\n* The UCC applies to **all residents of Uttarakhand**, even those living outside the state.\n* **Scheduled Tribes** and groups with **protected customary practices** under the Constitution are exempt from this Code.\n\n# What Changes Under the UCC?\n\nThe UCC replaces personal laws based on religion with a **common set of rules** for everyone. For example:\n\n* Practices like **polygamy** are no longer allowed.\n* There is now a standardized procedure for marriage, divorce, and property inheritance.\n* Women in both marriages and live-in relationships have clear legal protections.\n\nFINE AND IMPRISONMENT \n\n* Under the Uttarakhand UCC, 2024, failing to submit a live-in relationship statement can result in:\n\nFine: Up to ₹10,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 3 months.\n\nProviding false information or ignoring notices can lead to stricter penalties, including:\n\nFine: Up to ₹25,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 6 months.",

Here’s the situation:\n\n* My father already has a passport, but it expired 5 years ago.\n* He renewed his passport in 2009, and at that time, due to a misunderstanding, his name was recorded incorrectly. Specifically, his grandfather’s name (father's father's name) was included, resulting in a trimmed/abbreviated version of his actual name.\n* Now, his old passport has a name that doesn’t match his Aadhaar card or other documents.\n\nWe recently applied for a passport renewal and visited the Passport Seva Kendra with all the necessary documents for a name correction. However, the officer in charge put the application on hold and insisted that we update the name on his Aadhaar card to match the old passport.\n\nWhile changing the name on the Aadhaar card is possible, it would create a ripple effect, as many other documents (bank accounts, property papers, etc.) are linked to the current name on his Aadhaar. This is the name we prefer to maintain, as it’s consistent across all other documents.\n\nOur goal is to correct the name in the passport to match the Aadhaar card, rather than changing the Aadhaar card to match the old passport. Is there any way to achieve this? Has anyone faced a similar situation or have advice on how to resolve this issue?\n\nAny guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

He says he loves me a lot and is possessive, telling me I shouldn’t talk to anyone else. I tried to fight back, saying I want to continue talking to this person, but then my husband told my family about everything, and things got worse. My mom became physically abusive, and my family started saying awful things to me—things I never imagined they’d say.**\n\n**I feel trapped. My family is now threatening to hurt both me and the person I want to stay in touch with if I leave or continue talking to him.

It’s in an unsafe condition, with structural instability, burnt debris, and residual oil spills. Despite this, the previous tenant is trying to resume operations there, posing serious risks to public safety.\n\nHere’s what has happened so far:\n\n1. A grievance was filed with the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office, and the issue was forwarded to the District Joint Director (LSGD) and then to the Panchayat.\n\n1. The Panchayat’s investigation report merely stated that “the building is partially ruined” without addressing concerns like structural instability or chemical hazards. No actions have been taken so far.\n\n1. The grievance was closed by the Joint Director's office without verifying if the Panchayat's response addressed the concerns or if any appropriate action was taken.\n\n1. When approached, the Panchayat, the officials said that the Panchayat isn’t responsible for stopping businesses from operating in unsafe premises, but they didn’t clarify which authority is.\n\nI’m not sure what to do next. I’ve contacted multiple authorities, but no action has been taken so far.\n\nMy questions:\n\n* Which authority is responsible for preventing businesses from operating in unsafe buildings in Kerala?\n\n* Should this be escalated to any higher authority?\n\n* Is there any foul play happening? Is that the reason no authority is taking any action?\n\n* How can I ensure that this matter is taken seriously and that action is initiated?\n\nI will attach photos of the burnt building for reference. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!\n\n ",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m in a very distressing situation and could really use some advice. Last year, I rented my car on Zoomcar from May 30th to June 2nd. Since then, I have not gotten my car back. It’s been almost 9 months, and dealing with Zoomcar has been a nightmare.\n\nAfter repeated attempts to get in touch, their lawyer finally called me and informed me that my car has been impounded by the Bihar police. Apparently, the person who rented my car used it to smuggle a huge quantity of alcohol. Since the smuggler wasn’t caught during the incident, they charged me—the car owner—as an accused.\n\nThe lawyer told me I need to:\n\nGo to Bihar to get bail for my name.\nFile cases in the civil court, DM court, and then the high court to get my car back.\n\nThey also said Zoomcar cannot help me further.\nI hired a lawyer to handle this, but after 9 months, there has been no progress. This situation has taken a massive toll on my mental health. My family, work, and studies are all suffering, and I’m experiencing severe anxiety and depression because of this ordeal.\n\nI feel completely helpless and stuck. Has anyone faced a similar issue or can guide me on what to do next? Are there any legal steps I can take against Zoomcar for their negligence or lack of support?\n\nAny advice or suggestions would mean the world to me. Thank you in advance!\n",

I’ve marked the old wire line with ----. Now, our neighbor also wants to shift the poles to the end of their land along the highway. The last two poles are on our land, forming a straight line perpendicular to the road.\n\nThey are saying it won’t be possible without our cooperation (but I know that even if we don’t shift our pole, which is already on our land away from the highway, the second pole near the highway is in the right place). We can't refuse outright because we live in a village and are expected to cooperate.\n\nThe issue is the total cost. The electricity department has quoted around **₹3.5 lakhs** for the shift. They say we will get an official receipt from the government. Since the poles are on the land of three families (including ours), our share of the cost would be around **₹1.2 lakhs**.\n\nI want to understand the process for this:\n\n1. Can they charge this much?\n2. Is it true that the electricity department installs new poles when shifting old ones?\n\n**Other info:**\n\n* **State**: Uk\n* Why shift - We currently have no problem with the poles being on our land since the area is used for farming. However, some neighbors have built buildings nearby, so they are the ones who want this shift.\n* The poles don’t supply electricity to the village (not sure), but I think they are primarily for factories using high-voltage lines.",

The groom’s family seemed educated but turned out to be extremely controlling and orthodox.

He spent most of his time with a girl named \"Gudiya,\" who lived with the family but wasn’t related to them. Shockingly, they even shared my sister’s bed while she was forced to sleep on the floor. He avoided talking to her and came home late at night to avoid any confrontation.\n4. **Her Career Dreams Crushed:** My sister is highly qualified (MA in Geography and B.Ed) and wanted to become a professor. Her husband was also a teacher before their marriage, so we thought he would support her dreams. But after marriage, she found out he had quit his job because his mother told him to. When she tried to prepare for exams like NET/SET, her sister-in-law created drama and stopped her from studying.\n5. **No Healthcare or Basic Dignity:** If she fell sick, she was mocked for being weak. They refused to take her to the doctor unless her condition was serious.\n6. **Gold and Dowry Demands:** Her in-laws constantly praised their elder daughter-in-law for bringing dowry and gold every month. They took all the gold my sister brought with her and kept it in a bank without her consent.\n\nShe silently endured this abuse for two years before finally telling us everything. We immediately filed a domestic violence case against her in-laws and husband.\n\n**Legal Struggles**\n\nSince filing the case, her in-laws have avoided every court hearing by manipulating the police and the system. Over a year has passed, and they haven’t attended a single hearing. Meanwhile, my sister has to go to every hearing, reliving her trauma.\n\nEven when a non-bailable warrant was issued, they managed to escape. Their lawyer even got permission for them to skip court appearances. The judge handling the case seems hesitant to take any action, leaving my sister stuck.\n\nTo make things worse, during this time, her husband secretly married another woman without my sister’s consent. While he lives happily, my sister is left to deal with endless legal battles and mental pain.\n\nWe once thought of settling the matter out of court to get her a divorce, but her in-laws refused. They want to “set an example” for other daughters-in-law, showing what happens if they speak out.\n\n**We are desperate for help.** All we want is for my sister to get a divorce and move on with her life.\n\n**Questions We Need Help With:**\n\n1. How can we speed up the court process and make sure her in-laws and husband are held responsible?\n2. What legal steps can we take to secure a divorce and protect her future?\n3. How do we fight the manipulation of the police and courts by her in-laws?\n4. Can stricter action be taken against her husband for marrying another woman without her consent?\n\nPlease help us. My sister deserves a chance to live her life with dignity and hope.",

I met the ARO, and he said he would do the work after coming for inspection and the remaining 3 offices.

I confirmed with him today if he submitted and paid the fees in total. He said yes.\n\nBecause of this delay, we are unable to sell the office. In such a situation, does the buyer have a right to cancel the purchase although the property has been registered? Also, two companies refused to rent the office because we didn't have a khata.",

Please feel free to give any info about individual points as well. \n\n1) So A is the only one in possession of the original will and all other survey papers (at least claims to be) and with his he is always encroaching everyone’s property by stating that XYZ have built houses outside the boundaries. \n\nI figure I can get the survey results through a legal process, but the will and other documents, is there a legal process to request him to share all documents that he claims to be the sources with others?\n\n2) A and XYZ agreed to give the said property to a builder for development purposes in 2001. There was some advance money paid out by the builder and there was no development started by the developer in a long time. Since XYZ had no employment, they took out several more advances throughout the years from the said builder, now 20 years later, there is still no development and even though we’re willing to pay the money back (even with interest) the developer isn’t make any progress. \n\nWhat can we do in this situation? \n\nThis has been going on since I was a kid and now I earn quite well and I want to help my dad using some money I can spend. It’s been really hard to see him struggle with his relatives. Any input or suggestions of legal teams are welcome! Thank you for taking the time to read!  ",

        "selftext": "Hi,   \n  \nI want to know certain things. I have been living in rent in a property managed by The Helloworld Coliving in Mumbai. I am facing a fundamental necessity issue, which is drinking water, for which they were supposed to put up a water purifier on the property. They provide water that the property's caretaker refills from another property, and a 20ltr can be used for five people. I have faced multiple issues, such as   \n1. Refilling the water from my friend's place.   \n2. No water available in the middle of the night  \n3. The caretaker not being available to get water, which I have to purchase from Blinkit  \n  \nI had raised multiple complaints with their support team, but they closed the ticket without providing an update or getting a customer response. Their customer service number is provided on the website. I called multiple times, but no one answered the calls. Sometimes, someone responded, but they lack basic essentialnication and accountability. \n\nThe biggest culprit is the property manager; I am sure he has never visited the property. He does most of his work via phone like a mafia boss. Most of the time, he has made false promises and no accountability. Whenever an issue is raised in a call, he gives vague timelines like \"it will be done\". And the biggest irony is that there is only one property manager for the entire location. The support team mainly contacts the property manager to resolve tickets. IItis like a Ponzi scheme where the issue goes completely unheard. I am paying 30k as rent for one single room; I mean, there is a TV, a F#\\*\\*ING TV in the amenities, which is entirely useless but no Water Purifier. The management should be pretty dumb and lame to come up with this.\n\n  \nNow the reason I am facing eviction is I have already mentioned to the support team on email that I will be withholding my rent payment until my issue is fixed which they don't seem to care about as they closed those support tickets which I have raised saying the issue has been fixed but in ground reality nothing's been done. I am clear that when I signed the agreement Water Purifer was part of the amenities that they were supposed to provide. What should I do in this case?",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI need some legal advice regarding a complicated situation.\n\nBackground: I come from a lower-income family. My mother left me immediately when I was born due to psychiatric issues and has lived with her parents for over 25 years. Dad tried applying for divorce, but with no address, no answer or response, he didn't get the divorce. I grew up with my father’s parents, who passed away in 2018.\n\nAfter 15+ years of waiting, My dad (58) found a live-in partner in 2010 who agreed to live without divorce or marriage initially.. She (40) a divorcee with two kids from her first marriage. She didn't tell anything and all lies about her first husband being drunkard and so on. \nThings went downhill quickly with her living in my home— within 1 month my grandparents started losing things, theft, bad behavior, and targeting on property. Whenever dad is at home she acts like an angel with me and grandparents.\n\nGrandparents kicked her out within 1 month and my dad and she have lived separately since 2012 in a rented home.\n\nI am disabled and 90% deaf, and I live in the house my grandparents built in Bangalore. My dad visits daily to help me out with household chores.\n\nIn 2015, dad discovered she had an affair in her first marriage that led to her divorce. Even with dad she had affairs late night talks and dad once caught a guy in home when she was alone. She just brushed it off saying friends. \n\nIn 2017, she had lung cancer, which she made my dad financially supported for operation and recovery.\n\nIn 2018, she had medical treatment to conceive again and ended up having a child without my dad’s decision as well. We don't even know if the kid belongs to dad. She hid this news until the 6th month.\n\nIn 2021, they had a violent fight, leading to police involvement. She took the child and ran to Kerala. She’s using the child to emotionally blackmail dad and has sent legal notices to my address claiming dowry and demanding to live in my home. Despite her issues, people seem to side with her. She tried to barge into my home and dad tried to push her out, leading to my name being included in an FIR.\n\nNow, in 2025, a similar fight happened in their rental home and police were called again.\n\nShe’s sending more legal notices through lawyers in Kerala and demands my dad appear before the Kerala Vanitha Committee on a date. \nThis notice came through my home address and dad unknowingly signed and took the letter, later he was regretting he should not have taken in my home address. \n\nThe latest issue is that she wants to live in my home, as my dad has no income.\nAnd she wants dad to marry her in order to see the child or to be in peace, else she would work on creating issues. \n\nMy dad has a small 1BHK near Electronic City around agricultural land, but she refuses to live there and insists on coming to my home.\n\nShe is also trying to involve me in all this and I suspect she'll again try to enter my home forcefully to live in.\n\nI’m already struggling with my disability unable to work effectively, lost my future, and finances aspects, and now the added legal fees and headache are difficult to pay. \n\nMy home is still in my grandparents' name, and I need to settle a amount as per will with my dad's sister to own it in my name which i am yet to do. \n\nWhat can I legally do to stop her from sending these notices and pulling me into this mess?\nCan i send a return notice to not disturb me and my dad does not stay here in my home? \n\nI don’t want her to stay in my home. Should I send a response to the lawyer stating my dad doesn’t live with me full-time? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nI’m also worried for my dad, who is 58 and having knee issues and worsening health not sure what kind of trouble will he be in. \nHow can i help my dad here. I know he did msny mistakes. But he supports me and understand my issues and try to help me as much as possible. \n\nI have no one to approach or ask for help, no relatives would come in for help unless there is a death. ",

I know that i will get a refund but the it was imperative that i had to travel to the aizawl as my returning flight to bengaluru was on the 26th, and i could not miss this.\n\nNow, other than the ticket refund, how can i remake the loss of 18K, i am at the moment broke and in debt to a friend. Is there a way to force the company to payup, all they said was operational difficulties and i have it on record. from my understanding i think they couldn't get a lot of people on the plane to make it worth the cost of service, but that's not my problem.I think this is a unique case as i spoke to some of the staff and they said not many people had any other flights from flying plans from aizawl",

        "selftext": "\n\nI need advice regarding my eligibility for a teaching post and whether I should pursue a court case to claim the position. Here’s my situation:\n\n1. Background:\n\nI applied for a teaching post where the notification mentioned that only candidates with a B.Ed. in Special Education are eligible.\n\nHowever, I knew the qualifications mentioned in the notification were incomplete because, based on past vacancies, candidates with a graduation + special diploma (recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India, RCI) were also eligible.\n\nThe RCI is the only body authorized to decide eligibility criteria for such posts, not the government.\n\n\n\n2. My Qualifications at the Time:\n\nI had a special diploma and was pursuing my graduation. However, my graduation was incomplete at the time of application.\n\nDespite this, I filled out the form, sat for the exam, and scored more than 20 marks above the cutoff (in the 2x result list).\n\n\n\n3. Current Scenario:\n\nI did not attend document verification because I had not completed my graduation by the last date of application, as per the notification’s criteria. , also government was only allowing special bed candidates\n\nMeanwhile, the government sought clarification from the RCI regarding qualifications, and the RCI confirmed that diploma holders (like me) are also valid for the post.\n\nAnd after 6-8 months due to some answers get changed, 2x result was canceled, and a new, fresh result was released today. My roll number is still in this list.\n\n\n\n4. Dilemma:\n\nThe notification clearly stated that all qualifications must be completed by the last date of application, which I did not meet.\n\nHowever, I believe I am eligible for the post based on RCI's clarification and past precedence.\n\nI desperately need this job, and I worked incredibly hard for it.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\nDo I have a strong case if I file a court petition?\n\nWhat legal arguments can I make to strengthen my case?\n\nAre there any past judgments or legal principles that could support my claim?\n\n\nI understand my chances might be slim, but I want to explore all possible options. Your guidance would mean a lot to me.\n\nThank you!\n\n.\n\n",

Unfortunately, all the items had some issue or the other in terms of size and fit so I decided to return it. I raised a request to return the items on 30th Dec and my order was picked up by a Delhivery guy on 31st Dec 2024. The person who picked it up was behaving very strangely. As he went through each item to confirm everything was there with all tags intact, he kept asking me the total value of the order and saying \"Ye order toh kaafi mehenga hoga na madam?\" \nI didn't respond and asked him to verify if it was him who was supposed to pick it up. And he said yes and that it was his first day of work so he is new to all this. I verified his phone number from the Delhivery app and then handed him my entire parcel. I later got an email from Delhivery that day that my order was picked up. \n\nOn 3rd Jan 2025, I received and email from Delhivery that my parcel was returned to Zara warehouse. Usually, when we return items to Zara, we get an email from them confirming that they have received it and the refund will be processed. I kept waiting for that email but didn't get one. I contacted Zara's customer service on 10th Jan 2025 and they told me they had only received one sweater in the parcel and it was a non-Zara item so they will not be giving me a refund. I have been chasing them ever since through calls every other day and their executives keep telling me to wait for 24-48 hours as my case has been expedited. But it's going to be month since I returned all the items. \n\nI have my suspicions that the Delhivery pickup guy stole my parcel and handed them random item. But I have not even been able to reach out to Delhivery since they deactivate their AWBs within 15 days. And their automated customer service says to contact the seller. And Zara has been utterly useless in those terms. \n\nI really need my money back. \n\nIs this worth filing a case in consumer court? How can we do it? Or is there any other way I can get them to give my refund. ",

        "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nThanks in advance for reading this huge wall of text :)\n\nA family member of mine booked a wedding hall/banquet situated in Sec 56 Gurgaon on July 7th 2024. They paid 90000 as a booking amount of the total Rs 3,15,000 (Food and Venue only, no decoration.). \n\nThey had booked the pool side venue, however at the time of booking, the pool was operational for members and functions were not being conducted. The Salesperson told us that we can come in November to look at their poolside functions to finalize our decoration.\n\nFast forward to end of November, we had not heard anything from the sales person, and after following up with her multiple times to give us a time to visit the venue for tasting and to see the decoration, she finally gave us a date of Dec 4th. She had informed us that there would be a wedding function in the eve of 4th Dec where we can see sample decoration and taste the food. \n\nWhen on Dec 4th we reached the venue, it was in an ABYSSMAL condition. It looked like they were taking apart the decoration instead of putting it up. Keep in mind that we went there at 8 pm, and the wedding guests had almost started to arrive. \n\nThe entire venue was covered in used straws and disposable spoons/plates, maybe from the day before function and nobody had bothered cleaning it up. The sofa for the bride and groom was dirty and torn and had food/stains marks all over. The low chairs for the bride and groom during pheras, were dirty, and had holes in them. Without getting into more details, it was a very horrible setup.\n\nNow based on all of this, we decided to confront the sales lady (who had been trying to avoid us the entire time btw), and we told them to cancel the venue. \n\nWe had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. With to and fro with the venue management, we were able to get them to send an email to us stating that they will refund \"the amount that we paid at the time of booking\" and that we can expect the refund in 3rd week of January 2025. \n\nHowever, since passing of 3rd week of Jan 2025, they have stopped responding and keep saying that they will send a final date soon. \n\nTldr: A family member booked a poolside wedding venue in Sec 56, Gurgaon, for July 7, 2024, paying ₹90,000 upfront (total ₹3,15,000). The salesperson promised a visit in November to view decorations and food tasting, but after delays, they finally scheduled it for Dec 4. Upon visiting, the venue was in terrible condition—dirty, torn furniture, and no proper setup despite an ongoing event. The family decided to cancel, however they had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. Upon negotiations, the family got an email confirmation of a refund with the venue management. The venue promised a refund by mid-Jan 2025 but has since stopped responding and delayed giving a final refund date. \n\nWhat legal steps can the family take to recover this amount? \n\n",

It’s going to be little long but he actually needs help so please read\n\nHe met a girl in 2019 they fell in love and started living together later he got to know that she was married but she said they got divorced and he trusted her! Then 6 months into the relationship she was after him to get married within 5-10 days as her mother was sick and there won’t be any auspicious day after 30th of some month i don’t remember. He tried to explain her that marriage doesn’t happen quickly and he doesn’t earn enough to be married and he also want big wedding someday! But she kept forcing him by saying I don’t care about big wedding i want small wedding!\nIt was just after lockdown and they got married in Arya samaj.\n\nAfter 1 year of marriage she started behaving controlling like leave your friends stay home with me all the time! Mind that she was 5-6 years older to him, he didn’t want to leave his friends and wanted to drink occasionally  with his friends but whenever he made plans she threatened him by saying i will jump from the building or i will cut my hand!\n\nBefore this threatening happened, my friend bought a house on his name and made his wife the nominee! But later on he could not take all this and he ran off!\n\nIt’s been 3 years since he has left his own home! She took all the stuff from the house which had some very expensive stuff also! She took property papers too which is in her bank locker! \n\nWhen she didn’t respond to mutual divorce! My friend met a girl and have been living with her and wants to marry her so he decided to talk to an advocate! Now he got to know she was married before but never divorced her first husband! Lawyer told him if my friend wants to marry again he can but he needs to forget about his own house any all the stuff including money in joint account with her!\n\nNow finally his wife filled a complaint saying he tortured her basically 498 or something! And she also included his mother and sister in it when he has been living away from family for past 11 years and she met the family twice only that too for lunch or dinner only!\n\nSo he wants to know that she can take away his home and joint account money? Which is his only asset as his family doesn’t talk to him and have nothing else. And as she is not divorced before so can she still claim everything ?",

I contacted them via email regarding the same and I was shocked by their reply. They said and I quote - \n\n\"I'm sorry to hear about the damage to your product. Unfortunately, according to our policy, we do not provide a warranty if the product is damaged or lost due to improper use. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.\"\n\nIt's not even due to outside damage or misuse which they mention in their warranty terms, it's literally the cheap quality of plastic used in the headband. Also if it's not covered under the warranty claim, then why replace them for customers outside of India? This is a well known defect and they've very much acknowledged it in the past as well, I am positively mystified at this remark.\n\nIs there something I can do legally to get them to honor this warranty claim?

She discovered that massive, decades-old trees on the school campus had been cut down.\n\n\n2. The school headmaster had permission to cut only one dead/dried-out tree and this was done by the concerned authorities by following the procedure few days back\n\n\n3. But yesterday (26/1/25) me and my mom saw that the headmaster has illegally cut two healthy trees without proper authorization (she wasn't present at the sight) and we have a video evidence of the man admitting that the headmaster has payed him to cut.\n\n\n4. The wood from these trees is very valuable and is intended for personal profit.\n\n\n5. As per procedure, tree-felling requires permission from BBMP or the Karnataka Forest Department, who also handle the cutting and removal process. This wasn’t followed.\n\n\n6. My mother recorded videos of the site as evidence and is considering filing a complaint.\n\n\n\nMy Concerns:\n\nIf my mother or I escalate this (e.g., filing a complaint or posting on Twitter), could we face any legal trouble or retaliation from the school/headmaster?\n\nIs there any other legal procedure or body we should approach to address this?\n\n\nKey Questions for Advice:\n\n1. What are the potential legal risks for us if we take this forward?\n\n\n2. What steps should we take to ensure this is handled legally and safely?\n\n\n3. Is there any way to ensure anonymity for my mother while filing the complaint? I'm planning to post this on X(twitter) since benguluru police are active there from what I know ",

I'm happy to learn and discuss. 😊\n\n# Uttarakhand Implements Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in 2024\n\nThe Uttarakhand government has introduced the **Uniform Civil Code (UCC)**, making it the first Indian state to adopt a unified legal framework for all its residents. This law simplifies and regulates matters like **marriage, divorce, inheritance**, and **live-in relationships**, ensuring everyone is treated equally under the same set of laws, regardless of their religion or cultural practices.\n\n# Key Points of the UCC\n\n1. **Marriage Rules:**\n   * Both partners must be **unmarried** at the time of marriage.\n   * Minimum age for marriage: **21 years for men, 18 years for women.**\n   * Marriage between close relatives (prohibited relationships) is not allowed unless permitted by specific customs, and those customs must not go against public policy.\n2. **Polygamy Banned:**\n   * Polygamy is **prohibited for everyone**, including communities where it was previously allowed (e.g., Muslim personal laws).\n   * Only **monogamous marriages** will be legally valid under the UCC.\n3. **Mandatory Marriage Registration:**\n   * Every marriage, even if solemnized outside Uttarakhand, must be registered with the authorities if at least one partner is a resident of the state.\n   * Marriages conducted since **2010** must also be registered retroactively.\n4. **Live-in Relationships:**\n   * Couples in live-in relationships must register their partnership within **30 days** of living together.\n   * **Children born from live-in relationships are considered legitimate** and will have inheritance rights.\n   * Women deserted by live-in partners can claim **financial support (maintenance)** through the courts.\n5. **Equal Inheritance Rights:**\n   * Both sons and daughters are given **equal inheritance rights** to their parents’ property, ensuring gender equality.\n6. **Religious Freedom for Ceremonies:**\n   * Couples can marry following their own religious or customary traditions, such as **Saptapadi, Nikah, Holy Union**, or **Anand Karaj.**\n\n# Who Does It Apply To?\n\n* The UCC applies to **all residents of Uttarakhand**, even those living outside the state.\n* **Scheduled Tribes** and groups with **protected customary practices** under the Constitution are exempt from this Code.\n\n# What Changes Under the UCC?\n\nThe UCC replaces personal laws based on religion with a **common set of rules** for everyone. For example:\n\n* Practices like **polygamy** are no longer allowed.\n* There is now a standardized procedure for marriage, divorce, and property inheritance.\n* Women in both marriages and live-in relationships have clear legal protections.\n\nFINE AND IMPRISONMENT \n\n* Under the Uttarakhand UCC, 2024, failing to submit a live-in relationship statement can result in:\n\nFine: Up to ₹10,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 3 months.\n\nProviding false information or ignoring notices can lead to stricter penalties, including:\n\nFine: Up to ₹25,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 6 months.",

Here’s the situation:\n\n* My father already has a passport, but it expired 5 years ago.\n* He renewed his passport in 2009, and at that time, due to a misunderstanding, his name was recorded incorrectly. Specifically, his grandfather’s name (father's father's name) was included, resulting in a trimmed/abbreviated version of his actual name.\n* Now, his old passport has a name that doesn’t match his Aadhaar card or other documents.\n\nWe recently applied for a passport renewal and visited the Passport Seva Kendra with all the necessary documents for a name correction. However, the officer in charge put the application on hold and insisted that we update the name on his Aadhaar card to match the old passport.\n\nWhile changing the name on the Aadhaar card is possible, it would create a ripple effect, as many other documents (bank accounts, property papers, etc.) are linked to the current name on his Aadhaar. This is the name we prefer to maintain, as it’s consistent across all other documents.\n\nOur goal is to correct the name in the passport to match the Aadhaar card, rather than changing the Aadhaar card to match the old passport. Is there any way to achieve this? Has anyone faced a similar situation or have advice on how to resolve this issue?\n\nAny guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

My mom became physically abusive, and my family started saying awful things to me—things I never imagined they’d say.**\n\n**I feel trapped. My family is now threatening to hurt both me and the person I want to stay in touch with if I leave or continue talking to him.

It’s in an unsafe condition, with structural instability, burnt debris, and residual oil spills. Despite this, the previous tenant is trying to resume operations there, posing serious risks to public safety.\n\nHere’s what has happened so far:\n\n1. A grievance was filed with the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office, and the issue was forwarded to the District Joint Director (LSGD) and then to the Panchayat.\n\n1. The Panchayat’s investigation report merely stated that “the building is partially ruined” without addressing concerns like structural instability or chemical hazards. No actions have been taken so far.\n\n1. The grievance was closed by the Joint Director's office without verifying if the Panchayat's response addressed the concerns or if any appropriate action was taken.\n\n1. When approached, the Panchayat, the officials said that the Panchayat isn’t responsible for stopping businesses from operating in unsafe premises, but they didn’t clarify which authority is.\n\nI’m not sure what to do next. I’ve contacted multiple authorities, but no action has been taken so far.\n\nMy questions:\n\n* Which authority is responsible for preventing businesses from operating in unsafe buildings in Kerala?\n\n* Should this be escalated to any higher authority?\n\n* Is there any foul play happening? Is that the reason no authority is taking any action?\n\n* How can I ensure that this matter is taken seriously and that action is initiated?\n\nI will attach photos of the burnt building for reference. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!\n\n ",

Since then, I have not gotten my car back. It’s been almost 9 months, and dealing with Zoomcar has been a nightmare.\n\nAfter repeated attempts to get in touch, their lawyer finally called me and informed me that my car has been impounded by the Bihar police. Apparently, the person who rented my car used it to smuggle a huge quantity of alcohol. Since the smuggler wasn’t caught during the incident, they charged me—the car owner—as an accused.\n\nThe lawyer told me I need to:\n\nGo to Bihar to get bail for my name.\nFile cases in the civil court, DM court, and then the high court to get my car back.\n\nThey also said Zoomcar cannot help me further.\nI hired a lawyer to handle this, but after 9 months, there has been no progress. This situation has taken a massive toll on my mental health. My family, work, and studies are all suffering, and I’m experiencing severe anxiety and depression because of this ordeal.\n\nI feel completely helpless and stuck. Has anyone faced a similar issue or can guide me on what to do next? Are there any legal steps I can take against Zoomcar for their negligence or lack of support?\n\nAny advice or suggestions would mean the world to me. Thank you in advance!\n",

I’ve marked the old wire line with ----. Now, our neighbor also wants to shift the poles to the end of their land along the highway. The last two poles are on our land, forming a straight line perpendicular to the road.\n\nThey are saying it won’t be possible without our cooperation (but I know that even if we don’t shift our pole, which is already on our land away from the highway, the second pole near the highway is in the right place). We can't refuse outright because we live in a village and are expected to cooperate.\n\nThe issue is the total cost. The electricity department has quoted around **₹3.5 lakhs** for the shift. They say we will get an official receipt from the government. Since the poles are on the land of three families (including ours), our share of the cost would be around **₹1.2 lakhs**.\n\nI want to understand the process for this:\n\n1. Can they charge this much?\n2. Is it true that the electricity department installs new poles when shifting old ones?\n\n**Other info:**\n\n* **State**: Uk\n* Why shift - We currently have no problem with the poles being on our land since the area is used for farming. However, some neighbors have built buildings nearby, so they are the ones who want this shift.\n* The poles don’t supply electricity to the village (not sure), but I think they are primarily for factories using high-voltage lines.",

TREES THAT DID NOT EVEN HAVE ANY BRANCHES TOUCHING OR NEAR THE WIRES HAVE BEEN CUT DOWN. \nI spoke to the people cutting it down and they said that some was for the MCF work, but the society families have also come and requested them to cut extra without telling anyone. \n\nWhat can I do here? \n\nIt's painful to see. It's so incredibly wrong. 20+ years of strong, beautiful, lush green trees just cut down. These stupid men and women don't realise that these very trees provided shade in summers, which are increasingly unbearable each year. \n\nI want to slap some legal on the society management so that they know things dont go without consequences. Please help in case anyone has an idea. Thanks a lot in advance. ",

        "selftext": "We are a Muslim family from Maharashtra, and I am sharing my sister’s painful story. She was married in 2020 through an arranged marriage. The groom’s family seemed educated but turned out to be extremely controlling and orthodox. From the very first day, my sister faced mental and physical abuse.\n\nHere’s what she went through:\n\n1. **No Freedom from Day One:** On the first day after her wedding, her in-laws took away her phone and sent it back to us. When she asked her husband, he told her that daughters-in-law in their house are not allowed to have phones and she should use his phone instead. To avoid arguments, my sister gave up her phone and her connection to the outside world.\n2. **Total Control Over Her Life:** Her in-laws controlled everything—what she wore, who she talked to, what she ate, even how and when she laughed.\n3. **No Respect in Her Marriage:** Her husband ignored her completely. He spent most of his time with a girl named \"Gudiya,\" who lived with the family but wasn’t related to them. Shockingly, they even shared my sister’s bed while she was forced to sleep on the floor. He avoided talking to her and came home late at night to avoid any confrontation.\n4. **Her Career Dreams Crushed:** My sister is highly qualified (MA in Geography and B.Ed) and wanted to become a professor. Her husband was also a teacher before their marriage, so we thought he would support her dreams. But after marriage, she found out he had quit his job because his mother told him to. When she tried to prepare for exams like NET/SET, her sister-in-law created drama and stopped her from studying.\n5. **No Healthcare or Basic Dignity:** If she fell sick, she was mocked for being weak. They refused to take her to the doctor unless her condition was serious.\n6. **Gold and Dowry Demands:** Her in-laws constantly praised their elder daughter-in-law for bringing dowry and gold every month. They took all the gold my sister brought with her and kept it in a bank without her consent.\n\nShe silently endured this abuse for two years before finally telling us everything. We immediately filed a domestic violence case against her in-laws and husband.\n\n**Legal Struggles**\n\nSince filing the case, her in-laws have avoided every court hearing by manipulating the police and the system. Over a year has passed, and they haven’t attended a single hearing. Meanwhile, my sister has to go to every hearing, reliving her trauma.\n\nEven when a non-bailable warrant was issued, they managed to escape. Their lawyer even got permission for them to skip court appearances. The judge handling the case seems hesitant to take any action, leaving my sister stuck.\n\nTo make things worse, during this time, her husband secretly married another woman without my sister’s consent. While he lives happily, my sister is left to deal with endless legal battles and mental pain.\n\nWe once thought of settling the matter out of court to get her a divorce, but her in-laws refused. They want to “set an example” for other daughters-in-law, showing what happens if they speak out.\n\n**We are desperate for help.** All we want is for my sister to get a divorce and move on with her life.\n\n**Questions We Need Help With:**\n\n1. How can we speed up the court process and make sure her in-laws and husband are held responsible?\n2. What legal steps can we take to secure a divorce and protect her future?\n3. How do we fight the manipulation of the police and courts by her in-laws?\n4. Can stricter action be taken against her husband for marrying another woman without her consent?\n\nPlease help us. My sister deserves a chance to live her life with dignity and hope.",

There was some advance money paid out by the builder and there was no development started by the developer in a long time.

I am facing a fundamental necessity issue, which is drinking water, for which they were supposed to put up a water purifier on the property. They provide water that the property's caretaker refills from another property, and a 20ltr can be used for five people. I have faced multiple issues, such as   \n1. Refilling the water from my friend's place.   \n2. No water available in the middle of the night  \n3. The caretaker not being available to get water, which I have to purchase from Blinkit  \n  \nI had raised multiple complaints with their support team, but they closed the ticket without providing an update or getting a customer response. Their customer service number is provided on the website. I called multiple times, but no one answered the calls. Sometimes, someone responded, but they lack basic essentialnication and accountability. \n\nThe biggest culprit is the property manager; I am sure he has never visited the property. He does most of his work via phone like a mafia boss. Most of the time, he has made false promises and no accountability. Whenever an issue is raised in a call, he gives vague timelines like \"it will be done\". And the biggest irony is that there is only one property manager for the entire location. The support team mainly contacts the property manager to resolve tickets. IItis like a Ponzi scheme where the issue goes completely unheard. I am paying 30k as rent for one single room; I mean, there is a TV, a F#\\*\\*ING TV in the amenities, which is entirely useless but no Water Purifier. The management should be pretty dumb and lame to come up with this.\n\n  \nNow the reason I am facing eviction is I have already mentioned to the support team on email that I will be withholding my rent payment until my issue is fixed which they don't seem to care about as they closed those support tickets which I have raised saying the issue has been fixed but in ground reality nothing's been done. I am clear that when I signed the agreement Water Purifer was part of the amenities that they were supposed to provide. What should I do in this case?",

She didn't tell anything and all lies about her first husband being drunkard and so on. \nThings went downhill quickly with her living in my home— within 1 month my grandparents started losing things, theft, bad behavior, and targeting on property. Whenever dad is at home she acts like an angel with me and grandparents.\n\nGrandparents kicked her out within 1 month and my dad and she have lived separately since 2012 in a rented home.\n\nI am disabled and 90% deaf, and I live in the house my grandparents built in Bangalore. My dad visits daily to help me out with household chores.\n\nIn 2015, dad discovered she had an affair in her first marriage that led to her divorce. Even with dad she had affairs late night talks and dad once caught a guy in home when she was alone. She just brushed it off saying friends. \n\nIn 2017, she had lung cancer, which she made my dad financially supported for operation and recovery.\n\nIn 2018, she had medical treatment to conceive again and ended up having a child without my dad’s decision as well. We don't even know if the kid belongs to dad. She hid this news until the 6th month.\n\nIn 2021, they had a violent fight, leading to police involvement. She took the child and ran to Kerala. She’s using the child to emotionally blackmail dad and has sent legal notices to my address claiming dowry and demanding to live in my home. Despite her issues, people seem to side with her. She tried to barge into my home and dad tried to push her out, leading to my name being included in an FIR.\n\nNow, in 2025, a similar fight happened in their rental home and police were called again.\n\nShe’s sending more legal notices through lawyers in Kerala and demands my dad appear before the Kerala Vanitha Committee on a date. \nThis notice came through my home address and dad unknowingly signed and took the letter, later he was regretting he should not have taken in my home address. \n\nThe latest issue is that she wants to live in my home, as my dad has no income.\nAnd she wants dad to marry her in order to see the child or to be in peace, else she would work on creating issues. \n\nMy dad has a small 1BHK near Electronic City around agricultural land, but she refuses to live there and insists on coming to my home.\n\nShe is also trying to involve me in all this and I suspect she'll again try to enter my home forcefully to live in.\n\nI’m already struggling with my disability unable to work effectively, lost my future, and finances aspects, and now the added legal fees and headache are difficult to pay. \n\nMy home is still in my grandparents' name, and I need to settle a amount as per will with my dad's sister to own it in my name which i am yet to do. \n\nWhat can I legally do to stop her from sending these notices and pulling me into this mess?\nCan i send a return notice to not disturb me and my dad does not stay here in my home? \n\nI don’t want her to stay in my home. Should I send a response to the lawyer stating my dad doesn’t live with me full-time? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nI’m also worried for my dad, who is 58 and having knee issues and worsening health not sure what kind of trouble will he be in. \nHow can i help my dad here. I know he did msny mistakes. But he supports me and understand my issues and try to help me as much as possible. \n\nI have no one to approach or ask for help, no relatives would come in for help unless there is a death. ",

Some miscreants edited and leaked explicit pics of my sister. They also sent the images to us for blackmail. They messaged us using anonymous Instagram accounts. \n1. We tried to talk them out of it but they didn't respond positively. \n1. Since my sister was stressed, we were looking after her Insta account. \n1. Around the same time, my sister's old friend who had a new Instagram account also messaged her. We didn't know it was a friend. We thought it was one of the miscreants. Some rude messages were exchanged and then that person (friend) stopped. \n1. We filed an FIR against all the 4 anonymous Insta accounts. \n1. The police got their real names from Meta company. \n1. We also managed to get the names of the account owners from the cops. 2 people who had a quarrel with my sister and 1 old friend (that's how we came to know about the friend's new account). \n1. The friend also got a call from the police and then called us to explain. \n\nSo now, we have a situation where we named an friendly innocent person (along with the real culprits)  in the FIR. \n\nHow can we resolve the situation with minimum trouble to our friend? We don't want the friend to go through the pain of the legal process. ",

        "selftext": "\n\nI need advice regarding my eligibility for a teaching post and whether I should pursue a court case to claim the position. Here’s my situation:\n\n1. Background:\n\nI applied for a teaching post where the notification mentioned that only candidates with a B.Ed. in Special Education are eligible.\n\nHowever, I knew the qualifications mentioned in the notification were incomplete because, based on past vacancies, candidates with a graduation + special diploma (recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India, RCI) were also eligible.\n\nThe RCI is the only body authorized to decide eligibility criteria for such posts, not the government.\n\n\n\n2. My Qualifications at the Time:\n\nI had a special diploma and was pursuing my graduation. However, my graduation was incomplete at the time of application.\n\nDespite this, I filled out the form, sat for the exam, and scored more than 20 marks above the cutoff (in the 2x result list).\n\n\n\n3. Current Scenario:\n\nI did not attend document verification because I had not completed my graduation by the last date of application, as per the notification’s criteria. , also government was only allowing special bed candidates\n\nMeanwhile, the government sought clarification from the RCI regarding qualifications, and the RCI confirmed that diploma holders (like me) are also valid for the post.\n\nAnd after 6-8 months due to some answers get changed, 2x result was canceled, and a new, fresh result was released today. My roll number is still in this list.\n\n\n\n4. Dilemma:\n\nThe notification clearly stated that all qualifications must be completed by the last date of application, which I did not meet.\n\nHowever, I believe I am eligible for the post based on RCI's clarification and past precedence.\n\nI desperately need this job, and I worked incredibly hard for it.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\nDo I have a strong case if I file a court petition?\n\nWhat legal arguments can I make to strengthen my case?\n\nAre there any past judgments or legal principles that could support my claim?\n\n\nI understand my chances might be slim, but I want to explore all possible options. Your guidance would mean a lot to me.\n\nThank you!\n\n.\n\n",

Unfortunately, all the items had some issue or the other in terms of size and fit so I decided to return it. I raised a request to return the items on 30th Dec and my order was picked up by a Delhivery guy on 31st Dec 2024. The person who picked it up was behaving very strangely. As he went through each item to confirm everything was there with all tags intact, he kept asking me the total value of the order and saying \"Ye order toh kaafi mehenga hoga na madam?\" \nI didn't respond and asked him to verify if it was him who was supposed to pick it up. And he said yes and that it was his first day of work so he is new to all this. I verified his phone number from the Delhivery app and then handed him my entire parcel. I later got an email from Delhivery that day that my order was picked up. \n\nOn 3rd Jan 2025, I received and email from Delhivery that my parcel was returned to Zara warehouse. Usually, when we return items to Zara, we get an email from them confirming that they have received it and the refund will be processed. I kept waiting for that email but didn't get one. I contacted Zara's customer service on 10th Jan 2025 and they told me they had only received one sweater in the parcel and it was a non-Zara item so they will not be giving me a refund. I have been chasing them ever since through calls every other day and their executives keep telling me to wait for 24-48 hours as my case has been expedited. But it's going to be month since I returned all the items. \n\nI have my suspicions that the Delhivery pickup guy stole my parcel and handed them random item. But I have not even been able to reach out to Delhivery since they deactivate their AWBs within 15 days. And their automated customer service says to contact the seller. And Zara has been utterly useless in those terms. \n\nI really need my money back. \n\nIs this worth filing a case in consumer court? How can we do it? Or is there any other way I can get them to give my refund. ",

        "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nThanks in advance for reading this huge wall of text :)\n\nA family member of mine booked a wedding hall/banquet situated in Sec 56 Gurgaon on July 7th 2024. They paid 90000 as a booking amount of the total Rs 3,15,000 (Food and Venue only, no decoration.). \n\nThey had booked the pool side venue, however at the time of booking, the pool was operational for members and functions were not being conducted. The Salesperson told us that we can come in November to look at their poolside functions to finalize our decoration.\n\nFast forward to end of November, we had not heard anything from the sales person, and after following up with her multiple times to give us a time to visit the venue for tasting and to see the decoration, she finally gave us a date of Dec 4th. She had informed us that there would be a wedding function in the eve of 4th Dec where we can see sample decoration and taste the food. \n\nWhen on Dec 4th we reached the venue, it was in an ABYSSMAL condition. It looked like they were taking apart the decoration instead of putting it up. Keep in mind that we went there at 8 pm, and the wedding guests had almost started to arrive. \n\nThe entire venue was covered in used straws and disposable spoons/plates, maybe from the day before function and nobody had bothered cleaning it up. The sofa for the bride and groom was dirty and torn and had food/stains marks all over. The low chairs for the bride and groom during pheras, were dirty, and had holes in them. Without getting into more details, it was a very horrible setup.\n\nNow based on all of this, we decided to confront the sales lady (who had been trying to avoid us the entire time btw), and we told them to cancel the venue. \n\nWe had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. With to and fro with the venue management, we were able to get them to send an email to us stating that they will refund \"the amount that we paid at the time of booking\" and that we can expect the refund in 3rd week of January 2025. \n\nHowever, since passing of 3rd week of Jan 2025, they have stopped responding and keep saying that they will send a final date soon. \n\nTldr: A family member booked a poolside wedding venue in Sec 56, Gurgaon, for July 7, 2024, paying ₹90,000 upfront (total ₹3,15,000). The salesperson promised a visit in November to view decorations and food tasting, but after delays, they finally scheduled it for Dec 4. Upon visiting, the venue was in terrible condition—dirty, torn furniture, and no proper setup despite an ongoing event. The family decided to cancel, however they had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. Upon negotiations, the family got an email confirmation of a refund with the venue management. The venue promised a refund by mid-Jan 2025 but has since stopped responding and delayed giving a final refund date. \n\nWhat legal steps can the family take to recover this amount? \n\n",

It’s going to be little long but he actually needs help so please read\n\nHe met a girl in 2019 they fell in love and started living together later he got to know that she was married but she said they got divorced and he trusted her! Then 6 months into the relationship she was after him to get married within 5-10 days as her mother was sick and there won’t be any auspicious day after 30th of some month i don’t remember. He tried to explain her that marriage doesn’t happen quickly and he doesn’t earn enough to be married and he also want big wedding someday! But she kept forcing him by saying I don’t care about big wedding i want small wedding!\nIt was just after lockdown and they got married in Arya samaj.\n\nAfter 1 year of marriage she started behaving controlling like leave your friends stay home with me all the time! Mind that she was 5-6 years older to him, he didn’t want to leave his friends and wanted to drink occasionally  with his friends but whenever he made plans she threatened him by saying i will jump from the building or i will cut my hand!\n\nBefore this threatening happened, my friend bought a house on his name and made his wife the nominee! But later on he could not take all this and he ran off!\n\nIt’s been 3 years since he has left his own home! She took all the stuff from the house which had some very expensive stuff also! She took property papers too which is in her bank locker! \n\nWhen she didn’t respond to mutual divorce! My friend met a girl and have been living with her and wants to marry her so he decided to talk to an advocate! Now he got to know she was married before but never divorced her first husband! Lawyer told him if my friend wants to marry again he can but he needs to forget about his own house any all the stuff including money in joint account with her!\n\nNow finally his wife filled a complaint saying he tortured her basically 498 or something! And she also included his mother and sister in it when he has been living away from family for past 11 years and she met the family twice only that too for lunch or dinner only!\n\nSo he wants to know that she can take away his home and joint account money? Which is his only asset as his family doesn’t talk to him and have nothing else. And as she is not divorced before so can she still claim everything ?",

If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.\"\n\nIt's not even due to outside damage or misuse which they mention in their warranty terms, it's literally the cheap quality of plastic used in the headband. Also if it's not covered under the warranty claim, then why replace them for customers outside of India? This is a well known defect and they've very much acknowledged it in the past as well, I am positively mystified at this remark.\n\nIs there something I can do legally to get them to honor this warranty claim?

She discovered that massive, decades-old trees on the school campus had been cut down.\n\n\n2. The school headmaster had permission to cut only one dead/dried-out tree and this was done by the concerned authorities by following the procedure few days back\n\n\n3.

The wood from these trees is very valuable and is intended for personal profit.\n\n\n5. As per procedure, tree-felling requires permission from BBMP or the Karnataka Forest Department, who also handle the cutting and removal process. This wasn’t followed.\n\n\n6. My mother recorded videos of the site as evidence and is considering filing a complaint.\n\n\n\nMy Concerns:\n\nIf my mother or I escalate this (e.g., filing a complaint or posting on Twitter), could we face any legal trouble or retaliation from the school/headmaster?\n\nIs there any other legal procedure or body we should approach to address this?\n\n\nKey Questions for Advice:\n\n1. What are the potential legal risks for us if we take this forward?\n\n\n2. What steps should we take to ensure this is handled legally and safely?\n\n\n3.

I gave and served my 1 month notice fully(as mentioned in the employement letter) and got the asset clearance form from them after a month and received no communication from their end since then for over 3-4 months, the HR department and the founder has stayed mum even after I served them a legal notice a few weeks back but I still have not received my FNF amount or any communication regarding it.\n\nWhat should be my next step? I have heard things in consumer court take alot of time and at this point mentally and financially I'm spent. There are other employees as well with their FNF not paid yet and no communication as well from the company, is there any way labour court can be reached etc? Kindly suggest ",

The location is Uttar Pradesh (Ghaziabad).\n\nI have a few questions regarding property ownership:\n\t1.\tIf a son and mother are joint owners of a property, and the son suddenly passes away, who becomes the owner of the property? The son is survived by a wife; will the property now be jointly owned by both the mother and the daughter-in-law?\n\n\t2.\tWhen the property was registered, both the son and the mother were listed as joint owners. However, it was mentioned that the registry included a discount due to the woman’s ownership. Does this imply that the registry is in the mother’s name, and that the property will be transferred solely to her?\n\n\t3.\tIf the property is transferred to the mother’s name, does the daughter-in-law have any rights to it?\n\n\t4.\tIf the mother ultimately receives the property, can she transfer it as a gift to her daughter in order to prevent the daughter-in-law from acquiring any rights to it?\n\nLooking forward to any insights!",

        "selftext": "This post is based on my understanding of the **Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill, 2024**. If there are any mistakes or inaccuracies, please let me know in the comments! I'm happy to learn and discuss. 😊\n\n# Uttarakhand Implements Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in 2024\n\nThe Uttarakhand government has introduced the **Uniform Civil Code (UCC)**, making it the first Indian state to adopt a unified legal framework for all its residents. This law simplifies and regulates matters like **marriage, divorce, inheritance**, and **live-in relationships**, ensuring everyone is treated equally under the same set of laws, regardless of their religion or cultural practices.\n\n# Key Points of the UCC\n\n1. **Marriage Rules:**\n   * Both partners must be **unmarried** at the time of marriage.\n   * Minimum age for marriage: **21 years for men, 18 years for women.**\n   * Marriage between close relatives (prohibited relationships) is not allowed unless permitted by specific customs, and those customs must not go against public policy.\n2. **Polygamy Banned:**\n   * Polygamy is **prohibited for everyone**, including communities where it was previously allowed (e.g., Muslim personal laws).\n   * Only **monogamous marriages** will be legally valid under the UCC.\n3. **Mandatory Marriage Registration:**\n   * Every marriage, even if solemnized outside Uttarakhand, must be registered with the authorities if at least one partner is a resident of the state.\n   * Marriages conducted since **2010** must also be registered retroactively.\n4. **Live-in Relationships:**\n   * Couples in live-in relationships must register their partnership within **30 days** of living together.\n   * **Children born from live-in relationships are considered legitimate** and will have inheritance rights.\n   * Women deserted by live-in partners can claim **financial support (maintenance)** through the courts.\n5. **Equal Inheritance Rights:**\n   * Both sons and daughters are given **equal inheritance rights** to their parents’ property, ensuring gender equality.\n6. **Religious Freedom for Ceremonies:**\n   * Couples can marry following their own religious or customary traditions, such as **Saptapadi, Nikah, Holy Union**, or **Anand Karaj.**\n\n# Who Does It Apply To?\n\n* The UCC applies to **all residents of Uttarakhand**, even those living outside the state.\n* **Scheduled Tribes** and groups with **protected customary practices** under the Constitution are exempt from this Code.\n\n# What Changes Under the UCC?\n\nThe UCC replaces personal laws based on religion with a **common set of rules** for everyone. For example:\n\n* Practices like **polygamy** are no longer allowed.\n* There is now a standardized procedure for marriage, divorce, and property inheritance.\n* Women in both marriages and live-in relationships have clear legal protections.\n\nFINE AND IMPRISONMENT \n\n* Under the Uttarakhand UCC, 2024, failing to submit a live-in relationship statement can result in:\n\nFine: Up to ₹10,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 3 months.\n\nProviding false information or ignoring notices can lead to stricter penalties, including:\n\nFine: Up to ₹25,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 6 months.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI need assistance with a passport issue for my father. The problem is related to a name correction in his passport application. Here’s the situation:\n\n* My father already has a passport, but it expired 5 years ago.\n* He renewed his passport in 2009, and at that time, due to a misunderstanding, his name was recorded incorrectly. Specifically, his grandfather’s name (father's father's name) was included, resulting in a trimmed/abbreviated version of his actual name.\n* Now, his old passport has a name that doesn’t match his Aadhaar card or other documents.\n\nWe recently applied for a passport renewal and visited the Passport Seva Kendra with all the necessary documents for a name correction. However, the officer in charge put the application on hold and insisted that we update the name on his Aadhaar card to match the old passport.\n\nWhile changing the name on the Aadhaar card is possible, it would create a ripple effect, as many other documents (bank accounts, property papers, etc.) are linked to the current name on his Aadhaar. This is the name we prefer to maintain, as it’s consistent across all other documents.\n\nOur goal is to correct the name in the passport to match the Aadhaar card, rather than changing the Aadhaar card to match the old passport. Is there any way to achieve this? Has anyone faced a similar situation or have advice on how to resolve this issue?\n\nAny guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI need help understanding what to do in this situation.\n\nThere was a building located on in Kattakada, Thiruvananthapuram, that was severely damaged in a fire in May 2024. It’s in an unsafe condition, with structural instability, burnt debris, and residual oil spills. Despite this, the previous tenant is trying to resume operations there, posing serious risks to public safety.\n\nHere’s what has happened so far:\n\n1. A grievance was filed with the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office, and the issue was forwarded to the District Joint Director (LSGD) and then to the Panchayat.\n\n1. The Panchayat’s investigation report merely stated that “the building is partially ruined” without addressing concerns like structural instability or chemical hazards. No actions have been taken so far.\n\n1. The grievance was closed by the Joint Director's office without verifying if the Panchayat's response addressed the concerns or if any appropriate action was taken.\n\n1. When approached, the Panchayat, the officials said that the Panchayat isn’t responsible for stopping businesses from operating in unsafe premises, but they didn’t clarify which authority is.\n\nI’m not sure what to do next. I’ve contacted multiple authorities, but no action has been taken so far.\n\nMy questions:\n\n* Which authority is responsible for preventing businesses from operating in unsafe buildings in Kerala?\n\n* Should this be escalated to any higher authority?\n\n* Is there any foul play happening? Is that the reason no authority is taking any action?\n\n* How can I ensure that this matter is taken seriously and that action is initiated?\n\nI will attach photos of the burnt building for reference. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!\n\n ",

Since the smuggler wasn’t caught during the incident, they charged me—the car owner—as an accused.\n\nThe lawyer told me I need to:\n\nGo to Bihar to get bail for my name.\nFile cases in the civil court, DM court, and then the high court to get my car back.\n\nThey also said Zoomcar cannot help me further.\nI hired a lawyer to handle this, but after 9 months, there has been no progress.

My family, work, and studies are all suffering, and I’m experiencing severe anxiety and depression because of this ordeal.\n\nI feel completely helpless and stuck.

I’ve marked the old wire line with ----. Now, our neighbor also wants to shift the poles to the end of their land along the highway. The last two poles are on our land, forming a straight line perpendicular to the road.\n\nThey are saying it won’t be possible without our cooperation (but I know that even if we don’t shift our pole, which is already on our land away from the highway, the second pole near the highway is in the right place). We can't refuse outright because we live in a village and are expected to cooperate.\n\nThe issue is the total cost. The electricity department has quoted around **₹3.5 lakhs** for the shift. They say we will get an official receipt from the government. Since the poles are on the land of three families (including ours), our share of the cost would be around **₹1.2 lakhs**.\n\nI want to understand the process for this:\n\n1. Can they charge this much?\n2. Is it true that the electricity department installs new poles when shifting old ones?\n\n**Other info:**\n\n* **State**: Uk\n* Why shift - We currently have no problem with the poles being on our land since the area is used for farming. However, some neighbors have built buildings nearby, so they are the ones who want this shift.\n* The poles don’t supply electricity to the village (not sure), but I think they are primarily for factories using high-voltage lines.",

Once we even had to fight the family because the resident was literally up on a neem tree and cutting a branch himself. \nTurns out the MCF guys visited today (not sure if this is true), and said they need to cut some branches because they are touching the electricity grid wires. Well, okay. Assuming it is true, fine. \nBUT. \nThey have CLEARLY CUT SO MUCH MORE THAN NECESSARY. TREES THAT DID NOT EVEN HAVE ANY BRANCHES TOUCHING OR NEAR THE WIRES HAVE BEEN CUT DOWN. \nI spoke to the people cutting it down and they said that some was for the MCF work, but the society families have also come and requested them to cut extra without telling anyone. \n\nWhat can I do here? \n\nIt's painful to see. It's so incredibly wrong. 20+ years of strong, beautiful, lush green trees just cut down. These stupid men and women don't realise that these very trees provided shade in summers, which are increasingly unbearable each year. \n\nI want to slap some legal on the society management so that they know things dont go without consequences.

        "selftext": "We are a Muslim family from Maharashtra, and I am sharing my sister’s painful story. She was married in 2020 through an arranged marriage. The groom’s family seemed educated but turned out to be extremely controlling and orthodox. From the very first day, my sister faced mental and physical abuse.\n\nHere’s what she went through:\n\n1. **No Freedom from Day One:** On the first day after her wedding, her in-laws took away her phone and sent it back to us. When she asked her husband, he told her that daughters-in-law in their house are not allowed to have phones and she should use his phone instead. To avoid arguments, my sister gave up her phone and her connection to the outside world.\n2. **Total Control Over Her Life:** Her in-laws controlled everything—what she wore, who she talked to, what she ate, even how and when she laughed.\n3. **No Respect in Her Marriage:** Her husband ignored her completely. He spent most of his time with a girl named \"Gudiya,\" who lived with the family but wasn’t related to them. Shockingly, they even shared my sister’s bed while she was forced to sleep on the floor. He avoided talking to her and came home late at night to avoid any confrontation.\n4. **Her Career Dreams Crushed:** My sister is highly qualified (MA in Geography and B.Ed) and wanted to become a professor. Her husband was also a teacher before their marriage, so we thought he would support her dreams. But after marriage, she found out he had quit his job because his mother told him to. When she tried to prepare for exams like NET/SET, her sister-in-law created drama and stopped her from studying.\n5. **No Healthcare or Basic Dignity:** If she fell sick, she was mocked for being weak. They refused to take her to the doctor unless her condition was serious.\n6. **Gold and Dowry Demands:** Her in-laws constantly praised their elder daughter-in-law for bringing dowry and gold every month. They took all the gold my sister brought with her and kept it in a bank without her consent.\n\nShe silently endured this abuse for two years before finally telling us everything. We immediately filed a domestic violence case against her in-laws and husband.\n\n**Legal Struggles**\n\nSince filing the case, her in-laws have avoided every court hearing by manipulating the police and the system. Over a year has passed, and they haven’t attended a single hearing. Meanwhile, my sister has to go to every hearing, reliving her trauma.\n\nEven when a non-bailable warrant was issued, they managed to escape. Their lawyer even got permission for them to skip court appearances. The judge handling the case seems hesitant to take any action, leaving my sister stuck.\n\nTo make things worse, during this time, her husband secretly married another woman without my sister’s consent. While he lives happily, my sister is left to deal with endless legal battles and mental pain.\n\nWe once thought of settling the matter out of court to get her a divorce, but her in-laws refused. They want to “set an example” for other daughters-in-law, showing what happens if they speak out.\n\n**We are desperate for help.** All we want is for my sister to get a divorce and move on with her life.\n\n**Questions We Need Help With:**\n\n1. How can we speed up the court process and make sure her in-laws and husband are held responsible?\n2. What legal steps can we take to secure a divorce and protect her future?\n3. How do we fight the manipulation of the police and courts by her in-laws?\n4. Can stricter action be taken against her husband for marrying another woman without her consent?\n\nPlease help us. My sister deserves a chance to live her life with dignity and hope.",

I can't imagine this ending in any way other than divorce. Whether it's next week or 5 years from now, it will happen.\n\nQuestion: How do I keep myself prepared. I know I can contact a divorce lawyer, but what about other things like removing her as the beneficiary from my investments, how do I handle my daughter's schooling, what about all the documents where she is mentioned as my wife. Would a divorce lawyer help me with these?\n\nIn case it matters, we are Muslims. No official marriage certificate but there's a nikahnama and her name is on my passport.",

One of the second generation hier is educated while the rest are not(let’s call him and his kin A and the rest XYZ). This has caused a lot of issues over the years which I will summarise in points. Please feel free to give any info about individual points as well. \n\n1) So A is the only one in possession of the original will and all other survey papers (at least claims to be) and with his he is always encroaching everyone’s property by stating that XYZ have built houses outside the boundaries. \n\nI figure I can get the survey results through a legal process, but the will and other documents, is there a legal process to request him to share all documents that he claims to be the sources with others?\n\n2) A and XYZ agreed to give the said property to a builder for development purposes in 2001. There was some advance money paid out by the builder and there was no development started by the developer in a long time. Since XYZ had no employment, they took out several more advances throughout the years from the said builder, now 20 years later, there is still no development and even though we’re willing to pay the money back (even with interest) the developer isn’t make any progress. \n\nWhat can we do in this situation? \n\nThis has been going on since I was a kid and now I earn quite well and I want to help my dad using some money I can spend. It’s been really hard to see him struggle with his relatives. Any input or suggestions of legal teams are welcome! Thank you for taking the time to read!  ",

        "selftext": "Hi,   \n  \nI want to know certain things. I have been living in rent in a property managed by The Helloworld Coliving in Mumbai. I am facing a fundamental necessity issue, which is drinking water, for which they were supposed to put up a water purifier on the property. They provide water that the property's caretaker refills from another property, and a 20ltr can be used for five people. I have faced multiple issues, such as   \n1. Refilling the water from my friend's place.   \n2. No water available in the middle of the night  \n3. The caretaker not being available to get water, which I have to purchase from Blinkit  \n  \nI had raised multiple complaints with their support team, but they closed the ticket without providing an update or getting a customer response. Their customer service number is provided on the website. I called multiple times, but no one answered the calls. Sometimes, someone responded, but they lack basic essentialnication and accountability. \n\nThe biggest culprit is the property manager; I am sure he has never visited the property. He does most of his work via phone like a mafia boss. Most of the time, he has made false promises and no accountability. Whenever an issue is raised in a call, he gives vague timelines like \"it will be done\". And the biggest irony is that there is only one property manager for the entire location. The support team mainly contacts the property manager to resolve tickets. IItis like a Ponzi scheme where the issue goes completely unheard. I am paying 30k as rent for one single room; I mean, there is a TV, a F#\\*\\*ING TV in the amenities, which is entirely useless but no Water Purifier. The management should be pretty dumb and lame to come up with this.\n\n  \nNow the reason I am facing eviction is I have already mentioned to the support team on email that I will be withholding my rent payment until my issue is fixed which they don't seem to care about as they closed those support tickets which I have raised saying the issue has been fixed but in ground reality nothing's been done. I am clear that when I signed the agreement Water Purifer was part of the amenities that they were supposed to provide. What should I do in this case?",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI need some legal advice regarding a complicated situation.\n\nBackground: I come from a lower-income family. My mother left me immediately when I was born due to psychiatric issues and has lived with her parents for over 25 years. Dad tried applying for divorce, but with no address, no answer or response, he didn't get the divorce. I grew up with my father’s parents, who passed away in 2018.\n\nAfter 15+ years of waiting, My dad (58) found a live-in partner in 2010 who agreed to live without divorce or marriage initially.. She (40) a divorcee with two kids from her first marriage. She didn't tell anything and all lies about her first husband being drunkard and so on. \nThings went downhill quickly with her living in my home— within 1 month my grandparents started losing things, theft, bad behavior, and targeting on property. Whenever dad is at home she acts like an angel with me and grandparents.\n\nGrandparents kicked her out within 1 month and my dad and she have lived separately since 2012 in a rented home.\n\nI am disabled and 90% deaf, and I live in the house my grandparents built in Bangalore. My dad visits daily to help me out with household chores.\n\nIn 2015, dad discovered she had an affair in her first marriage that led to her divorce. Even with dad she had affairs late night talks and dad once caught a guy in home when she was alone. She just brushed it off saying friends. \n\nIn 2017, she had lung cancer, which she made my dad financially supported for operation and recovery.\n\nIn 2018, she had medical treatment to conceive again and ended up having a child without my dad’s decision as well. We don't even know if the kid belongs to dad. She hid this news until the 6th month.\n\nIn 2021, they had a violent fight, leading to police involvement. She took the child and ran to Kerala. She’s using the child to emotionally blackmail dad and has sent legal notices to my address claiming dowry and demanding to live in my home. Despite her issues, people seem to side with her. She tried to barge into my home and dad tried to push her out, leading to my name being included in an FIR.\n\nNow, in 2025, a similar fight happened in their rental home and police were called again.\n\nShe’s sending more legal notices through lawyers in Kerala and demands my dad appear before the Kerala Vanitha Committee on a date. \nThis notice came through my home address and dad unknowingly signed and took the letter, later he was regretting he should not have taken in my home address. \n\nThe latest issue is that she wants to live in my home, as my dad has no income.\nAnd she wants dad to marry her in order to see the child or to be in peace, else she would work on creating issues. \n\nMy dad has a small 1BHK near Electronic City around agricultural land, but she refuses to live there and insists on coming to my home.\n\nShe is also trying to involve me in all this and I suspect she'll again try to enter my home forcefully to live in.\n\nI’m already struggling with my disability unable to work effectively, lost my future, and finances aspects, and now the added legal fees and headache are difficult to pay. \n\nMy home is still in my grandparents' name, and I need to settle a amount as per will with my dad's sister to own it in my name which i am yet to do. \n\nWhat can I legally do to stop her from sending these notices and pulling me into this mess?\nCan i send a return notice to not disturb me and my dad does not stay here in my home? \n\nI don’t want her to stay in my home. Should I send a response to the lawyer stating my dad doesn’t live with me full-time? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nI’m also worried for my dad, who is 58 and having knee issues and worsening health not sure what kind of trouble will he be in. \nHow can i help my dad here. I know he did msny mistakes. But he supports me and understand my issues and try to help me as much as possible. \n\nI have no one to approach or ask for help, no relatives would come in for help unless there is a death. ",

Around the same time, my sister's old friend who had a new Instagram account also messaged her. We didn't know it was a friend. We thought it was one of the miscreants. Some rude messages were exchanged and then that person (friend) stopped. \n1. We filed an FIR against all the 4 anonymous Insta accounts. \n1. The police got their real names from Meta company. \n1.

Background:\n\nI applied for a teaching post where the notification mentioned that only candidates with a B.Ed. in Special Education are eligible.\n\nHowever, I knew the qualifications mentioned in the notification were incomplete because, based on past vacancies, candidates with a graduation + special diploma (recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India, RCI) were also eligible.\n\nThe RCI is the only body authorized to decide eligibility criteria for such posts, not the government.\n\n\n\n2.

As he went through each item to confirm everything was there with all tags intact, he kept asking me the total value of the order and saying \"Ye order toh kaafi mehenga hoga na madam?\" \nI didn't respond and asked him to verify if it was him who was supposed to pick it up. And he said yes and that it was his first day of work so he is new to all this. I verified his phone number from the Delhivery app and then handed him my entire parcel. I later got an email from Delhivery that day that my order was picked up. \n\nOn 3rd Jan 2025, I received and email from Delhivery that my parcel was returned to Zara warehouse. Usually, when we return items to Zara, we get an email from them confirming that they have received it and the refund will be processed. I kept waiting for that email but didn't get one. I contacted Zara's customer service on 10th Jan 2025 and they told me they had only received one sweater in the parcel and it was a non-Zara item so they will not be giving me a refund. I have been chasing them ever since through calls every other day and their executives keep telling me to wait for 24-48 hours as my case has been expedited. But it's going to be month since I returned all the items. \n\nI have my suspicions that the Delhivery pickup guy stole my parcel and handed them random item. But I have not even been able to reach out to Delhivery since they deactivate their AWBs within 15 days. And their automated customer service says to contact the seller. And Zara has been utterly useless in those terms. \n\nI really need my money back. \n\nIs this worth filing a case in consumer court? How can we do it? Or is there any other way I can get them to give my refund. ",

They paid 90000 as a booking amount of the total Rs 3,15,000 (Food and Venue only, no decoration.). \n\nThey had booked the pool side venue, however at the time of booking, the pool was operational for members and functions were not being conducted. The Salesperson told us that we can come in November to look at their poolside functions to finalize our decoration.\n\nFast forward to end of November, we had not heard anything from the sales person, and after following up with her multiple times to give us a time to visit the venue for tasting and to see the decoration, she finally gave us a date of Dec 4th. She had informed us that there would be a wedding function in the eve of 4th Dec where we can see sample decoration and taste the food. \n\nWhen on Dec 4th we reached the venue, it was in an ABYSSMAL condition. It looked like they were taking apart the decoration instead of putting it up. Keep in mind that we went there at 8 pm, and the wedding guests had almost started to arrive. \n\nThe entire venue was covered in used straws and disposable spoons/plates, maybe from the day before function and nobody had bothered cleaning it up. The sofa for the bride and groom was dirty and torn and had food/stains marks all over. The low chairs for the bride and groom during pheras, were dirty, and had holes in them. Without getting into more details, it was a very horrible setup.\n\nNow based on all of this, we decided to confront the sales lady (who had been trying to avoid us the entire time btw), and we told them to cancel the venue. \n\nWe had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. With to and fro with the venue management, we were able to get them to send an email to us stating that they will refund \"the amount that we paid at the time of booking\" and that we can expect the refund in 3rd week of January 2025. \n\nHowever, since passing of 3rd week of Jan 2025, they have stopped responding and keep saying that they will send a final date soon. \n\nTldr: A family member booked a poolside wedding venue in Sec 56, Gurgaon, for July 7, 2024, paying ₹90,000 upfront (total ₹3,15,000). The salesperson promised a visit in November to view decorations and food tasting, but after delays, they finally scheduled it for Dec 4. Upon visiting, the venue was in terrible condition—dirty, torn furniture, and no proper setup despite an ongoing event. The family decided to cancel, however they had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. Upon negotiations, the family got an email confirmation of a refund with the venue management. The venue promised a refund by mid-Jan 2025 but has since stopped responding and delayed giving a final refund date. \n\nWhat legal steps can the family take to recover this amount? \n\n",

        "selftext": "Married woman, married another man without divorce \n\nHi, this happened to my friend as he is not on reddit i decided to post on his behalf for some information. It’s going to be little long but he actually needs help so please read\n\nHe met a girl in 2019 they fell in love and started living together later he got to know that she was married but she said they got divorced and he trusted her! Then 6 months into the relationship she was after him to get married within 5-10 days as her mother was sick and there won’t be any auspicious day after 30th of some month i don’t remember. He tried to explain her that marriage doesn’t happen quickly and he doesn’t earn enough to be married and he also want big wedding someday! But she kept forcing him by saying I don’t care about big wedding i want small wedding!\nIt was just after lockdown and they got married in Arya samaj.\n\nAfter 1 year of marriage she started behaving controlling like leave your friends stay home with me all the time! Mind that she was 5-6 years older to him, he didn’t want to leave his friends and wanted to drink occasionally  with his friends but whenever he made plans she threatened him by saying i will jump from the building or i will cut my hand!\n\nBefore this threatening happened, my friend bought a house on his name and made his wife the nominee! But later on he could not take all this and he ran off!\n\nIt’s been 3 years since he has left his own home! She took all the stuff from the house which had some very expensive stuff also! She took property papers too which is in her bank locker! \n\nWhen she didn’t respond to mutual divorce! My friend met a girl and have been living with her and wants to marry her so he decided to talk to an advocate! Now he got to know she was married before but never divorced her first husband! Lawyer told him if my friend wants to marry again he can but he needs to forget about his own house any all the stuff including money in joint account with her!\n\nNow finally his wife filled a complaint saying he tortured her basically 498 or something! And she also included his mother and sister in it when he has been living away from family for past 11 years and she met the family twice only that too for lunch or dinner only!\n\nSo he wants to know that she can take away his home and joint account money? Which is his only asset as his family doesn’t talk to him and have nothing else. And as she is not divorced before so can she still claim everything ?",

I looked it up and it seems like it's a relatively common QC issue in this particular model. There's plenty of proof here - [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/wx2opz/the_headband_on_my_q30_headphones_broke_after_a/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/lhcei6/soundcore_q30_design_flaw_the_plastic_clips_next/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/xlvwjj/another_broken_soundcore_q30/) [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/187blhc/soundcore_q30_part_broke/) [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/nv4jhk/my_soundcore_q30_broke_always_felt_right_side_was/)\n\nI contacted Anker regarding the 18 Month Warranty claim since a good few people got a new pair after the brittle plastic headband broke the same way, or at least that's what they claimed on their respective reddit threads. I contacted them via email regarding the same and I was shocked by their reply. They said and I quote - \n\n\"I'm sorry to hear about the damage to your product. Unfortunately, according to our policy, we do not provide a warranty if the product is damaged or lost due to improper use. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.\"\n\nIt's not even due to outside damage or misuse which they mention in their warranty terms, it's literally the cheap quality of plastic used in the headband. Also if it's not covered under the warranty claim, then why replace them for customers outside of India? This is a well known defect and they've very much acknowledged it in the past as well, I am positively mystified at this remark.\n\nIs there something I can do legally to get them to honor this warranty claim? Seems like they've shut down my ticket too.",

She discovered that massive, decades-old trees on the school campus had been cut down.\n\n\n2. The school headmaster had permission to cut only one dead/dried-out tree and this was done by the concerned authorities by following the procedure few days back\n\n\n3.

The wood from these trees is very valuable and is intended for personal profit.\n\n\n5.

The son is survived by a wife; will the property now be jointly owned by both the mother and the daughter-in-law?\n\n\t2.\tWhen the property was registered, both the son and the mother were listed as joint owners. However, it was mentioned that the registry included a discount due to the woman’s ownership. Does this imply that the registry is in the mother’s name, and that the property will be transferred solely to her?\n\n\t3.\tIf the property is transferred to the mother’s name, does the daughter-in-law have any rights to it?\n\n\t4.\tIf the mother ultimately receives the property, can she transfer it as a gift to her daughter in order to prevent the daughter-in-law from acquiring any rights to it?\n\nLooking forward to any insights!",

        "selftext": "I have been renting an apartment in Mumbai since December 2022. I initially signed up for one year, then renewed it twice for one year each (December 2023 and December 2024). So the latest agreement is over a month old.\n\nHowever, the landlord in question has not been paying the society maintenance charges for a year now. In addition, a couple of days ago, I also received a Property Tax Demand (Rs. 16K or so) from the BMC meaning he hasn't been paying that either. I have been forwarding these to him over WhatsApp.\n\nThe society office is on my side, and are asking me not to pay the rent for the next month (I planned to pay it as per schedule on Feb 5). They say this will put adequate pressure on him to turn up and clear their bill. Should I proceed with not paying?\n\nAlso, I don't want to deal with this headache anyway - can I just take the hit on my security deposit and walk away, no questions asked? The security deposit is worth approx 3 months of rent. The agreement has a clause saying there is a lock-in period of 6 months, but it also states in another part that the landlord is responsible for paying all the bills. \n\nWhat should I do?",

They rammed into my car and got heavily injured themselves and there was a lot of damage caused to my car as well. I called the police and went to the police station , filed the report and did all the necessary things. \n\nNow the issue is , the other party doesn’t wanna take the issue to the court , infact , they haven’t even contacted the police even once. Now my car is stuck in the police station. I got in contact with a lawyer and he said he’s gonna get a court order and get my car released but he’s demanding 20k for this procedure. \n\nWhat can I do in this scenario?

        "selftext": "This post is based on my understanding of the **Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill, 2024**. If there are any mistakes or inaccuracies, please let me know in the comments! I'm happy to learn and discuss. 😊\n\n# Uttarakhand Implements Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in 2024\n\nThe Uttarakhand government has introduced the **Uniform Civil Code (UCC)**, making it the first Indian state to adopt a unified legal framework for all its residents. This law simplifies and regulates matters like **marriage, divorce, inheritance**, and **live-in relationships**, ensuring everyone is treated equally under the same set of laws, regardless of their religion or cultural practices.\n\n# Key Points of the UCC\n\n1. **Marriage Rules:**\n   * Both partners must be **unmarried** at the time of marriage.\n   * Minimum age for marriage: **21 years for men, 18 years for women.**\n   * Marriage between close relatives (prohibited relationships) is not allowed unless permitted by specific customs, and those customs must not go against public policy.\n2. **Polygamy Banned:**\n   * Polygamy is **prohibited for everyone**, including communities where it was previously allowed (e.g., Muslim personal laws).\n   * Only **monogamous marriages** will be legally valid under the UCC.\n3. **Mandatory Marriage Registration:**\n   * Every marriage, even if solemnized outside Uttarakhand, must be registered with the authorities if at least one partner is a resident of the state.\n   * Marriages conducted since **2010** must also be registered retroactively.\n4. **Live-in Relationships:**\n   * Couples in live-in relationships must register their partnership within **30 days** of living together.\n   * **Children born from live-in relationships are considered legitimate** and will have inheritance rights.\n   * Women deserted by live-in partners can claim **financial support (maintenance)** through the courts.\n5. **Equal Inheritance Rights:**\n   * Both sons and daughters are given **equal inheritance rights** to their parents’ property, ensuring gender equality.\n6. **Religious Freedom for Ceremonies:**\n   * Couples can marry following their own religious or customary traditions, such as **Saptapadi, Nikah, Holy Union**, or **Anand Karaj.**\n\n# Who Does It Apply To?\n\n* The UCC applies to **all residents of Uttarakhand**, even those living outside the state.\n* **Scheduled Tribes** and groups with **protected customary practices** under the Constitution are exempt from this Code.\n\n# What Changes Under the UCC?\n\nThe UCC replaces personal laws based on religion with a **common set of rules** for everyone. For example:\n\n* Practices like **polygamy** are no longer allowed.\n* There is now a standardized procedure for marriage, divorce, and property inheritance.\n* Women in both marriages and live-in relationships have clear legal protections.\n\nFINE AND IMPRISONMENT \n\n* Under the Uttarakhand UCC, 2024, failing to submit a live-in relationship statement can result in:\n\nFine: Up to ₹10,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 3 months.\n\nProviding false information or ignoring notices can lead to stricter penalties, including:\n\nFine: Up to ₹25,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 6 months.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI need assistance with a passport issue for my father. The problem is related to a name correction in his passport application. Here’s the situation:\n\n* My father already has a passport, but it expired 5 years ago.\n* He renewed his passport in 2009, and at that time, due to a misunderstanding, his name was recorded incorrectly. Specifically, his grandfather’s name (father's father's name) was included, resulting in a trimmed/abbreviated version of his actual name.\n* Now, his old passport has a name that doesn’t match his Aadhaar card or other documents.\n\nWe recently applied for a passport renewal and visited the Passport Seva Kendra with all the necessary documents for a name correction. However, the officer in charge put the application on hold and insisted that we update the name on his Aadhaar card to match the old passport.\n\nWhile changing the name on the Aadhaar card is possible, it would create a ripple effect, as many other documents (bank accounts, property papers, etc.) are linked to the current name on his Aadhaar. This is the name we prefer to maintain, as it’s consistent across all other documents.\n\nOur goal is to correct the name in the passport to match the Aadhaar card, rather than changing the Aadhaar card to match the old passport. Is there any way to achieve this? Has anyone faced a similar situation or have advice on how to resolve this issue?\n\nAny guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\n",

I started developing feelings for him, and I wanted to keep him as a friend, so I could have him in my life. We began talking on WhatsApp, but I kept it hidden from my husband and family. Eventually, I introduced him to my husband and family, but they didn’t like him. However, he didn’t say anything about it at first.**\n\n**When my husband found out I’d been hiding messages, he got extremely angry and started getting violent with me. He says he loves me a lot and is possessive, telling me I shouldn’t talk to anyone else. I tried to fight back, saying I want to continue talking to this person, but then my husband told my family about everything, and things got worse. My mom became physically abusive, and my family started saying awful things to me—things I never imagined they’d say.**\n\n**I feel trapped. My family is now threatening to hurt both me and the person I want to stay in touch with if I leave or continue talking to him. I’m staying with my husband for the sake of my kids, even though I feel completely helpless. The person I wanted to talk to is no longer speaking to me, and my family completely hates both me and him now.**\n\n**I’m terrified to even reach out to him, as my husband is tracking my phone and messages and has been threatening me. I honestly don’t know what to do. All are ignoring me and not letting me leave as well. I feel stuck, scared, and like I have no way out. Does anyone have advice on how to navigate this?**",

It’s in an unsafe condition, with structural instability, burnt debris, and residual oil spills. Despite this, the previous tenant is trying to resume operations there, posing serious risks to public safety.\n\nHere’s what has happened so far:\n\n1. A grievance was filed with the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office, and the issue was forwarded to the District Joint Director (LSGD) and then to the Panchayat.\n\n1. The Panchayat’s investigation report merely stated that “the building is partially ruined” without addressing concerns like structural instability or chemical hazards. No actions have been taken so far.\n\n1. The grievance was closed by the Joint Director's office without verifying if the Panchayat's response addressed the concerns or if any appropriate action was taken.\n\n1. When approached, the Panchayat, the officials said that the Panchayat isn’t responsible for stopping businesses from operating in unsafe premises, but they didn’t clarify which authority is.\n\nI’m not sure what to do next. I’ve contacted multiple authorities, but no action has been taken so far.\n\nMy questions:\n\n* Which authority is responsible for preventing businesses from operating in unsafe buildings in Kerala?\n\n* Should this be escalated to any higher authority?\n\n* Is there any foul play happening? Is that the reason no authority is taking any action?\n\n* How can I ensure that this matter is taken seriously and that action is initiated?\n\nI will attach photos of the burnt building for reference. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!\n\n ",

Apparently, the person who rented my car used it to smuggle a huge quantity of alcohol. Since the smuggler wasn’t caught during the incident, they charged me—the car owner—as an accused.\n\nThe lawyer told me I need to:\n\nGo to Bihar to get bail for my name.\nFile cases in the civil court, DM court, and then the high court to get my car back.\n\nThey also said Zoomcar cannot help me further.\nI hired a lawyer to handle this, but after 9 months, there has been no progress. This situation has taken a massive toll on my mental health. My family, work, and studies are all suffering, and I’m experiencing severe anxiety and depression because of this ordeal.\n\nI feel completely helpless and stuck.

I’ve marked the old wire line with ----. Now, our neighbor also wants to shift the poles to the end of their land along the highway. The last two poles are on our land, forming a straight line perpendicular to the road.\n\nThey are saying it won’t be possible without our cooperation (but I know that even if we don’t shift our pole, which is already on our land away from the highway, the second pole near the highway is in the right place). We can't refuse outright because we live in a village and are expected to cooperate.\n\nThe issue is the total cost. The electricity department has quoted around **₹3.5 lakhs** for the shift. They say we will get an official receipt from the government. Since the poles are on the land of three families (including ours), our share of the cost would be around **₹1.2 lakhs**.\n\nI want to understand the process for this:\n\n1. Can they charge this much?\n2. Is it true that the electricity department installs new poles when shifting old ones?\n\n**Other info:**\n\n* **State**: Uk\n* Why shift - We currently have no problem with the poles being on our land since the area is used for farming. However, some neighbors have built buildings nearby, so they are the ones who want this shift.\n* The poles don’t supply electricity to the village (not sure), but I think they are primarily for factories using high-voltage lines.",

        "selftext": "We are a Muslim family from Maharashtra, and I am sharing my sister’s painful story. She was married in 2020 through an arranged marriage. The groom’s family seemed educated but turned out to be extremely controlling and orthodox. From the very first day, my sister faced mental and physical abuse.\n\nHere’s what she went through:\n\n1. **No Freedom from Day One:** On the first day after her wedding, her in-laws took away her phone and sent it back to us. When she asked her husband, he told her that daughters-in-law in their house are not allowed to have phones and she should use his phone instead. To avoid arguments, my sister gave up her phone and her connection to the outside world.\n2. **Total Control Over Her Life:** Her in-laws controlled everything—what she wore, who she talked to, what she ate, even how and when she laughed.\n3. **No Respect in Her Marriage:** Her husband ignored her completely. He spent most of his time with a girl named \"Gudiya,\" who lived with the family but wasn’t related to them. Shockingly, they even shared my sister’s bed while she was forced to sleep on the floor. He avoided talking to her and came home late at night to avoid any confrontation.\n4. **Her Career Dreams Crushed:** My sister is highly qualified (MA in Geography and B.Ed) and wanted to become a professor. Her husband was also a teacher before their marriage, so we thought he would support her dreams. But after marriage, she found out he had quit his job because his mother told him to. When she tried to prepare for exams like NET/SET, her sister-in-law created drama and stopped her from studying.\n5. **No Healthcare or Basic Dignity:** If she fell sick, she was mocked for being weak. They refused to take her to the doctor unless her condition was serious.\n6. **Gold and Dowry Demands:** Her in-laws constantly praised their elder daughter-in-law for bringing dowry and gold every month. They took all the gold my sister brought with her and kept it in a bank without her consent.\n\nShe silently endured this abuse for two years before finally telling us everything. We immediately filed a domestic violence case against her in-laws and husband.\n\n**Legal Struggles**\n\nSince filing the case, her in-laws have avoided every court hearing by manipulating the police and the system. Over a year has passed, and they haven’t attended a single hearing. Meanwhile, my sister has to go to every hearing, reliving her trauma.\n\nEven when a non-bailable warrant was issued, they managed to escape. Their lawyer even got permission for them to skip court appearances. The judge handling the case seems hesitant to take any action, leaving my sister stuck.\n\nTo make things worse, during this time, her husband secretly married another woman without my sister’s consent. While he lives happily, my sister is left to deal with endless legal battles and mental pain.\n\nWe once thought of settling the matter out of court to get her a divorce, but her in-laws refused. They want to “set an example” for other daughters-in-law, showing what happens if they speak out.\n\n**We are desperate for help.** All we want is for my sister to get a divorce and move on with her life.\n\n**Questions We Need Help With:**\n\n1. How can we speed up the court process and make sure her in-laws and husband are held responsible?\n2. What legal steps can we take to secure a divorce and protect her future?\n3. How do we fight the manipulation of the police and courts by her in-laws?\n4. Can stricter action be taken against her husband for marrying another woman without her consent?\n\nPlease help us. My sister deserves a chance to live her life with dignity and hope.",

I met the ARO, and he said he would do the work after coming for inspection and the remaining 3 offices. Also, I have to pay, so he'll give a new pid number, and I agreed.\" - This is a direct quote.\n\nDecember 2024: We followed up with the seller again, and he replied: \"That also is at standstill as the sakala site is crashed from 2 months - no khatas and no e khata is being made.\" \n\nJanuary 2025: We followed up with the seller, and he asked for the sale deed copy so he could submit the Affidavit for Khata Bifurcation to get individual numbers for the offices on the floor on which our office is located. I confirmed with him today if he submitted and paid the fees in total. He said yes.\n\nBecause of this delay, we are unable to sell the office. In such a situation, does the buyer have a right to cancel the purchase although the property has been registered? Also, two companies refused to rent the office because we didn't have a khata.",

Please feel free to give any info about individual points as well. \n\n1) So A is the only one in possession of the original will and all other survey papers (at least claims to be) and with his he is always encroaching everyone’s property by stating that XYZ have built houses outside the boundaries. \n\nI figure I can get the survey results through a legal process, but the will and other documents, is there a legal process to request him to share all documents that he claims to be the sources with others?\n\n2) A and XYZ agreed to give the said property to a builder for development purposes in 2001. There was some advance money paid out by the builder and there was no development started by the developer in a long time. Since XYZ had no employment, they took out several more advances throughout the years from the said builder, now 20 years later, there is still no development and even though we’re willing to pay the money back (even with interest) the developer isn’t make any progress. \n\nWhat can we do in this situation? \n\nThis has been going on since I was a kid and now I earn quite well and I want to help my dad using some money I can spend. It’s been really hard to see him struggle with his relatives. Any input or suggestions of legal teams are welcome! Thank you for taking the time to read!  ",

        "selftext": "Hi,   \n  \nI want to know certain things. I have been living in rent in a property managed by The Helloworld Coliving in Mumbai. I am facing a fundamental necessity issue, which is drinking water, for which they were supposed to put up a water purifier on the property. They provide water that the property's caretaker refills from another property, and a 20ltr can be used for five people. I have faced multiple issues, such as   \n1. Refilling the water from my friend's place.   \n2. No water available in the middle of the night  \n3. The caretaker not being available to get water, which I have to purchase from Blinkit  \n  \nI had raised multiple complaints with their support team, but they closed the ticket without providing an update or getting a customer response. Their customer service number is provided on the website. I called multiple times, but no one answered the calls. Sometimes, someone responded, but they lack basic essentialnication and accountability. \n\nThe biggest culprit is the property manager; I am sure he has never visited the property. He does most of his work via phone like a mafia boss. Most of the time, he has made false promises and no accountability. Whenever an issue is raised in a call, he gives vague timelines like \"it will be done\". And the biggest irony is that there is only one property manager for the entire location. The support team mainly contacts the property manager to resolve tickets. IItis like a Ponzi scheme where the issue goes completely unheard. I am paying 30k as rent for one single room; I mean, there is a TV, a F#\\*\\*ING TV in the amenities, which is entirely useless but no Water Purifier. The management should be pretty dumb and lame to come up with this.\n\n  \nNow the reason I am facing eviction is I have already mentioned to the support team on email that I will be withholding my rent payment until my issue is fixed which they don't seem to care about as they closed those support tickets which I have raised saying the issue has been fixed but in ground reality nothing's been done. I am clear that when I signed the agreement Water Purifer was part of the amenities that they were supposed to provide. What should I do in this case?",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI need some legal advice regarding a complicated situation.\n\nBackground: I come from a lower-income family. My mother left me immediately when I was born due to psychiatric issues and has lived with her parents for over 25 years. Dad tried applying for divorce, but with no address, no answer or response, he didn't get the divorce. I grew up with my father’s parents, who passed away in 2018.\n\nAfter 15+ years of waiting, My dad (58) found a live-in partner in 2010 who agreed to live without divorce or marriage initially.. She (40) a divorcee with two kids from her first marriage. She didn't tell anything and all lies about her first husband being drunkard and so on. \nThings went downhill quickly with her living in my home— within 1 month my grandparents started losing things, theft, bad behavior, and targeting on property. Whenever dad is at home she acts like an angel with me and grandparents.\n\nGrandparents kicked her out within 1 month and my dad and she have lived separately since 2012 in a rented home.\n\nI am disabled and 90% deaf, and I live in the house my grandparents built in Bangalore. My dad visits daily to help me out with household chores.\n\nIn 2015, dad discovered she had an affair in her first marriage that led to her divorce. Even with dad she had affairs late night talks and dad once caught a guy in home when she was alone. She just brushed it off saying friends. \n\nIn 2017, she had lung cancer, which she made my dad financially supported for operation and recovery.\n\nIn 2018, she had medical treatment to conceive again and ended up having a child without my dad’s decision as well. We don't even know if the kid belongs to dad. She hid this news until the 6th month.\n\nIn 2021, they had a violent fight, leading to police involvement. She took the child and ran to Kerala. She’s using the child to emotionally blackmail dad and has sent legal notices to my address claiming dowry and demanding to live in my home. Despite her issues, people seem to side with her. She tried to barge into my home and dad tried to push her out, leading to my name being included in an FIR.\n\nNow, in 2025, a similar fight happened in their rental home and police were called again.\n\nShe’s sending more legal notices through lawyers in Kerala and demands my dad appear before the Kerala Vanitha Committee on a date. \nThis notice came through my home address and dad unknowingly signed and took the letter, later he was regretting he should not have taken in my home address. \n\nThe latest issue is that she wants to live in my home, as my dad has no income.\nAnd she wants dad to marry her in order to see the child or to be in peace, else she would work on creating issues. \n\nMy dad has a small 1BHK near Electronic City around agricultural land, but she refuses to live there and insists on coming to my home.\n\nShe is also trying to involve me in all this and I suspect she'll again try to enter my home forcefully to live in.\n\nI’m already struggling with my disability unable to work effectively, lost my future, and finances aspects, and now the added legal fees and headache are difficult to pay. \n\nMy home is still in my grandparents' name, and I need to settle a amount as per will with my dad's sister to own it in my name which i am yet to do. \n\nWhat can I legally do to stop her from sending these notices and pulling me into this mess?\nCan i send a return notice to not disturb me and my dad does not stay here in my home? \n\nI don’t want her to stay in my home. Should I send a response to the lawyer stating my dad doesn’t live with me full-time? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nI’m also worried for my dad, who is 58 and having knee issues and worsening health not sure what kind of trouble will he be in. \nHow can i help my dad here. I know he did msny mistakes. But he supports me and understand my issues and try to help me as much as possible. \n\nI have no one to approach or ask for help, no relatives would come in for help unless there is a death. ",

Some rude messages were exchanged and then that person (friend) stopped. \n1. We filed an FIR against all the 4 anonymous Insta accounts. \n1. The police got their real names from Meta company. \n1.

        "selftext": "\n\nI need advice regarding my eligibility for a teaching post and whether I should pursue a court case to claim the position. Here’s my situation:\n\n1. Background:\n\nI applied for a teaching post where the notification mentioned that only candidates with a B.Ed. in Special Education are eligible.\n\nHowever, I knew the qualifications mentioned in the notification were incomplete because, based on past vacancies, candidates with a graduation + special diploma (recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India, RCI) were also eligible.\n\nThe RCI is the only body authorized to decide eligibility criteria for such posts, not the government.\n\n\n\n2. My Qualifications at the Time:\n\nI had a special diploma and was pursuing my graduation. However, my graduation was incomplete at the time of application.\n\nDespite this, I filled out the form, sat for the exam, and scored more than 20 marks above the cutoff (in the 2x result list).\n\n\n\n3. Current Scenario:\n\nI did not attend document verification because I had not completed my graduation by the last date of application, as per the notification’s criteria. , also government was only allowing special bed candidates\n\nMeanwhile, the government sought clarification from the RCI regarding qualifications, and the RCI confirmed that diploma holders (like me) are also valid for the post.\n\nAnd after 6-8 months due to some answers get changed, 2x result was canceled, and a new, fresh result was released today. My roll number is still in this list.\n\n\n\n4. Dilemma:\n\nThe notification clearly stated that all qualifications must be completed by the last date of application, which I did not meet.\n\nHowever, I believe I am eligible for the post based on RCI's clarification and past precedence.\n\nI desperately need this job, and I worked incredibly hard for it.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\nDo I have a strong case if I file a court petition?\n\nWhat legal arguments can I make to strengthen my case?\n\nAre there any past judgments or legal principles that could support my claim?\n\n\nI understand my chances might be slim, but I want to explore all possible options.

        "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI had placed an order with Zara for 8 items worth 21k in Dec 2024. Unfortunately, all the items had some issue or the other in terms of size and fit so I decided to return it. I raised a request to return the items on 30th Dec and my order was picked up by a Delhivery guy on 31st Dec 2024. The person who picked it up was behaving very strangely. As he went through each item to confirm everything was there with all tags intact, he kept asking me the total value of the order and saying \"Ye order toh kaafi mehenga hoga na madam?\" \nI didn't respond and asked him to verify if it was him who was supposed to pick it up. And he said yes and that it was his first day of work so he is new to all this. I verified his phone number from the Delhivery app and then handed him my entire parcel. I later got an email from Delhivery that day that my order was picked up. \n\nOn 3rd Jan 2025, I received and email from Delhivery that my parcel was returned to Zara warehouse. Usually, when we return items to Zara, we get an email from them confirming that they have received it and the refund will be processed. I kept waiting for that email but didn't get one. I contacted Zara's customer service on 10th Jan 2025 and they told me they had only received one sweater in the parcel and it was a non-Zara item so they will not be giving me a refund. I have been chasing them ever since through calls every other day and their executives keep telling me to wait for 24-48 hours as my case has been expedited. But it's going to be month since I returned all the items. \n\nI have my suspicions that the Delhivery pickup guy stole my parcel and handed them random item. But I have not even been able to reach out to Delhivery since they deactivate their AWBs within 15 days. And their automated customer service says to contact the seller. And Zara has been utterly useless in those terms. \n\nI really need my money back. \n\nIs this worth filing a case in consumer court? How can we do it? Or is there any other way I can get them to give my refund. ",

        "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nThanks in advance for reading this huge wall of text :)\n\nA family member of mine booked a wedding hall/banquet situated in Sec 56 Gurgaon on July 7th 2024. They paid 90000 as a booking amount of the total Rs 3,15,000 (Food and Venue only, no decoration.). \n\nThey had booked the pool side venue, however at the time of booking, the pool was operational for members and functions were not being conducted. The Salesperson told us that we can come in November to look at their poolside functions to finalize our decoration.\n\nFast forward to end of November, we had not heard anything from the sales person, and after following up with her multiple times to give us a time to visit the venue for tasting and to see the decoration, she finally gave us a date of Dec 4th. She had informed us that there would be a wedding function in the eve of 4th Dec where we can see sample decoration and taste the food. \n\nWhen on Dec 4th we reached the venue, it was in an ABYSSMAL condition. It looked like they were taking apart the decoration instead of putting it up. Keep in mind that we went there at 8 pm, and the wedding guests had almost started to arrive. \n\nThe entire venue was covered in used straws and disposable spoons/plates, maybe from the day before function and nobody had bothered cleaning it up. The sofa for the bride and groom was dirty and torn and had food/stains marks all over. The low chairs for the bride and groom during pheras, were dirty, and had holes in them. Without getting into more details, it was a very horrible setup.\n\nNow based on all of this, we decided to confront the sales lady (who had been trying to avoid us the entire time btw), and we told them to cancel the venue. \n\nWe had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. With to and fro with the venue management, we were able to get them to send an email to us stating that they will refund \"the amount that we paid at the time of booking\" and that we can expect the refund in 3rd week of January 2025. \n\nHowever, since passing of 3rd week of Jan 2025, they have stopped responding and keep saying that they will send a final date soon. \n\nTldr: A family member booked a poolside wedding venue in Sec 56, Gurgaon, for July 7, 2024, paying ₹90,000 upfront (total ₹3,15,000). The salesperson promised a visit in November to view decorations and food tasting, but after delays, they finally scheduled it for Dec 4. Upon visiting, the venue was in terrible condition—dirty, torn furniture, and no proper setup despite an ongoing event. The family decided to cancel, however they had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. Upon negotiations, the family got an email confirmation of a refund with the venue management. The venue promised a refund by mid-Jan 2025 but has since stopped responding and delayed giving a final refund date. \n\nWhat legal steps can the family take to recover this amount? \n\n",

It’s going to be little long but he actually needs help so please read\n\nHe met a girl in 2019 they fell in love and started living together later he got to know that she was married but she said they got divorced and he trusted her! Then 6 months into the relationship she was after him to get married within 5-10 days as her mother was sick and there won’t be any auspicious day after 30th of some month i don’t remember. He tried to explain her that marriage doesn’t happen quickly and he doesn’t earn enough to be married and he also want big wedding someday! But she kept forcing him by saying I don’t care about big wedding i want small wedding!\nIt was just after lockdown and they got married in Arya samaj.\n\nAfter 1 year of marriage she started behaving controlling like leave your friends stay home with me all the time! Mind that she was 5-6 years older to him, he didn’t want to leave his friends and wanted to drink occasionally  with his friends but whenever he made plans she threatened him by saying i will jump from the building or i will cut my hand!\n\nBefore this threatening happened, my friend bought a house on his name and made his wife the nominee! But later on he could not take all this and he ran off!\n\nIt’s been 3 years since he has left his own home! She took all the stuff from the house which had some very expensive stuff also! She took property papers too which is in her bank locker! \n\nWhen she didn’t respond to mutual divorce! My friend met a girl and have been living with her and wants to marry her so he decided to talk to an advocate! Now he got to know she was married before but never divorced her first husband! Lawyer told him if my friend wants to marry again he can but he needs to forget about his own house any all the stuff including money in joint account with her!\n\nNow finally his wife filled a complaint saying he tortured her basically 498 or something! And she also included his mother and sister in it when he has been living away from family for past 11 years and she met the family twice only that too for lunch or dinner only!\n\nSo he wants to know that she can take away his home and joint account money? Which is his only asset as his family doesn’t talk to him and have nothing else. And as she is not divorced before so can she still claim everything ?",

I contacted them via email regarding the same and I was shocked by their reply. They said and I quote - \n\n\"I'm sorry to hear about the damage to your product. Unfortunately, according to our policy, we do not provide a warranty if the product is damaged or lost due to improper use. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.\"\n\nIt's not even due to outside damage or misuse which they mention in their warranty terms, it's literally the cheap quality of plastic used in the headband. Also if it's not covered under the warranty claim, then why replace them for customers outside of India? This is a well known defect and they've very much acknowledged it in the past as well, I am positively mystified at this remark.\n\nIs there something I can do legally to get them to honor this warranty claim? Seems like they've shut down my ticket too.",

However, I recently received an objection from the Registrar, stating that a part of the name is already registered by someone else in the same class.\n\nA few small law firms have contacted me, offering to assist with drafting and filing a response to the objection for a relatively low fee. They indicated that no hearing would be required since there’s only one cited mark, and they believe the chances of acceptance are good.\n\nIn contrast, I consulted an IP lawyer in my city, who explained that the process involves filing a response, attending 1–3 hearings, and then having the trademark granted by the Registrar, after which it would be open for public scrutiny. His fee for handling the response and hearings is significantly higher—three times the amount quoted by the smaller firms.\n\nTo the IP lawyers in this sub: What is the correct way forward?

        "selftext": "Context:\n\nMy mother is a Physical Education teacher at a government school in Bengaluru.\n\nAfter the Republic Day celebrations, she visited her school in the evening to take down and fold the national flag.\n\n\nWhat Happened:\n\n1. She discovered that massive, decades-old trees on the school campus had been cut down.\n\n\n2. The school headmaster had permission to cut only one dead/dried-out tree and this was done by the concerned authorities by following the procedure few days back\n\n\n3. But yesterday (26/1/25) me and my mom saw that the headmaster has illegally cut two healthy trees without proper authorization (she wasn't present at the sight) and we have a video evidence of the man admitting that the headmaster has payed him to cut.\n\n\n4. The wood from these trees is very valuable and is intended for personal profit.\n\n\n5. As per procedure, tree-felling requires permission from BBMP or the Karnataka Forest Department, who also handle the cutting and removal process. This wasn’t followed.\n\n\n6. My mother recorded videos of the site as evidence and is considering filing a complaint.\n\n\n\nMy Concerns:\n\nIf my mother or I escalate this (e.g., filing a complaint or posting on Twitter), could we face any legal trouble or retaliation from the school/headmaster?\n\nIs there any other legal procedure or body we should approach to address this?\n\n\nKey Questions for Advice:\n\n1. What are the potential legal risks for us if we take this forward?\n\n\n2. What steps should we take to ensure this is handled legally and safely?\n\n\n3. Is there any way to ensure anonymity for my mother while filing the complaint? I'm planning to post this on X(twitter) since benguluru police are active there from what I know ",

The redBus team suggested that I book another ticket on my own while they escalated the issue for a refund, asking me to wait 48 hours for a resolution.

In addition, a couple of days ago, I also received a Property Tax Demand (Rs. 16K or so) from the BMC meaning he hasn't been paying that either. I have been forwarding these to him over WhatsApp.\n\nThe society office is on my side, and are asking me not to pay the rent for the next month (I planned to pay it as per schedule on Feb 5). They say this will put adequate pressure on him to turn up and clear their bill. Should I proceed with not paying?\n\nAlso, I don't want to deal with this headache anyway - can I just take the hit on my security deposit and walk away, no questions asked? The security deposit is worth approx 3 months of rent. The agreement has a clause saying there is a lock-in period of 6 months, but it also states in another part that the landlord is responsible for paying all the bills. \n\nWhat should I do?",

        "selftext": "This post is based on my understanding of the **Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill, 2024**. If there are any mistakes or inaccuracies, please let me know in the comments! I'm happy to learn and discuss. 😊\n\n# Uttarakhand Implements Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in 2024\n\nThe Uttarakhand government has introduced the **Uniform Civil Code (UCC)**, making it the first Indian state to adopt a unified legal framework for all its residents. This law simplifies and regulates matters like **marriage, divorce, inheritance**, and **live-in relationships**, ensuring everyone is treated equally under the same set of laws, regardless of their religion or cultural practices.\n\n# Key Points of the UCC\n\n1. **Marriage Rules:**\n   * Both partners must be **unmarried** at the time of marriage.\n   * Minimum age for marriage: **21 years for men, 18 years for women.**\n   * Marriage between close relatives (prohibited relationships) is not allowed unless permitted by specific customs, and those customs must not go against public policy.\n2. **Polygamy Banned:**\n   * Polygamy is **prohibited for everyone**, including communities where it was previously allowed (e.g., Muslim personal laws).\n   * Only **monogamous marriages** will be legally valid under the UCC.\n3. **Mandatory Marriage Registration:**\n   * Every marriage, even if solemnized outside Uttarakhand, must be registered with the authorities if at least one partner is a resident of the state.\n   * Marriages conducted since **2010** must also be registered retroactively.\n4. **Live-in Relationships:**\n   * Couples in live-in relationships must register their partnership within **30 days** of living together.\n   * **Children born from live-in relationships are considered legitimate** and will have inheritance rights.\n   * Women deserted by live-in partners can claim **financial support (maintenance)** through the courts.\n5. **Equal Inheritance Rights:**\n   * Both sons and daughters are given **equal inheritance rights** to their parents’ property, ensuring gender equality.\n6. **Religious Freedom for Ceremonies:**\n   * Couples can marry following their own religious or customary traditions, such as **Saptapadi, Nikah, Holy Union**, or **Anand Karaj.**\n\n# Who Does It Apply To?\n\n* The UCC applies to **all residents of Uttarakhand**, even those living outside the state.\n* **Scheduled Tribes** and groups with **protected customary practices** under the Constitution are exempt from this Code.\n\n# What Changes Under the UCC?\n\nThe UCC replaces personal laws based on religion with a **common set of rules** for everyone. For example:\n\n* Practices like **polygamy** are no longer allowed.\n* There is now a standardized procedure for marriage, divorce, and property inheritance.\n* Women in both marriages and live-in relationships have clear legal protections.\n\nFINE AND IMPRISONMENT \n\n* Under the Uttarakhand UCC, 2024, failing to submit a live-in relationship statement can result in:\n\nFine: Up to ₹10,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 3 months.\n\nProviding false information or ignoring notices can lead to stricter penalties, including:\n\nFine: Up to ₹25,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 6 months.",

Here’s the situation:\n\n* My father already has a passport, but it expired 5 years ago.\n* He renewed his passport in 2009, and at that time, due to a misunderstanding, his name was recorded incorrectly. Specifically, his grandfather’s name (father's father's name) was included, resulting in a trimmed/abbreviated version of his actual name.\n* Now, his old passport has a name that doesn’t match his Aadhaar card or other documents.\n\nWe recently applied for a passport renewal and visited the Passport Seva Kendra with all the necessary documents for a name correction. However, the officer in charge put the application on hold and insisted that we update the name on his Aadhaar card to match the old passport.\n\nWhile changing the name on the Aadhaar card is possible, it would create a ripple effect, as many other documents (bank accounts, property papers, etc.) are linked to the current name on his Aadhaar. This is the name we prefer to maintain, as it’s consistent across all other documents.\n\nOur goal is to correct the name in the passport to match the Aadhaar card, rather than changing the Aadhaar card to match the old passport. Is there any way to achieve this? Has anyone faced a similar situation or have advice on how to resolve this issue?\n\nAny guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Her father lost her job during covid after which they joined vestige (scam ass foundation). after which the entire family is not looking towards developing skills but to enroll in more and more these kinds of scams. I have proof that she has THOUSANDS (yes im certain) of Aadhaar cards, photographs and stuff which im sure are ILLEGAL .. These Aadhaar cards were used for kyc for these new joiners and she used to send me those to edit (crop tilt etc) since i had a good hand in editing. These ids belonged to ppl from villages and ppl living in slums and u can tell they ain't well off that why enrolling in this scheme . I tried multiple time to make them stop but then the entire family is brainwashed to hell. Is there anything i can do to stop them without coming in picture?.. or is it too late?.. The father is still unemployed. elder child completed their studies and younger child is still studying in clg yet somehow they're still enrolled in this shit\n\nHhttps://www.jaalifestyle.com/\n\nthis is one of the website in which they're enrolled. just by looking u can tell its a scam.\n\ni really want to help them .. cus what they're doing (such as having 1000s of adhaar cards) is damn sure illegal and i don't want them to get into huge trouble for that.",

Eventually, I introduced him to my husband and family, but they didn’t like him.

He says he loves me a lot and is possessive, telling me I shouldn’t talk to anyone else. I tried to fight back, saying I want to continue talking to this person, but then my husband told my family about everything, and things got worse. My mom became physically abusive, and my family started saying awful things to me—things I never imagined they’d say.**\n\n**I feel trapped. My family is now threatening to hurt both me and the person I want to stay in touch with if I leave or continue talking to him. I’m staying with my husband for the sake of my kids, even though I feel completely helpless. The person I wanted to talk to is no longer speaking to me, and my family completely hates both me and him now.**\n\n**I’m terrified to even reach out to him, as my husband is tracking my phone and messages and has been threatening me. I honestly don’t know what to do. All are ignoring me and not letting me leave as well. I feel stuck, scared, and like I have no way out. Does anyone have advice on how to navigate this?**",

It’s in an unsafe condition, with structural instability, burnt debris, and residual oil spills. Despite this, the previous tenant is trying to resume operations there, posing serious risks to public safety.\n\nHere’s what has happened so far:\n\n1. A grievance was filed with the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office, and the issue was forwarded to the District Joint Director (LSGD) and then to the Panchayat.\n\n1. The Panchayat’s investigation report merely stated that “the building is partially ruined” without addressing concerns like structural instability or chemical hazards. No actions have been taken so far.\n\n1. The grievance was closed by the Joint Director's office without verifying if the Panchayat's response addressed the concerns or if any appropriate action was taken.\n\n1. When approached, the Panchayat, the officials said that the Panchayat isn’t responsible for stopping businesses from operating in unsafe premises, but they didn’t clarify which authority is.\n\nI’m not sure what to do next. I’ve contacted multiple authorities, but no action has been taken so far.\n\nMy questions:\n\n* Which authority is responsible for preventing businesses from operating in unsafe buildings in Kerala?\n\n* Should this be escalated to any higher authority?\n\n* Is there any foul play happening? Is that the reason no authority is taking any action?\n\n* How can I ensure that this matter is taken seriously and that action is initiated?\n\nI will attach photos of the burnt building for reference. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!\n\n ",

Since then, I have not gotten my car back. It’s been almost 9 months, and dealing with Zoomcar has been a nightmare.\n\nAfter repeated attempts to get in touch, their lawyer finally called me and informed me that my car has been impounded by the Bihar police. Apparently, the person who rented my car used it to smuggle a huge quantity of alcohol. Since the smuggler wasn’t caught during the incident, they charged me—the car owner—as an accused.\n\nThe lawyer told me I need to:\n\nGo to Bihar to get bail for my name.\nFile cases in the civil court, DM court, and then the high court to get my car back.\n\nThey also said Zoomcar cannot help me further.\nI hired a lawyer to handle this, but after 9 months, there has been no progress. This situation has taken a massive toll on my mental health. My family, work, and studies are all suffering, and I’m experiencing severe anxiety and depression because of this ordeal.\n\nI feel completely helpless and stuck. Has anyone faced a similar issue or can guide me on what to do next? Are there any legal steps I can take against Zoomcar for their negligence or lack of support?\n\nAny advice or suggestions would mean the world to me. Thank you in advance!\n",

I’ve marked the old wire line with ----. Now, our neighbor also wants to shift the poles to the end of their land along the highway. The last two poles are on our land, forming a straight line perpendicular to the road.\n\nThey are saying it won’t be possible without our cooperation (but I know that even if we don’t shift our pole, which is already on our land away from the highway, the second pole near the highway is in the right place). We can't refuse outright because we live in a village and are expected to cooperate.\n\nThe issue is the total cost. The electricity department has quoted around **₹3.5 lakhs** for the shift. They say we will get an official receipt from the government. Since the poles are on the land of three families (including ours), our share of the cost would be around **₹1.2 lakhs**.\n\nI want to understand the process for this:\n\n1. Can they charge this much?\n2. Is it true that the electricity department installs new poles when shifting old ones?\n\n**Other info:**\n\n* **State**: Uk\n* Why shift - We currently have no problem with the poles being on our land since the area is used for farming. However, some neighbors have built buildings nearby, so they are the ones who want this shift.\n* The poles don’t supply electricity to the village (not sure), but I think they are primarily for factories using high-voltage lines.",

        "selftext": "We are a Muslim family from Maharashtra, and I am sharing my sister’s painful story. She was married in 2020 through an arranged marriage. The groom’s family seemed educated but turned out to be extremely controlling and orthodox. From the very first day, my sister faced mental and physical abuse.\n\nHere’s what she went through:\n\n1. **No Freedom from Day One:** On the first day after her wedding, her in-laws took away her phone and sent it back to us. When she asked her husband, he told her that daughters-in-law in their house are not allowed to have phones and she should use his phone instead. To avoid arguments, my sister gave up her phone and her connection to the outside world.\n2. **Total Control Over Her Life:** Her in-laws controlled everything—what she wore, who she talked to, what she ate, even how and when she laughed.\n3. **No Respect in Her Marriage:** Her husband ignored her completely. He spent most of his time with a girl named \"Gudiya,\" who lived with the family but wasn’t related to them. Shockingly, they even shared my sister’s bed while she was forced to sleep on the floor. He avoided talking to her and came home late at night to avoid any confrontation.\n4. **Her Career Dreams Crushed:** My sister is highly qualified (MA in Geography and B.Ed) and wanted to become a professor. Her husband was also a teacher before their marriage, so we thought he would support her dreams. But after marriage, she found out he had quit his job because his mother told him to. When she tried to prepare for exams like NET/SET, her sister-in-law created drama and stopped her from studying.\n5. **No Healthcare or Basic Dignity:** If she fell sick, she was mocked for being weak. They refused to take her to the doctor unless her condition was serious.\n6. **Gold and Dowry Demands:** Her in-laws constantly praised their elder daughter-in-law for bringing dowry and gold every month. They took all the gold my sister brought with her and kept it in a bank without her consent.\n\nShe silently endured this abuse for two years before finally telling us everything. We immediately filed a domestic violence case against her in-laws and husband.\n\n**Legal Struggles**\n\nSince filing the case, her in-laws have avoided every court hearing by manipulating the police and the system. Over a year has passed, and they haven’t attended a single hearing. Meanwhile, my sister has to go to every hearing, reliving her trauma.\n\nEven when a non-bailable warrant was issued, they managed to escape. Their lawyer even got permission for them to skip court appearances. The judge handling the case seems hesitant to take any action, leaving my sister stuck.\n\nTo make things worse, during this time, her husband secretly married another woman without my sister’s consent. While he lives happily, my sister is left to deal with endless legal battles and mental pain.\n\nWe once thought of settling the matter out of court to get her a divorce, but her in-laws refused. They want to “set an example” for other daughters-in-law, showing what happens if they speak out.\n\n**We are desperate for help.** All we want is for my sister to get a divorce and move on with her life.\n\n**Questions We Need Help With:**\n\n1. How can we speed up the court process and make sure her in-laws and husband are held responsible?\n2. What legal steps can we take to secure a divorce and protect her future?\n3. How do we fight the manipulation of the police and courts by her in-laws?\n4. Can stricter action be taken against her husband for marrying another woman without her consent?\n\nPlease help us. My sister deserves a chance to live her life with dignity and hope.",

I confirmed with him today if he submitted and paid the fees in total. He said yes.\n\nBecause of this delay, we are unable to sell the office. In such a situation, does the buyer have a right to cancel the purchase although the property has been registered? Also, two companies refused to rent the office because we didn't have a khata.",

There was some advance money paid out by the builder and there was no development started by the developer in a long time. Since XYZ had no employment, they took out several more advances throughout the years from the said builder, now 20 years later, there is still no development and even though we’re willing to pay the money back (even with interest) the developer isn’t make any progress. \n\nWhat can we do in this situation? \n\nThis has been going on since I was a kid and now I earn quite well and I want to help my dad using some money I can spend.

        "selftext": "Hi,   \n  \nI want to know certain things. I have been living in rent in a property managed by The Helloworld Coliving in Mumbai. I am facing a fundamental necessity issue, which is drinking water, for which they were supposed to put up a water purifier on the property. They provide water that the property's caretaker refills from another property, and a 20ltr can be used for five people. I have faced multiple issues, such as   \n1. Refilling the water from my friend's place.   \n2. No water available in the middle of the night  \n3. The caretaker not being available to get water, which I have to purchase from Blinkit  \n  \nI had raised multiple complaints with their support team, but they closed the ticket without providing an update or getting a customer response. Their customer service number is provided on the website. I called multiple times, but no one answered the calls. Sometimes, someone responded, but they lack basic essentialnication and accountability. \n\nThe biggest culprit is the property manager; I am sure he has never visited the property. He does most of his work via phone like a mafia boss. Most of the time, he has made false promises and no accountability. Whenever an issue is raised in a call, he gives vague timelines like \"it will be done\". And the biggest irony is that there is only one property manager for the entire location. The support team mainly contacts the property manager to resolve tickets. IItis like a Ponzi scheme where the issue goes completely unheard. I am paying 30k as rent for one single room; I mean, there is a TV, a F#\\*\\*ING TV in the amenities, which is entirely useless but no Water Purifier. The management should be pretty dumb and lame to come up with this.\n\n  \nNow the reason I am facing eviction is I have already mentioned to the support team on email that I will be withholding my rent payment until my issue is fixed which they don't seem to care about as they closed those support tickets which I have raised saying the issue has been fixed but in ground reality nothing's been done. I am clear that when I signed the agreement Water Purifer was part of the amenities that they were supposed to provide. What should I do in this case?",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI need some legal advice regarding a complicated situation.\n\nBackground: I come from a lower-income family. My mother left me immediately when I was born due to psychiatric issues and has lived with her parents for over 25 years. Dad tried applying for divorce, but with no address, no answer or response, he didn't get the divorce. I grew up with my father’s parents, who passed away in 2018.\n\nAfter 15+ years of waiting, My dad (58) found a live-in partner in 2010 who agreed to live without divorce or marriage initially.. She (40) a divorcee with two kids from her first marriage. She didn't tell anything and all lies about her first husband being drunkard and so on. \nThings went downhill quickly with her living in my home— within 1 month my grandparents started losing things, theft, bad behavior, and targeting on property. Whenever dad is at home she acts like an angel with me and grandparents.\n\nGrandparents kicked her out within 1 month and my dad and she have lived separately since 2012 in a rented home.\n\nI am disabled and 90% deaf, and I live in the house my grandparents built in Bangalore. My dad visits daily to help me out with household chores.\n\nIn 2015, dad discovered she had an affair in her first marriage that led to her divorce. Even with dad she had affairs late night talks and dad once caught a guy in home when she was alone. She just brushed it off saying friends. \n\nIn 2017, she had lung cancer, which she made my dad financially supported for operation and recovery.\n\nIn 2018, she had medical treatment to conceive again and ended up having a child without my dad’s decision as well. We don't even know if the kid belongs to dad. She hid this news until the 6th month.\n\nIn 2021, they had a violent fight, leading to police involvement. She took the child and ran to Kerala. She’s using the child to emotionally blackmail dad and has sent legal notices to my address claiming dowry and demanding to live in my home. Despite her issues, people seem to side with her. She tried to barge into my home and dad tried to push her out, leading to my name being included in an FIR.\n\nNow, in 2025, a similar fight happened in their rental home and police were called again.\n\nShe’s sending more legal notices through lawyers in Kerala and demands my dad appear before the Kerala Vanitha Committee on a date. \nThis notice came through my home address and dad unknowingly signed and took the letter, later he was regretting he should not have taken in my home address. \n\nThe latest issue is that she wants to live in my home, as my dad has no income.\nAnd she wants dad to marry her in order to see the child or to be in peace, else she would work on creating issues. \n\nMy dad has a small 1BHK near Electronic City around agricultural land, but she refuses to live there and insists on coming to my home.\n\nShe is also trying to involve me in all this and I suspect she'll again try to enter my home forcefully to live in.\n\nI’m already struggling with my disability unable to work effectively, lost my future, and finances aspects, and now the added legal fees and headache are difficult to pay. \n\nMy home is still in my grandparents' name, and I need to settle a amount as per will with my dad's sister to own it in my name which i am yet to do. \n\nWhat can I legally do to stop her from sending these notices and pulling me into this mess?\nCan i send a return notice to not disturb me and my dad does not stay here in my home? \n\nI don’t want her to stay in my home. Should I send a response to the lawyer stating my dad doesn’t live with me full-time? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nI’m also worried for my dad, who is 58 and having knee issues and worsening health not sure what kind of trouble will he be in. \nHow can i help my dad here. I know he did msny mistakes. But he supports me and understand my issues and try to help me as much as possible. \n\nI have no one to approach or ask for help, no relatives would come in for help unless there is a death. ",

Around the same time, my sister's old friend who had a new Instagram account also messaged her. We didn't know it was a friend. We thought it was one of the miscreants. Some rude messages were exchanged and then that person (friend) stopped. \n1. We filed an FIR against all the 4 anonymous Insta accounts. \n1. The police got their real names from Meta company. \n1. We also managed to get the names of the account owners from the cops. 2 people who had a quarrel with my sister and 1 old friend (that's how we came to know about the friend's new account). \n1. The friend also got a call from the police and then called us to explain. \n\nSo now, we have a situation where we named an friendly innocent person (along with the real culprits)  in the FIR. \n\nHow can we resolve the situation with minimum trouble to our friend? We don't want the friend to go through the pain of the legal process. ",

Is there a way to force the company to payup, all they said was operational difficulties and i have it on record. from my understanding i think they couldn't get a lot of people on the plane to make it worth the cost of service, but that's not my problem.I think this is a unique case as i spoke to some of the staff and they said not many people had any other flights from flying plans from aizawl",

        "selftext": "\n\nI need advice regarding my eligibility for a teaching post and whether I should pursue a court case to claim the position. Here’s my situation:\n\n1. Background:\n\nI applied for a teaching post where the notification mentioned that only candidates with a B.Ed. in Special Education are eligible.\n\nHowever, I knew the qualifications mentioned in the notification were incomplete because, based on past vacancies, candidates with a graduation + special diploma (recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India, RCI) were also eligible.\n\nThe RCI is the only body authorized to decide eligibility criteria for such posts, not the government.\n\n\n\n2. My Qualifications at the Time:\n\nI had a special diploma and was pursuing my graduation. However, my graduation was incomplete at the time of application.\n\nDespite this, I filled out the form, sat for the exam, and scored more than 20 marks above the cutoff (in the 2x result list).\n\n\n\n3. Current Scenario:\n\nI did not attend document verification because I had not completed my graduation by the last date of application, as per the notification’s criteria. , also government was only allowing special bed candidates\n\nMeanwhile, the government sought clarification from the RCI regarding qualifications, and the RCI confirmed that diploma holders (like me) are also valid for the post.\n\nAnd after 6-8 months due to some answers get changed, 2x result was canceled, and a new, fresh result was released today. My roll number is still in this list.\n\n\n\n4. Dilemma:\n\nThe notification clearly stated that all qualifications must be completed by the last date of application, which I did not meet.\n\nHowever, I believe I am eligible for the post based on RCI's clarification and past precedence.\n\nI desperately need this job, and I worked incredibly hard for it.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\nDo I have a strong case if I file a court petition?\n\nWhat legal arguments can I make to strengthen my case?\n\nAre there any past judgments or legal principles that could support my claim?\n\n\nI understand my chances might be slim, but I want to explore all possible options. Your guidance would mean a lot to me.\n\nThank you!\n\n.\n\n",

Unfortunately, all the items had some issue or the other in terms of size and fit so I decided to return it. I raised a request to return the items on 30th Dec and my order was picked up by a Delhivery guy on 31st Dec 2024. The person who picked it up was behaving very strangely. As he went through each item to confirm everything was there with all tags intact, he kept asking me the total value of the order and saying \"Ye order toh kaafi mehenga hoga na madam?\" \nI didn't respond and asked him to verify if it was him who was supposed to pick it up. And he said yes and that it was his first day of work so he is new to all this. I verified his phone number from the Delhivery app and then handed him my entire parcel. I later got an email from Delhivery that day that my order was picked up. \n\nOn 3rd Jan 2025, I received and email from Delhivery that my parcel was returned to Zara warehouse. Usually, when we return items to Zara, we get an email from them confirming that they have received it and the refund will be processed. I kept waiting for that email but didn't get one. I contacted Zara's customer service on 10th Jan 2025 and they told me they had only received one sweater in the parcel and it was a non-Zara item so they will not be giving me a refund. I have been chasing them ever since through calls every other day and their executives keep telling me to wait for 24-48 hours as my case has been expedited. But it's going to be month since I returned all the items. \n\nI have my suspicions that the Delhivery pickup guy stole my parcel and handed them random item. But I have not even been able to reach out to Delhivery since they deactivate their AWBs within 15 days. And their automated customer service says to contact the seller. And Zara has been utterly useless in those terms. \n\nI really need my money back. \n\nIs this worth filing a case in consumer court? How can we do it? Or is there any other way I can get them to give my refund. ",

        "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nThanks in advance for reading this huge wall of text :)\n\nA family member of mine booked a wedding hall/banquet situated in Sec 56 Gurgaon on July 7th 2024. They paid 90000 as a booking amount of the total Rs 3,15,000 (Food and Venue only, no decoration.). \n\nThey had booked the pool side venue, however at the time of booking, the pool was operational for members and functions were not being conducted. The Salesperson told us that we can come in November to look at their poolside functions to finalize our decoration.\n\nFast forward to end of November, we had not heard anything from the sales person, and after following up with her multiple times to give us a time to visit the venue for tasting and to see the decoration, she finally gave us a date of Dec 4th. She had informed us that there would be a wedding function in the eve of 4th Dec where we can see sample decoration and taste the food. \n\nWhen on Dec 4th we reached the venue, it was in an ABYSSMAL condition. It looked like they were taking apart the decoration instead of putting it up. Keep in mind that we went there at 8 pm, and the wedding guests had almost started to arrive. \n\nThe entire venue was covered in used straws and disposable spoons/plates, maybe from the day before function and nobody had bothered cleaning it up. The sofa for the bride and groom was dirty and torn and had food/stains marks all over. The low chairs for the bride and groom during pheras, were dirty, and had holes in them. Without getting into more details, it was a very horrible setup.\n\nNow based on all of this, we decided to confront the sales lady (who had been trying to avoid us the entire time btw), and we told them to cancel the venue. \n\nWe had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. With to and fro with the venue management, we were able to get them to send an email to us stating that they will refund \"the amount that we paid at the time of booking\" and that we can expect the refund in 3rd week of January 2025. \n\nHowever, since passing of 3rd week of Jan 2025, they have stopped responding and keep saying that they will send a final date soon. \n\nTldr: A family member booked a poolside wedding venue in Sec 56, Gurgaon, for July 7, 2024, paying ₹90,000 upfront (total ₹3,15,000). The salesperson promised a visit in November to view decorations and food tasting, but after delays, they finally scheduled it for Dec 4. Upon visiting, the venue was in terrible condition—dirty, torn furniture, and no proper setup despite an ongoing event. The family decided to cancel, however they had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. Upon negotiations, the family got an email confirmation of a refund with the venue management. The venue promised a refund by mid-Jan 2025 but has since stopped responding and delayed giving a final refund date. \n\nWhat legal steps can the family take to recover this amount? \n\n",

It’s going to be little long but he actually needs help so please read\n\nHe met a girl in 2019 they fell in love and started living together later he got to know that she was married but she said they got divorced and he trusted her! Then 6 months into the relationship she was after him to get married within 5-10 days as her mother was sick and there won’t be any auspicious day after 30th of some month i don’t remember. He tried to explain her that marriage doesn’t happen quickly and he doesn’t earn enough to be married and he also want big wedding someday! But she kept forcing him by saying I don’t care about big wedding i want small wedding!\nIt was just after lockdown and they got married in Arya samaj.\n\nAfter 1 year of marriage she started behaving controlling like leave your friends stay home with me all the time! Mind that she was 5-6 years older to him, he didn’t want to leave his friends and wanted to drink occasionally  with his friends but whenever he made plans she threatened him by saying i will jump from the building or i will cut my hand!\n\nBefore this threatening happened, my friend bought a house on his name and made his wife the nominee! But later on he could not take all this and he ran off!\n\nIt’s been 3 years since he has left his own home! She took all the stuff from the house which had some very expensive stuff also! She took property papers too which is in her bank locker! \n\nWhen she didn’t respond to mutual divorce! My friend met a girl and have been living with her and wants to marry her so he decided to talk to an advocate! Now he got to know she was married before but never divorced her first husband! Lawyer told him if my friend wants to marry again he can but he needs to forget about his own house any all the stuff including money in joint account with her!\n\nNow finally his wife filled a complaint saying he tortured her basically 498 or something! And she also included his mother and sister in it when he has been living away from family for past 11 years and she met the family twice only that too for lunch or dinner only!\n\nSo he wants to know that she can take away his home and joint account money? Which is his only asset as his family doesn’t talk to him and have nothing else. And as she is not divorced before so can she still claim everything ?",

If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.\"\n\nIt's not even due to outside damage or misuse which they mention in their warranty terms, it's literally the cheap quality of plastic used in the headband. Also if it's not covered under the warranty claim, then why replace them for customers outside of India? This is a well known defect and they've very much acknowledged it in the past as well, I am positively mystified at this remark.\n\nIs there something I can do legally to get them to honor this warranty claim?

She discovered that massive, decades-old trees on the school campus had been cut down.\n\n\n2. The school headmaster had permission to cut only one dead/dried-out tree and this was done by the concerned authorities by following the procedure few days back\n\n\n3. But yesterday (26/1/25) me and my mom saw that the headmaster has illegally cut two healthy trees without proper authorization (she wasn't present at the sight) and we have a video evidence of the man admitting that the headmaster has payed him to cut.\n\n\n4. The wood from these trees is very valuable and is intended for personal profit.\n\n\n5. As per procedure, tree-felling requires permission from BBMP or the Karnataka Forest Department, who also handle the cutting and removal process. This wasn’t followed.\n\n\n6. My mother recorded videos of the site as evidence and is considering filing a complaint.\n\n\n\nMy Concerns:\n\nIf my mother or I escalate this (e.g., filing a complaint or posting on Twitter), could we face any legal trouble or retaliation from the school/headmaster?\n\nIs there any other legal procedure or body we should approach to address this?\n\n\nKey Questions for Advice:\n\n1. What are the potential legal risks for us if we take this forward?\n\n\n2. What steps should we take to ensure this is handled legally and safely?\n\n\n3. Is there any way to ensure anonymity for my mother while filing the complaint? I'm planning to post this on X(twitter) since benguluru police are active there from what I know ",

        "selftext": "This post is based on my understanding of the **Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill, 2024**. If there are any mistakes or inaccuracies, please let me know in the comments! I'm happy to learn and discuss. 😊\n\n# Uttarakhand Implements Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in 2024\n\nThe Uttarakhand government has introduced the **Uniform Civil Code (UCC)**, making it the first Indian state to adopt a unified legal framework for all its residents. This law simplifies and regulates matters like **marriage, divorce, inheritance**, and **live-in relationships**, ensuring everyone is treated equally under the same set of laws, regardless of their religion or cultural practices.\n\n# Key Points of the UCC\n\n1. **Marriage Rules:**\n   * Both partners must be **unmarried** at the time of marriage.\n   * Minimum age for marriage: **21 years for men, 18 years for women.**\n   * Marriage between close relatives (prohibited relationships) is not allowed unless permitted by specific customs, and those customs must not go against public policy.\n2. **Polygamy Banned:**\n   * Polygamy is **prohibited for everyone**, including communities where it was previously allowed (e.g., Muslim personal laws).\n   * Only **monogamous marriages** will be legally valid under the UCC.\n3. **Mandatory Marriage Registration:**\n   * Every marriage, even if solemnized outside Uttarakhand, must be registered with the authorities if at least one partner is a resident of the state.\n   * Marriages conducted since **2010** must also be registered retroactively.\n4. **Live-in Relationships:**\n   * Couples in live-in relationships must register their partnership within **30 days** of living together.\n   * **Children born from live-in relationships are considered legitimate** and will have inheritance rights.\n   * Women deserted by live-in partners can claim **financial support (maintenance)** through the courts.\n5. **Equal Inheritance Rights:**\n   * Both sons and daughters are given **equal inheritance rights** to their parents’ property, ensuring gender equality.\n6. **Religious Freedom for Ceremonies:**\n   * Couples can marry following their own religious or customary traditions, such as **Saptapadi, Nikah, Holy Union**, or **Anand Karaj.**\n\n# Who Does It Apply To?\n\n* The UCC applies to **all residents of Uttarakhand**, even those living outside the state.\n* **Scheduled Tribes** and groups with **protected customary practices** under the Constitution are exempt from this Code.\n\n# What Changes Under the UCC?\n\nThe UCC replaces personal laws based on religion with a **common set of rules** for everyone. For example:\n\n* Practices like **polygamy** are no longer allowed.\n* There is now a standardized procedure for marriage, divorce, and property inheritance.\n* Women in both marriages and live-in relationships have clear legal protections.\n\nFINE AND IMPRISONMENT \n\n* Under the Uttarakhand UCC, 2024, failing to submit a live-in relationship statement can result in:\n\nFine: Up to ₹10,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 3 months.\n\nProviding false information or ignoring notices can lead to stricter penalties, including:\n\nFine: Up to ₹25,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 6 months.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI need assistance with a passport issue for my father. The problem is related to a name correction in his passport application. Here’s the situation:\n\n* My father already has a passport, but it expired 5 years ago.\n* He renewed his passport in 2009, and at that time, due to a misunderstanding, his name was recorded incorrectly. Specifically, his grandfather’s name (father's father's name) was included, resulting in a trimmed/abbreviated version of his actual name.\n* Now, his old passport has a name that doesn’t match his Aadhaar card or other documents.\n\nWe recently applied for a passport renewal and visited the Passport Seva Kendra with all the necessary documents for a name correction. However, the officer in charge put the application on hold and insisted that we update the name on his Aadhaar card to match the old passport.\n\nWhile changing the name on the Aadhaar card is possible, it would create a ripple effect, as many other documents (bank accounts, property papers, etc.) are linked to the current name on his Aadhaar. This is the name we prefer to maintain, as it’s consistent across all other documents.\n\nOur goal is to correct the name in the passport to match the Aadhaar card, rather than changing the Aadhaar card to match the old passport. Is there any way to achieve this? Has anyone faced a similar situation or have advice on how to resolve this issue?\n\nAny guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\n",

It’s in an unsafe condition, with structural instability, burnt debris, and residual oil spills. Despite this, the previous tenant is trying to resume operations there, posing serious risks to public safety.\n\nHere’s what has happened so far:\n\n1. A grievance was filed with the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office, and the issue was forwarded to the District Joint Director (LSGD) and then to the Panchayat.\n\n1. The Panchayat’s investigation report merely stated that “the building is partially ruined” without addressing concerns like structural instability or chemical hazards. No actions have been taken so far.\n\n1. The grievance was closed by the Joint Director's office without verifying if the Panchayat's response addressed the concerns or if any appropriate action was taken.\n\n1. When approached, the Panchayat, the officials said that the Panchayat isn’t responsible for stopping businesses from operating in unsafe premises, but they didn’t clarify which authority is.\n\nI’m not sure what to do next. I’ve contacted multiple authorities, but no action has been taken so far.\n\nMy questions:\n\n* Which authority is responsible for preventing businesses from operating in unsafe buildings in Kerala?\n\n* Should this be escalated to any higher authority?\n\n* Is there any foul play happening? Is that the reason no authority is taking any action?\n\n* How can I ensure that this matter is taken seriously and that action is initiated?\n\nI will attach photos of the burnt building for reference. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!\n\n ",

Since then, I have not gotten my car back. It’s been almost 9 months, and dealing with Zoomcar has been a nightmare.\n\nAfter repeated attempts to get in touch, their lawyer finally called me and informed me that my car has been impounded by the Bihar police. Apparently, the person who rented my car used it to smuggle a huge quantity of alcohol. Since the smuggler wasn’t caught during the incident, they charged me—the car owner—as an accused.\n\nThe lawyer told me I need to:\n\nGo to Bihar to get bail for my name.\nFile cases in the civil court, DM court, and then the high court to get my car back.\n\nThey also said Zoomcar cannot help me further.\nI hired a lawyer to handle this, but after 9 months, there has been no progress. This situation has taken a massive toll on my mental health. My family, work, and studies are all suffering, and I’m experiencing severe anxiety and depression because of this ordeal.\n\nI feel completely helpless and stuck. Has anyone faced a similar issue or can guide me on what to do next? Are there any legal steps I can take against Zoomcar for their negligence or lack of support?\n\nAny advice or suggestions would mean the world to me. Thank you in advance!\n",

Since the poles are on the land of three families (including ours), our share of the cost would be around **₹1.2 lakhs**.\n\nI want to understand the process for this:\n\n1. Can they charge this much?\n2. Is it true that the electricity department installs new poles when shifting old ones?\n\n**Other info:**\n\n* **State**: Uk\n* Why shift - We currently have no problem with the poles being on our land since the area is used for farming. However, some neighbors have built buildings nearby, so they are the ones who want this shift.\n* The poles don’t supply electricity to the village (not sure), but I think they are primarily for factories using high-voltage lines.",

For some time the old ladies have not been able to sit in the 'favorite spot' because the tall Neem trees don't let the sunset sunlight reach them in the evening. Also another family who moved in 2 years ago and started planting his home garden in the common area has been unhappy with the Neem trees because his plants don't get direct sunlight. \nBoth parties have made multiple attempts to have the trees cut down. Once we even had to fight the family because the resident was literally up on a neem tree and cutting a branch himself. \nTurns out the MCF guys visited today (not sure if this is true), and said they need to cut some branches because they are touching the electricity grid wires. Well, okay. Assuming it is true, fine. \nBUT. \nThey have CLEARLY CUT SO MUCH MORE THAN NECESSARY. TREES THAT DID NOT EVEN HAVE ANY BRANCHES TOUCHING OR NEAR THE WIRES HAVE BEEN CUT DOWN. \nI spoke to the people cutting it down and they said that some was for the MCF work, but the society families have also come and requested them to cut extra without telling anyone. \n\nWhat can I do here? \n\nIt's painful to see. It's so incredibly wrong. 20+ years of strong, beautiful, lush green trees just cut down. These stupid men and women don't realise that these very trees provided shade in summers, which are increasingly unbearable each year. \n\nI want to slap some legal on the society management so that they know things dont go without consequences. Please help in case anyone has an idea. Thanks a lot in advance. ",

        "selftext": "We are a Muslim family from Maharashtra, and I am sharing my sister’s painful story. She was married in 2020 through an arranged marriage. The groom’s family seemed educated but turned out to be extremely controlling and orthodox. From the very first day, my sister faced mental and physical abuse.\n\nHere’s what she went through:\n\n1. **No Freedom from Day One:** On the first day after her wedding, her in-laws took away her phone and sent it back to us. When she asked her husband, he told her that daughters-in-law in their house are not allowed to have phones and she should use his phone instead. To avoid arguments, my sister gave up her phone and her connection to the outside world.\n2. **Total Control Over Her Life:** Her in-laws controlled everything—what she wore, who she talked to, what she ate, even how and when she laughed.\n3. **No Respect in Her Marriage:** Her husband ignored her completely. He spent most of his time with a girl named \"Gudiya,\" who lived with the family but wasn’t related to them. Shockingly, they even shared my sister’s bed while she was forced to sleep on the floor. He avoided talking to her and came home late at night to avoid any confrontation.\n4. **Her Career Dreams Crushed:** My sister is highly qualified (MA in Geography and B.Ed) and wanted to become a professor. Her husband was also a teacher before their marriage, so we thought he would support her dreams. But after marriage, she found out he had quit his job because his mother told him to. When she tried to prepare for exams like NET/SET, her sister-in-law created drama and stopped her from studying.\n5. **No Healthcare or Basic Dignity:** If she fell sick, she was mocked for being weak. They refused to take her to the doctor unless her condition was serious.\n6. **Gold and Dowry Demands:** Her in-laws constantly praised their elder daughter-in-law for bringing dowry and gold every month. They took all the gold my sister brought with her and kept it in a bank without her consent.\n\nShe silently endured this abuse for two years before finally telling us everything. We immediately filed a domestic violence case against her in-laws and husband.\n\n**Legal Struggles**\n\nSince filing the case, her in-laws have avoided every court hearing by manipulating the police and the system. Over a year has passed, and they haven’t attended a single hearing. Meanwhile, my sister has to go to every hearing, reliving her trauma.\n\nEven when a non-bailable warrant was issued, they managed to escape. Their lawyer even got permission for them to skip court appearances. The judge handling the case seems hesitant to take any action, leaving my sister stuck.\n\nTo make things worse, during this time, her husband secretly married another woman without my sister’s consent. While he lives happily, my sister is left to deal with endless legal battles and mental pain.\n\nWe once thought of settling the matter out of court to get her a divorce, but her in-laws refused. They want to “set an example” for other daughters-in-law, showing what happens if they speak out.\n\n**We are desperate for help.** All we want is for my sister to get a divorce and move on with her life.\n\n**Questions We Need Help With:**\n\n1. How can we speed up the court process and make sure her in-laws and husband are held responsible?\n2. What legal steps can we take to secure a divorce and protect her future?\n3. How do we fight the manipulation of the police and courts by her in-laws?\n4. Can stricter action be taken against her husband for marrying another woman without her consent?\n\nPlease help us. My sister deserves a chance to live her life with dignity and hope.",

There was some advance money paid out by the builder and there was no development started by the developer in a long time. Since XYZ had no employment, they took out several more advances throughout the years from the said builder, now 20 years later, there is still no development and even though we’re willing to pay the money back (even with interest) the developer isn’t make any progress. \n\nWhat can we do in this situation? \n\nThis has been going on since I was a kid and now I earn quite well and I want to help my dad using some money I can spend.

        "selftext": "Hi,   \n  \nI want to know certain things. I have been living in rent in a property managed by The Helloworld Coliving in Mumbai. I am facing a fundamental necessity issue, which is drinking water, for which they were supposed to put up a water purifier on the property. They provide water that the property's caretaker refills from another property, and a 20ltr can be used for five people. I have faced multiple issues, such as   \n1. Refilling the water from my friend's place.   \n2. No water available in the middle of the night  \n3. The caretaker not being available to get water, which I have to purchase from Blinkit  \n  \nI had raised multiple complaints with their support team, but they closed the ticket without providing an update or getting a customer response. Their customer service number is provided on the website. I called multiple times, but no one answered the calls. Sometimes, someone responded, but they lack basic essentialnication and accountability. \n\nThe biggest culprit is the property manager; I am sure he has never visited the property. He does most of his work via phone like a mafia boss. Most of the time, he has made false promises and no accountability. Whenever an issue is raised in a call, he gives vague timelines like \"it will be done\". And the biggest irony is that there is only one property manager for the entire location. The support team mainly contacts the property manager to resolve tickets. IItis like a Ponzi scheme where the issue goes completely unheard. I am paying 30k as rent for one single room; I mean, there is a TV, a F#\\*\\*ING TV in the amenities, which is entirely useless but no Water Purifier. The management should be pretty dumb and lame to come up with this.\n\n  \nNow the reason I am facing eviction is I have already mentioned to the support team on email that I will be withholding my rent payment until my issue is fixed which they don't seem to care about as they closed those support tickets which I have raised saying the issue has been fixed but in ground reality nothing's been done. I am clear that when I signed the agreement Water Purifer was part of the amenities that they were supposed to provide. What should I do in this case?",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI need some legal advice regarding a complicated situation.\n\nBackground: I come from a lower-income family. My mother left me immediately when I was born due to psychiatric issues and has lived with her parents for over 25 years. Dad tried applying for divorce, but with no address, no answer or response, he didn't get the divorce. I grew up with my father’s parents, who passed away in 2018.\n\nAfter 15+ years of waiting, My dad (58) found a live-in partner in 2010 who agreed to live without divorce or marriage initially.. She (40) a divorcee with two kids from her first marriage. She didn't tell anything and all lies about her first husband being drunkard and so on. \nThings went downhill quickly with her living in my home— within 1 month my grandparents started losing things, theft, bad behavior, and targeting on property. Whenever dad is at home she acts like an angel with me and grandparents.\n\nGrandparents kicked her out within 1 month and my dad and she have lived separately since 2012 in a rented home.\n\nI am disabled and 90% deaf, and I live in the house my grandparents built in Bangalore. My dad visits daily to help me out with household chores.\n\nIn 2015, dad discovered she had an affair in her first marriage that led to her divorce. Even with dad she had affairs late night talks and dad once caught a guy in home when she was alone. She just brushed it off saying friends. \n\nIn 2017, she had lung cancer, which she made my dad financially supported for operation and recovery.\n\nIn 2018, she had medical treatment to conceive again and ended up having a child without my dad’s decision as well. We don't even know if the kid belongs to dad. She hid this news until the 6th month.\n\nIn 2021, they had a violent fight, leading to police involvement. She took the child and ran to Kerala. She’s using the child to emotionally blackmail dad and has sent legal notices to my address claiming dowry and demanding to live in my home. Despite her issues, people seem to side with her. She tried to barge into my home and dad tried to push her out, leading to my name being included in an FIR.\n\nNow, in 2025, a similar fight happened in their rental home and police were called again.\n\nShe’s sending more legal notices through lawyers in Kerala and demands my dad appear before the Kerala Vanitha Committee on a date. \nThis notice came through my home address and dad unknowingly signed and took the letter, later he was regretting he should not have taken in my home address. \n\nThe latest issue is that she wants to live in my home, as my dad has no income.\nAnd she wants dad to marry her in order to see the child or to be in peace, else she would work on creating issues. \n\nMy dad has a small 1BHK near Electronic City around agricultural land, but she refuses to live there and insists on coming to my home.\n\nShe is also trying to involve me in all this and I suspect she'll again try to enter my home forcefully to live in.\n\nI’m already struggling with my disability unable to work effectively, lost my future, and finances aspects, and now the added legal fees and headache are difficult to pay. \n\nMy home is still in my grandparents' name, and I need to settle a amount as per will with my dad's sister to own it in my name which i am yet to do. \n\nWhat can I legally do to stop her from sending these notices and pulling me into this mess?\nCan i send a return notice to not disturb me and my dad does not stay here in my home? \n\nI don’t want her to stay in my home. Should I send a response to the lawyer stating my dad doesn’t live with me full-time? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nI’m also worried for my dad, who is 58 and having knee issues and worsening health not sure what kind of trouble will he be in. \nHow can i help my dad here. I know he did msny mistakes. But he supports me and understand my issues and try to help me as much as possible. \n\nI have no one to approach or ask for help, no relatives would come in for help unless there is a death. ",

Some miscreants edited and leaked explicit pics of my sister. They also sent the images to us for blackmail. They messaged us using anonymous Instagram accounts. \n1. We tried to talk them out of it but they didn't respond positively. \n1. Since my sister was stressed, we were looking after her Insta account. \n1. Around the same time, my sister's old friend who had a new Instagram account also messaged her. We didn't know it was a friend. We thought it was one of the miscreants. Some rude messages were exchanged and then that person (friend) stopped. \n1. We filed an FIR against all the 4 anonymous Insta accounts. \n1. The police got their real names from Meta company. \n1. We also managed to get the names of the account owners from the cops. 2 people who had a quarrel with my sister and 1 old friend (that's how we came to know about the friend's new account). \n1. The friend also got a call from the police and then called us to explain. \n\nSo now, we have a situation where we named an friendly innocent person (along with the real culprits)  in the FIR. \n\nHow can we resolve the situation with minimum trouble to our friend? We don't want the friend to go through the pain of the legal process. ",

I know that i will get a refund but the it was imperative that i had to travel to the aizawl as my returning flight to bengaluru was on the 26th, and i could not miss this.\n\nNow, other than the ticket refund, how can i remake the loss of 18K, i am at the moment broke and in debt to a friend. Is there a way to force the company to payup, all they said was operational difficulties and i have it on record. from my understanding i think they couldn't get a lot of people on the plane to make it worth the cost of service, but that's not my problem.I think this is a unique case as i spoke to some of the staff and they said not many people had any other flights from flying plans from aizawl",

        "selftext": "\n\nI need advice regarding my eligibility for a teaching post and whether I should pursue a court case to claim the position. Here’s my situation:\n\n1. Background:\n\nI applied for a teaching post where the notification mentioned that only candidates with a B.Ed. in Special Education are eligible.\n\nHowever, I knew the qualifications mentioned in the notification were incomplete because, based on past vacancies, candidates with a graduation + special diploma (recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India, RCI) were also eligible.\n\nThe RCI is the only body authorized to decide eligibility criteria for such posts, not the government.\n\n\n\n2. My Qualifications at the Time:\n\nI had a special diploma and was pursuing my graduation. However, my graduation was incomplete at the time of application.\n\nDespite this, I filled out the form, sat for the exam, and scored more than 20 marks above the cutoff (in the 2x result list).\n\n\n\n3. Current Scenario:\n\nI did not attend document verification because I had not completed my graduation by the last date of application, as per the notification’s criteria. , also government was only allowing special bed candidates\n\nMeanwhile, the government sought clarification from the RCI regarding qualifications, and the RCI confirmed that diploma holders (like me) are also valid for the post.\n\nAnd after 6-8 months due to some answers get changed, 2x result was canceled, and a new, fresh result was released today. My roll number is still in this list.\n\n\n\n4. Dilemma:\n\nThe notification clearly stated that all qualifications must be completed by the last date of application, which I did not meet.\n\nHowever, I believe I am eligible for the post based on RCI's clarification and past precedence.\n\nI desperately need this job, and I worked incredibly hard for it.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\nDo I have a strong case if I file a court petition?\n\nWhat legal arguments can I make to strengthen my case?\n\nAre there any past judgments or legal principles that could support my claim?\n\n\nI understand my chances might be slim, but I want to explore all possible options. Your guidance would mean a lot to me.\n\nThank you!\n\n.\n\n",

Unfortunately, all the items had some issue or the other in terms of size and fit so I decided to return it. I raised a request to return the items on 30th Dec and my order was picked up by a Delhivery guy on 31st Dec 2024. The person who picked it up was behaving very strangely. As he went through each item to confirm everything was there with all tags intact, he kept asking me the total value of the order and saying \"Ye order toh kaafi mehenga hoga na madam?\" \nI didn't respond and asked him to verify if it was him who was supposed to pick it up. And he said yes and that it was his first day of work so he is new to all this. I verified his phone number from the Delhivery app and then handed him my entire parcel. I later got an email from Delhivery that day that my order was picked up. \n\nOn 3rd Jan 2025, I received and email from Delhivery that my parcel was returned to Zara warehouse. Usually, when we return items to Zara, we get an email from them confirming that they have received it and the refund will be processed. I kept waiting for that email but didn't get one. I contacted Zara's customer service on 10th Jan 2025 and they told me they had only received one sweater in the parcel and it was a non-Zara item so they will not be giving me a refund. I have been chasing them ever since through calls every other day and their executives keep telling me to wait for 24-48 hours as my case has been expedited. But it's going to be month since I returned all the items. \n\nI have my suspicions that the Delhivery pickup guy stole my parcel and handed them random item. But I have not even been able to reach out to Delhivery since they deactivate their AWBs within 15 days. And their automated customer service says to contact the seller. And Zara has been utterly useless in those terms. \n\nI really need my money back. \n\nIs this worth filing a case in consumer court? How can we do it? Or is there any other way I can get them to give my refund. ",

        "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nThanks in advance for reading this huge wall of text :)\n\nA family member of mine booked a wedding hall/banquet situated in Sec 56 Gurgaon on July 7th 2024. They paid 90000 as a booking amount of the total Rs 3,15,000 (Food and Venue only, no decoration.). \n\nThey had booked the pool side venue, however at the time of booking, the pool was operational for members and functions were not being conducted. The Salesperson told us that we can come in November to look at their poolside functions to finalize our decoration.\n\nFast forward to end of November, we had not heard anything from the sales person, and after following up with her multiple times to give us a time to visit the venue for tasting and to see the decoration, she finally gave us a date of Dec 4th. She had informed us that there would be a wedding function in the eve of 4th Dec where we can see sample decoration and taste the food. \n\nWhen on Dec 4th we reached the venue, it was in an ABYSSMAL condition. It looked like they were taking apart the decoration instead of putting it up. Keep in mind that we went there at 8 pm, and the wedding guests had almost started to arrive. \n\nThe entire venue was covered in used straws and disposable spoons/plates, maybe from the day before function and nobody had bothered cleaning it up. The sofa for the bride and groom was dirty and torn and had food/stains marks all over. The low chairs for the bride and groom during pheras, were dirty, and had holes in them. Without getting into more details, it was a very horrible setup.\n\nNow based on all of this, we decided to confront the sales lady (who had been trying to avoid us the entire time btw), and we told them to cancel the venue. \n\nWe had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. With to and fro with the venue management, we were able to get them to send an email to us stating that they will refund \"the amount that we paid at the time of booking\" and that we can expect the refund in 3rd week of January 2025. \n\nHowever, since passing of 3rd week of Jan 2025, they have stopped responding and keep saying that they will send a final date soon. \n\nTldr: A family member booked a poolside wedding venue in Sec 56, Gurgaon, for July 7, 2024, paying ₹90,000 upfront (total ₹3,15,000). The salesperson promised a visit in November to view decorations and food tasting, but after delays, they finally scheduled it for Dec 4. Upon visiting, the venue was in terrible condition—dirty, torn furniture, and no proper setup despite an ongoing event. The family decided to cancel, however they had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. Upon negotiations, the family got an email confirmation of a refund with the venue management. The venue promised a refund by mid-Jan 2025 but has since stopped responding and delayed giving a final refund date. \n\nWhat legal steps can the family take to recover this amount? \n\n",

It’s going to be little long but he actually needs help so please read\n\nHe met a girl in 2019 they fell in love and started living together later he got to know that she was married but she said they got divorced and he trusted her! Then 6 months into the relationship she was after him to get married within 5-10 days as her mother was sick and there won’t be any auspicious day after 30th of some month i don’t remember. He tried to explain her that marriage doesn’t happen quickly and he doesn’t earn enough to be married and he also want big wedding someday! But she kept forcing him by saying I don’t care about big wedding i want small wedding!\nIt was just after lockdown and they got married in Arya samaj.\n\nAfter 1 year of marriage she started behaving controlling like leave your friends stay home with me all the time! Mind that she was 5-6 years older to him, he didn’t want to leave his friends and wanted to drink occasionally  with his friends but whenever he made plans she threatened him by saying i will jump from the building or i will cut my hand!\n\nBefore this threatening happened, my friend bought a house on his name and made his wife the nominee! But later on he could not take all this and he ran off!\n\nIt’s been 3 years since he has left his own home! She took all the stuff from the house which had some very expensive stuff also! She took property papers too which is in her bank locker! \n\nWhen she didn’t respond to mutual divorce! My friend met a girl and have been living with her and wants to marry her so he decided to talk to an advocate! Now he got to know she was married before but never divorced her first husband! Lawyer told him if my friend wants to marry again he can but he needs to forget about his own house any all the stuff including money in joint account with her!\n\nNow finally his wife filled a complaint saying he tortured her basically 498 or something! And she also included his mother and sister in it when he has been living away from family for past 11 years and she met the family twice only that too for lunch or dinner only!\n\nSo he wants to know that she can take away his home and joint account money? Which is his only asset as his family doesn’t talk to him and have nothing else. And as she is not divorced before so can she still claim everything ?",

        "selftext": "I bought a pair of headphones, Soundcore Q30 Life in October last year, and they've been my daily driver for 3 months. And today suddenly the headband cracks near the earmuff. I looked it up and it seems like it's a relatively common QC issue in this particular model. There's plenty of proof here - [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/wx2opz/the_headband_on_my_q30_headphones_broke_after_a/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/lhcei6/soundcore_q30_design_flaw_the_plastic_clips_next/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/xlvwjj/another_broken_soundcore_q30/) [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/187blhc/soundcore_q30_part_broke/) [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/nv4jhk/my_soundcore_q30_broke_always_felt_right_side_was/)\n\nI contacted Anker regarding the 18 Month Warranty claim since a good few people got a new pair after the brittle plastic headband broke the same way, or at least that's what they claimed on their respective reddit threads. I contacted them via email regarding the same and I was shocked by their reply. They said and I quote - \n\n\"I'm sorry to hear about the damage to your product. Unfortunately, according to our policy, we do not provide a warranty if the product is damaged or lost due to improper use. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.\"\n\nIt's not even due to outside damage or misuse which they mention in their warranty terms, it's literally the cheap quality of plastic used in the headband. Also if it's not covered under the warranty claim, then why replace them for customers outside of India? This is a well known defect and they've very much acknowledged it in the past as well, I am positively mystified at this remark.\n\nIs there something I can do legally to get them to honor this warranty claim? Seems like they've shut down my ticket too.",

The school headmaster had permission to cut only one dead/dried-out tree and this was done by the concerned authorities by following the procedure few days back\n\n\n3.

The son is survived by a wife; will the property now be jointly owned by both the mother and the daughter-in-law?\n\n\t2.\tWhen the property was registered, both the son and the mother were listed as joint owners. However, it was mentioned that the registry included a discount due to the woman’s ownership. Does this imply that the registry is in the mother’s name, and that the property will be transferred solely to her?\n\n\t3.\tIf the property is transferred to the mother’s name, does the daughter-in-law have any rights to it?\n\n\t4.\tIf the mother ultimately receives the property, can she transfer it as a gift to her daughter in order to prevent the daughter-in-law from acquiring any rights to it?\n\nLooking forward to any insights!",

        "selftext": "This post is based on my understanding of the **Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill, 2024**. If there are any mistakes or inaccuracies, please let me know in the comments! I'm happy to learn and discuss. 😊\n\n# Uttarakhand Implements Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in 2024\n\nThe Uttarakhand government has introduced the **Uniform Civil Code (UCC)**, making it the first Indian state to adopt a unified legal framework for all its residents. This law simplifies and regulates matters like **marriage, divorce, inheritance**, and **live-in relationships**, ensuring everyone is treated equally under the same set of laws, regardless of their religion or cultural practices.\n\n# Key Points of the UCC\n\n1. **Marriage Rules:**\n   * Both partners must be **unmarried** at the time of marriage.\n   * Minimum age for marriage: **21 years for men, 18 years for women.**\n   * Marriage between close relatives (prohibited relationships) is not allowed unless permitted by specific customs, and those customs must not go against public policy.\n2. **Polygamy Banned:**\n   * Polygamy is **prohibited for everyone**, including communities where it was previously allowed (e.g., Muslim personal laws).\n   * Only **monogamous marriages** will be legally valid under the UCC.\n3. **Mandatory Marriage Registration:**\n   * Every marriage, even if solemnized outside Uttarakhand, must be registered with the authorities if at least one partner is a resident of the state.\n   * Marriages conducted since **2010** must also be registered retroactively.\n4. **Live-in Relationships:**\n   * Couples in live-in relationships must register their partnership within **30 days** of living together.\n   * **Children born from live-in relationships are considered legitimate** and will have inheritance rights.\n   * Women deserted by live-in partners can claim **financial support (maintenance)** through the courts.\n5. **Equal Inheritance Rights:**\n   * Both sons and daughters are given **equal inheritance rights** to their parents’ property, ensuring gender equality.\n6. **Religious Freedom for Ceremonies:**\n   * Couples can marry following their own religious or customary traditions, such as **Saptapadi, Nikah, Holy Union**, or **Anand Karaj.**\n\n# Who Does It Apply To?\n\n* The UCC applies to **all residents of Uttarakhand**, even those living outside the state.\n* **Scheduled Tribes** and groups with **protected customary practices** under the Constitution are exempt from this Code.\n\n# What Changes Under the UCC?\n\nThe UCC replaces personal laws based on religion with a **common set of rules** for everyone. For example:\n\n* Practices like **polygamy** are no longer allowed.\n* There is now a standardized procedure for marriage, divorce, and property inheritance.\n* Women in both marriages and live-in relationships have clear legal protections.\n\nFINE AND IMPRISONMENT \n\n* Under the Uttarakhand UCC, 2024, failing to submit a live-in relationship statement can result in:\n\nFine: Up to ₹10,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 3 months.\n\nProviding false information or ignoring notices can lead to stricter penalties, including:\n\nFine: Up to ₹25,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 6 months.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI need assistance with a passport issue for my father. The problem is related to a name correction in his passport application. Here’s the situation:\n\n* My father already has a passport, but it expired 5 years ago.\n* He renewed his passport in 2009, and at that time, due to a misunderstanding, his name was recorded incorrectly. Specifically, his grandfather’s name (father's father's name) was included, resulting in a trimmed/abbreviated version of his actual name.\n* Now, his old passport has a name that doesn’t match his Aadhaar card or other documents.\n\nWe recently applied for a passport renewal and visited the Passport Seva Kendra with all the necessary documents for a name correction. However, the officer in charge put the application on hold and insisted that we update the name on his Aadhaar card to match the old passport.\n\nWhile changing the name on the Aadhaar card is possible, it would create a ripple effect, as many other documents (bank accounts, property papers, etc.) are linked to the current name on his Aadhaar. This is the name we prefer to maintain, as it’s consistent across all other documents.\n\nOur goal is to correct the name in the passport to match the Aadhaar card, rather than changing the Aadhaar card to match the old passport. Is there any way to achieve this? Has anyone faced a similar situation or have advice on how to resolve this issue?\n\nAny guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\n",

However, he didn’t say anything about it at first.**\n\n**When my husband found out I’d been hiding messages, he got extremely angry and started getting violent with me. He says he loves me a lot and is possessive, telling me I shouldn’t talk to anyone else. I tried to fight back, saying I want to continue talking to this person, but then my husband told my family about everything, and things got worse. My mom became physically abusive, and my family started saying awful things to me—things I never imagined they’d say.**\n\n**I feel trapped. My family is now threatening to hurt both me and the person I want to stay in touch with if I leave or continue talking to him. I’m staying with my husband for the sake of my kids, even though I feel completely helpless. The person I wanted to talk to is no longer speaking to me, and my family completely hates both me and him now.**\n\n**I’m terrified to even reach out to him, as my husband is tracking my phone and messages and has been threatening me. I honestly don’t know what to do. All are ignoring me and not letting me leave as well. I feel stuck, scared, and like I have no way out. Does anyone have advice on how to navigate this?**",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI need help understanding what to do in this situation.\n\nThere was a building located on in Kattakada, Thiruvananthapuram, that was severely damaged in a fire in May 2024. It’s in an unsafe condition, with structural instability, burnt debris, and residual oil spills. Despite this, the previous tenant is trying to resume operations there, posing serious risks to public safety.\n\nHere’s what has happened so far:\n\n1. A grievance was filed with the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office, and the issue was forwarded to the District Joint Director (LSGD) and then to the Panchayat.\n\n1. The Panchayat’s investigation report merely stated that “the building is partially ruined” without addressing concerns like structural instability or chemical hazards. No actions have been taken so far.\n\n1. The grievance was closed by the Joint Director's office without verifying if the Panchayat's response addressed the concerns or if any appropriate action was taken.\n\n1. When approached, the Panchayat, the officials said that the Panchayat isn’t responsible for stopping businesses from operating in unsafe premises, but they didn’t clarify which authority is.\n\nI’m not sure what to do next. I’ve contacted multiple authorities, but no action has been taken so far.\n\nMy questions:\n\n* Which authority is responsible for preventing businesses from operating in unsafe buildings in Kerala?\n\n* Should this be escalated to any higher authority?\n\n* Is there any foul play happening? Is that the reason no authority is taking any action?\n\n* How can I ensure that this matter is taken seriously and that action is initiated?\n\nI will attach photos of the burnt building for reference. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!\n\n ",

Apparently, the person who rented my car used it to smuggle a huge quantity of alcohol. Since the smuggler wasn’t caught during the incident, they charged me—the car owner—as an accused.\n\nThe lawyer told me I need to:\n\nGo to Bihar to get bail for my name.\nFile cases in the civil court, DM court, and then the high court to get my car back.\n\nThey also said Zoomcar cannot help me further.\nI hired a lawyer to handle this, but after 9 months, there has been no progress. This situation has taken a massive toll on my mental health. My family, work, and studies are all suffering, and I’m experiencing severe anxiety and depression because of this ordeal.\n\nI feel completely helpless and stuck. Has anyone faced a similar issue or can guide me on what to do next? Are there any legal steps I can take against Zoomcar for their negligence or lack of support?\n\nAny advice or suggestions would mean the world to me. Thank you in advance!\n",

A few months later, during the demonetization period, my father repaid my aunt ₹10 lakh, which she deposited back into her account at that time.\n\nFast forward a few years, and after missing some notices sent to my aunt, the Income Tax Department has now imposed a fine of nearly ₹13 lakh on the transaction. Under the DTVSV Scheme, they’re asking us to settle the case by paying around ₹9 lakh (which includes unofficial \"bribes\").\n\nWe’re stuck deciding between two options:\na) Pay the amount and move on with a peaceful life.\nb) Hire a good lawyer or CA, which could cost around ₹3 lakh (with no guarantee of winning), and fight the case to prove the legitimacy of the transaction.\n\nI’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts or advice. What would be the wisest course of action in this situation?\n\nEDIT: \n*The withdrawal and deposit is all within a span of 6 months.\n\n*The source of fund are from her pension funds which can be shown in the statements.",

I’ve marked the old wire line with ----. Now, our neighbor also wants to shift the poles to the end of their land along the highway. The last two poles are on our land, forming a straight line perpendicular to the road.\n\nThey are saying it won’t be possible without our cooperation (but I know that even if we don’t shift our pole, which is already on our land away from the highway, the second pole near the highway is in the right place). We can't refuse outright because we live in a village and are expected to cooperate.\n\nThe issue is the total cost. The electricity department has quoted around **₹3.5 lakhs** for the shift. They say we will get an official receipt from the government. Since the poles are on the land of three families (including ours), our share of the cost would be around **₹1.2 lakhs**.\n\nI want to understand the process for this:\n\n1. Can they charge this much?\n2. Is it true that the electricity department installs new poles when shifting old ones?\n\n**Other info:**\n\n* **State**: Uk\n* Why shift - We currently have no problem with the poles being on our land since the area is used for farming. However, some neighbors have built buildings nearby, so they are the ones who want this shift.\n* The poles don’t supply electricity to the village (not sure), but I think they are primarily for factories using high-voltage lines.",

        "selftext": "We are a Muslim family from Maharashtra, and I am sharing my sister’s painful story. She was married in 2020 through an arranged marriage. The groom’s family seemed educated but turned out to be extremely controlling and orthodox. From the very first day, my sister faced mental and physical abuse.\n\nHere’s what she went through:\n\n1. **No Freedom from Day One:** On the first day after her wedding, her in-laws took away her phone and sent it back to us. When she asked her husband, he told her that daughters-in-law in their house are not allowed to have phones and she should use his phone instead. To avoid arguments, my sister gave up her phone and her connection to the outside world.\n2. **Total Control Over Her Life:** Her in-laws controlled everything—what she wore, who she talked to, what she ate, even how and when she laughed.\n3. **No Respect in Her Marriage:** Her husband ignored her completely. He spent most of his time with a girl named \"Gudiya,\" who lived with the family but wasn’t related to them. Shockingly, they even shared my sister’s bed while she was forced to sleep on the floor. He avoided talking to her and came home late at night to avoid any confrontation.\n4. **Her Career Dreams Crushed:** My sister is highly qualified (MA in Geography and B.Ed) and wanted to become a professor. Her husband was also a teacher before their marriage, so we thought he would support her dreams. But after marriage, she found out he had quit his job because his mother told him to. When she tried to prepare for exams like NET/SET, her sister-in-law created drama and stopped her from studying.\n5. **No Healthcare or Basic Dignity:** If she fell sick, she was mocked for being weak. They refused to take her to the doctor unless her condition was serious.\n6. **Gold and Dowry Demands:** Her in-laws constantly praised their elder daughter-in-law for bringing dowry and gold every month. They took all the gold my sister brought with her and kept it in a bank without her consent.\n\nShe silently endured this abuse for two years before finally telling us everything. We immediately filed a domestic violence case against her in-laws and husband.\n\n**Legal Struggles**\n\nSince filing the case, her in-laws have avoided every court hearing by manipulating the police and the system. Over a year has passed, and they haven’t attended a single hearing. Meanwhile, my sister has to go to every hearing, reliving her trauma.\n\nEven when a non-bailable warrant was issued, they managed to escape. Their lawyer even got permission for them to skip court appearances. The judge handling the case seems hesitant to take any action, leaving my sister stuck.\n\nTo make things worse, during this time, her husband secretly married another woman without my sister’s consent. While he lives happily, my sister is left to deal with endless legal battles and mental pain.\n\nWe once thought of settling the matter out of court to get her a divorce, but her in-laws refused. They want to “set an example” for other daughters-in-law, showing what happens if they speak out.\n\n**We are desperate for help.** All we want is for my sister to get a divorce and move on with her life.\n\n**Questions We Need Help With:**\n\n1. How can we speed up the court process and make sure her in-laws and husband are held responsible?\n2. What legal steps can we take to secure a divorce and protect her future?\n3. How do we fight the manipulation of the police and courts by her in-laws?\n4. Can stricter action be taken against her husband for marrying another woman without her consent?\n\nPlease help us. My sister deserves a chance to live her life with dignity and hope.",

However, I still treated her like a queen. I completely lived for her and my daughter.\n\nLately, her abusive episodes have started lasting longer and longer. It's broken me. I can't imagine this ending in any way other than divorce. Whether it's next week or 5 years from now, it will happen.\n\nQuestion: How do I keep myself prepared. I know I can contact a divorce lawyer, but what about other things like removing her as the beneficiary from my investments, how do I handle my daughter's schooling, what about all the documents where she is mentioned as my wife. Would a divorce lawyer help me with these?\n\nIn case it matters, we are Muslims. No official marriage certificate but there's a nikahnama and her name is on my passport.",

One of the second generation hier is educated while the rest are not(let’s call him and his kin A and the rest XYZ). This has caused a lot of issues over the years which I will summarise in points. Please feel free to give any info about individual points as well. \n\n1) So A is the only one in possession of the original will and all other survey papers (at least claims to be) and with his he is always encroaching everyone’s property by stating that XYZ have built houses outside the boundaries. \n\nI figure I can get the survey results through a legal process, but the will and other documents, is there a legal process to request him to share all documents that he claims to be the sources with others?\n\n2) A and XYZ agreed to give the said property to a builder for development purposes in 2001. There was some advance money paid out by the builder and there was no development started by the developer in a long time. Since XYZ had no employment, they took out several more advances throughout the years from the said builder, now 20 years later, there is still no development and even though we’re willing to pay the money back (even with interest) the developer isn’t make any progress. \n\nWhat can we do in this situation? \n\nThis has been going on since I was a kid and now I earn quite well and I want to help my dad using some money I can spend. It’s been really hard to see him struggle with his relatives. Any input or suggestions of legal teams are welcome! Thank you for taking the time to read!  ",

        "selftext": "Hi,   \n  \nI want to know certain things. I have been living in rent in a property managed by The Helloworld Coliving in Mumbai. I am facing a fundamental necessity issue, which is drinking water, for which they were supposed to put up a water purifier on the property. They provide water that the property's caretaker refills from another property, and a 20ltr can be used for five people. I have faced multiple issues, such as   \n1. Refilling the water from my friend's place.   \n2. No water available in the middle of the night  \n3. The caretaker not being available to get water, which I have to purchase from Blinkit  \n  \nI had raised multiple complaints with their support team, but they closed the ticket without providing an update or getting a customer response. Their customer service number is provided on the website. I called multiple times, but no one answered the calls. Sometimes, someone responded, but they lack basic essentialnication and accountability. \n\nThe biggest culprit is the property manager; I am sure he has never visited the property. He does most of his work via phone like a mafia boss. Most of the time, he has made false promises and no accountability. Whenever an issue is raised in a call, he gives vague timelines like \"it will be done\". And the biggest irony is that there is only one property manager for the entire location. The support team mainly contacts the property manager to resolve tickets. IItis like a Ponzi scheme where the issue goes completely unheard. I am paying 30k as rent for one single room; I mean, there is a TV, a F#\\*\\*ING TV in the amenities, which is entirely useless but no Water Purifier. The management should be pretty dumb and lame to come up with this.\n\n  \nNow the reason I am facing eviction is I have already mentioned to the support team on email that I will be withholding my rent payment until my issue is fixed which they don't seem to care about as they closed those support tickets which I have raised saying the issue has been fixed but in ground reality nothing's been done. I am clear that when I signed the agreement Water Purifer was part of the amenities that they were supposed to provide. What should I do in this case?",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI need some legal advice regarding a complicated situation.\n\nBackground: I come from a lower-income family. My mother left me immediately when I was born due to psychiatric issues and has lived with her parents for over 25 years. Dad tried applying for divorce, but with no address, no answer or response, he didn't get the divorce. I grew up with my father’s parents, who passed away in 2018.\n\nAfter 15+ years of waiting, My dad (58) found a live-in partner in 2010 who agreed to live without divorce or marriage initially.. She (40) a divorcee with two kids from her first marriage. She didn't tell anything and all lies about her first husband being drunkard and so on. \nThings went downhill quickly with her living in my home— within 1 month my grandparents started losing things, theft, bad behavior, and targeting on property. Whenever dad is at home she acts like an angel with me and grandparents.\n\nGrandparents kicked her out within 1 month and my dad and she have lived separately since 2012 in a rented home.\n\nI am disabled and 90% deaf, and I live in the house my grandparents built in Bangalore. My dad visits daily to help me out with household chores.\n\nIn 2015, dad discovered she had an affair in her first marriage that led to her divorce. Even with dad she had affairs late night talks and dad once caught a guy in home when she was alone. She just brushed it off saying friends. \n\nIn 2017, she had lung cancer, which she made my dad financially supported for operation and recovery.\n\nIn 2018, she had medical treatment to conceive again and ended up having a child without my dad’s decision as well. We don't even know if the kid belongs to dad. She hid this news until the 6th month.\n\nIn 2021, they had a violent fight, leading to police involvement. She took the child and ran to Kerala. She’s using the child to emotionally blackmail dad and has sent legal notices to my address claiming dowry and demanding to live in my home. Despite her issues, people seem to side with her. She tried to barge into my home and dad tried to push her out, leading to my name being included in an FIR.\n\nNow, in 2025, a similar fight happened in their rental home and police were called again.\n\nShe’s sending more legal notices through lawyers in Kerala and demands my dad appear before the Kerala Vanitha Committee on a date. \nThis notice came through my home address and dad unknowingly signed and took the letter, later he was regretting he should not have taken in my home address. \n\nThe latest issue is that she wants to live in my home, as my dad has no income.\nAnd she wants dad to marry her in order to see the child or to be in peace, else she would work on creating issues. \n\nMy dad has a small 1BHK near Electronic City around agricultural land, but she refuses to live there and insists on coming to my home.\n\nShe is also trying to involve me in all this and I suspect she'll again try to enter my home forcefully to live in.\n\nI’m already struggling with my disability unable to work effectively, lost my future, and finances aspects, and now the added legal fees and headache are difficult to pay. \n\nMy home is still in my grandparents' name, and I need to settle a amount as per will with my dad's sister to own it in my name which i am yet to do. \n\nWhat can I legally do to stop her from sending these notices and pulling me into this mess?\nCan i send a return notice to not disturb me and my dad does not stay here in my home? \n\nI don’t want her to stay in my home. Should I send a response to the lawyer stating my dad doesn’t live with me full-time? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nI’m also worried for my dad, who is 58 and having knee issues and worsening health not sure what kind of trouble will he be in. \nHow can i help my dad here. I know he did msny mistakes. But he supports me and understand my issues and try to help me as much as possible. \n\nI have no one to approach or ask for help, no relatives would come in for help unless there is a death. ",

Around the same time, my sister's old friend who had a new Instagram account also messaged her. We didn't know it was a friend. We thought it was one of the miscreants. Some rude messages were exchanged and then that person (friend) stopped. \n1. We filed an FIR against all the 4 anonymous Insta accounts. \n1. The police got their real names from Meta company. \n1. We also managed to get the names of the account owners from the cops. 2 people who had a quarrel with my sister and 1 old friend (that's how we came to know about the friend's new account). \n1.

Background:\n\nI applied for a teaching post where the notification mentioned that only candidates with a B.Ed. in Special Education are eligible.\n\nHowever, I knew the qualifications mentioned in the notification were incomplete because, based on past vacancies, candidates with a graduation + special diploma (recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India, RCI) were also eligible.\n\nThe RCI is the only body authorized to decide eligibility criteria for such posts, not the government.\n\n\n\n2. My Qualifications at the Time:\n\nI had a special diploma and was pursuing my graduation.

Current Scenario:\n\nI did not attend document verification because I had not completed my graduation by the last date of application, as per the notification’s criteria. , also government was only allowing special bed candidates\n\nMeanwhile, the government sought clarification from the RCI regarding qualifications, and the RCI confirmed that diploma holders (like me) are also valid for the post.\n\nAnd after 6-8 months due to some answers get changed, 2x result was canceled, and a new, fresh result was released today.

Unfortunately, all the items had some issue or the other in terms of size and fit so I decided to return it. I raised a request to return the items on 30th Dec and my order was picked up by a Delhivery guy on 31st Dec 2024. The person who picked it up was behaving very strangely. As he went through each item to confirm everything was there with all tags intact, he kept asking me the total value of the order and saying \"Ye order toh kaafi mehenga hoga na madam?\" \nI didn't respond and asked him to verify if it was him who was supposed to pick it up. And he said yes and that it was his first day of work so he is new to all this. I verified his phone number from the Delhivery app and then handed him my entire parcel. I later got an email from Delhivery that day that my order was picked up. \n\nOn 3rd Jan 2025, I received and email from Delhivery that my parcel was returned to Zara warehouse. Usually, when we return items to Zara, we get an email from them confirming that they have received it and the refund will be processed. I kept waiting for that email but didn't get one. I contacted Zara's customer service on 10th Jan 2025 and they told me they had only received one sweater in the parcel and it was a non-Zara item so they will not be giving me a refund. I have been chasing them ever since through calls every other day and their executives keep telling me to wait for 24-48 hours as my case has been expedited. But it's going to be month since I returned all the items. \n\nI have my suspicions that the Delhivery pickup guy stole my parcel and handed them random item. But I have not even been able to reach out to Delhivery since they deactivate their AWBs within 15 days. And their automated customer service says to contact the seller. And Zara has been utterly useless in those terms. \n\nI really need my money back. \n\nIs this worth filing a case in consumer court? How can we do it? Or is there any other way I can get them to give my refund. ",

        "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nThanks in advance for reading this huge wall of text :)\n\nA family member of mine booked a wedding hall/banquet situated in Sec 56 Gurgaon on July 7th 2024. They paid 90000 as a booking amount of the total Rs 3,15,000 (Food and Venue only, no decoration.). \n\nThey had booked the pool side venue, however at the time of booking, the pool was operational for members and functions were not being conducted. The Salesperson told us that we can come in November to look at their poolside functions to finalize our decoration.\n\nFast forward to end of November, we had not heard anything from the sales person, and after following up with her multiple times to give us a time to visit the venue for tasting and to see the decoration, she finally gave us a date of Dec 4th. She had informed us that there would be a wedding function in the eve of 4th Dec where we can see sample decoration and taste the food. \n\nWhen on Dec 4th we reached the venue, it was in an ABYSSMAL condition. It looked like they were taking apart the decoration instead of putting it up. Keep in mind that we went there at 8 pm, and the wedding guests had almost started to arrive. \n\nThe entire venue was covered in used straws and disposable spoons/plates, maybe from the day before function and nobody had bothered cleaning it up. The sofa for the bride and groom was dirty and torn and had food/stains marks all over. The low chairs for the bride and groom during pheras, were dirty, and had holes in them. Without getting into more details, it was a very horrible setup.\n\nNow based on all of this, we decided to confront the sales lady (who had been trying to avoid us the entire time btw), and we told them to cancel the venue. \n\nWe had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. With to and fro with the venue management, we were able to get them to send an email to us stating that they will refund \"the amount that we paid at the time of booking\" and that we can expect the refund in 3rd week of January 2025. \n\nHowever, since passing of 3rd week of Jan 2025, they have stopped responding and keep saying that they will send a final date soon. \n\nTldr: A family member booked a poolside wedding venue in Sec 56, Gurgaon, for July 7, 2024, paying ₹90,000 upfront (total ₹3,15,000). The salesperson promised a visit in November to view decorations and food tasting, but after delays, they finally scheduled it for Dec 4. Upon visiting, the venue was in terrible condition—dirty, torn furniture, and no proper setup despite an ongoing event. The family decided to cancel, however they had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. Upon negotiations, the family got an email confirmation of a refund with the venue management. The venue promised a refund by mid-Jan 2025 but has since stopped responding and delayed giving a final refund date. \n\nWhat legal steps can the family take to recover this amount? \n\n",

It’s going to be little long but he actually needs help so please read\n\nHe met a girl in 2019 they fell in love and started living together later he got to know that she was married but she said they got divorced and he trusted her! Then 6 months into the relationship she was after him to get married within 5-10 days as her mother was sick and there won’t be any auspicious day after 30th of some month i don’t remember. He tried to explain her that marriage doesn’t happen quickly and he doesn’t earn enough to be married and he also want big wedding someday! But she kept forcing him by saying I don’t care about big wedding i want small wedding!\nIt was just after lockdown and they got married in Arya samaj.\n\nAfter 1 year of marriage she started behaving controlling like leave your friends stay home with me all the time! Mind that she was 5-6 years older to him, he didn’t want to leave his friends and wanted to drink occasionally  with his friends but whenever he made plans she threatened him by saying i will jump from the building or i will cut my hand!\n\nBefore this threatening happened, my friend bought a house on his name and made his wife the nominee! But later on he could not take all this and he ran off!\n\nIt’s been 3 years since he has left his own home! She took all the stuff from the house which had some very expensive stuff also! She took property papers too which is in her bank locker! \n\nWhen she didn’t respond to mutual divorce! My friend met a girl and have been living with her and wants to marry her so he decided to talk to an advocate! Now he got to know she was married before but never divorced her first husband! Lawyer told him if my friend wants to marry again he can but he needs to forget about his own house any all the stuff including money in joint account with her!\n\nNow finally his wife filled a complaint saying he tortured her basically 498 or something! And she also included his mother and sister in it when he has been living away from family for past 11 years and she met the family twice only that too for lunch or dinner only!\n\nSo he wants to know that she can take away his home and joint account money? Which is his only asset as his family doesn’t talk to him and have nothing else. And as she is not divorced before so can she still claim everything ?",

There's plenty of proof here - [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/wx2opz/the_headband_on_my_q30_headphones_broke_after_a/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/lhcei6/soundcore_q30_design_flaw_the_plastic_clips_next/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/xlvwjj/another_broken_soundcore_q30/) [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/187blhc/soundcore_q30_part_broke/) [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/nv4jhk/my_soundcore_q30_broke_always_felt_right_side_was/)\n\nI contacted Anker regarding the 18 Month Warranty claim since a good few people got a new pair after the brittle plastic headband broke the same way, or at least that's what they claimed on their respective reddit threads. I contacted them via email regarding the same and I was shocked by their reply. They said and I quote - \n\n\"I'm sorry to hear about the damage to your product. Unfortunately, according to our policy, we do not provide a warranty if the product is damaged or lost due to improper use. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.\"\n\nIt's not even due to outside damage or misuse which they mention in their warranty terms, it's literally the cheap quality of plastic used in the headband. Also if it's not covered under the warranty claim, then why replace them for customers outside of India? This is a well known defect and they've very much acknowledged it in the past as well, I am positively mystified at this remark.\n\nIs there something I can do legally to get them to honor this warranty claim? Seems like they've shut down my ticket too.",

Grandma is still alive and apparently grandpa didn’t leave anything for her or us according to uncle. He just showed us the first page of the document and has stopped responding to the entire family and is refusing to show the entire gift deed/ will. \n\nFor context, my dad supported my grandpa financially when he was alive and looked after his medical expenses/ insurance. But their relationship grew distant in the past few years, chiefly due to grandpa’s orthodox mindset.\n\nLawyer is telling us to find out exact date of registration of gift deed but we have no idea as the witness was paid off by uncle. Any suggestions how to proceed? Gift deed was signed in a tier 3 city and my family is in a separate megacity so travel will have to be planned properly. ",

        "selftext": "Context:\n\nMy mother is a Physical Education teacher at a government school in Bengaluru.\n\nAfter the Republic Day celebrations, she visited her school in the evening to take down and fold the national flag.\n\n\nWhat Happened:\n\n1. She discovered that massive, decades-old trees on the school campus had been cut down.\n\n\n2. The school headmaster had permission to cut only one dead/dried-out tree and this was done by the concerned authorities by following the procedure few days back\n\n\n3. But yesterday (26/1/25) me and my mom saw that the headmaster has illegally cut two healthy trees without proper authorization (she wasn't present at the sight) and we have a video evidence of the man admitting that the headmaster has payed him to cut.\n\n\n4. The wood from these trees is very valuable and is intended for personal profit.\n\n\n5. As per procedure, tree-felling requires permission from BBMP or the Karnataka Forest Department, who also handle the cutting and removal process. This wasn’t followed.\n\n\n6. My mother recorded videos of the site as evidence and is considering filing a complaint.\n\n\n\nMy Concerns:\n\nIf my mother or I escalate this (e.g., filing a complaint or posting on Twitter), could we face any legal trouble or retaliation from the school/headmaster?\n\nIs there any other legal procedure or body we should approach to address this?\n\n\nKey Questions for Advice:\n\n1. What are the potential legal risks for us if we take this forward?\n\n\n2. What steps should we take to ensure this is handled legally and safely?\n\n\n3. Is there any way to ensure anonymity for my mother while filing the complaint? I'm planning to post this on X(twitter) since benguluru police are active there from what I know ",

The son is survived by a wife; will the property now be jointly owned by both the mother and the daughter-in-law?\n\n\t2.\tWhen the property was registered, both the son and the mother were listed as joint owners. However, it was mentioned that the registry included a discount due to the woman’s ownership. Does this imply that the registry is in the mother’s name, and that the property will be transferred solely to her?\n\n\t3.\tIf the property is transferred to the mother’s name, does the daughter-in-law have any rights to it?\n\n\t4.\tIf the mother ultimately receives the property, can she transfer it as a gift to her daughter in order to prevent the daughter-in-law from acquiring any rights to it?\n\nLooking forward to any insights!",

        "selftext": "I had booked a bus ticket for two through redBus for a journey from Ahmedabad to Pune on January 27th for a whopping inflated price of ₹7000 (due to coldplay concert). The original departure time was 8:05 PM. However, on the same day of travel, at 10:17 AM, I received an email from the bus operator stating that the bus had been rescheduled and preponed to 6:05 PM.\n\nThere was no way I could have made it 2 hours earlier than what I had initially planned because I was travelling from Porbandar. When I contacted the bus operator, they could only offer an alternate bus for the next day, which was not a feasible option for me. \n\nI reached out to redBus support for help. The redBus team suggested that I book another ticket on my own while they escalated the issue for a refund, asking me to wait 48 hours for a resolution. However, within just 1 hour of filing the complaint, they marked it as ‘Resolved’ and denied the refund. They claimed that the bus operator provided a “reasonable” solution to me. They didn’t even mention what was the “reasonable” solution provided.\n\nSince then, I’ve been going back and forth with redBus support but haven’t received any resolution.\n\nAny advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.",

So the latest agreement is over a month old.\n\nHowever, the landlord in question has not been paying the society maintenance charges for a year now. In addition, a couple of days ago, I also received a Property Tax Demand (Rs. 16K or so) from the BMC meaning he hasn't been paying that either. I have been forwarding these to him over WhatsApp.\n\nThe society office is on my side, and are asking me not to pay the rent for the next month (I planned to pay it as per schedule on Feb 5). They say this will put adequate pressure on him to turn up and clear their bill. Should I proceed with not paying?\n\nAlso, I don't want to deal with this headache anyway - can I just take the hit on my security deposit and walk away, no questions asked? The security deposit is worth approx 3 months of rent. The agreement has a clause saying there is a lock-in period of 6 months, but it also states in another part that the landlord is responsible for paying all the bills. \n\nWhat should I do?",

        "selftext": "This post is based on my understanding of the **Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill, 2024**. If there are any mistakes or inaccuracies, please let me know in the comments! I'm happy to learn and discuss. 😊\n\n# Uttarakhand Implements Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in 2024\n\nThe Uttarakhand government has introduced the **Uniform Civil Code (UCC)**, making it the first Indian state to adopt a unified legal framework for all its residents. This law simplifies and regulates matters like **marriage, divorce, inheritance**, and **live-in relationships**, ensuring everyone is treated equally under the same set of laws, regardless of their religion or cultural practices.\n\n# Key Points of the UCC\n\n1. **Marriage Rules:**\n   * Both partners must be **unmarried** at the time of marriage.\n   * Minimum age for marriage: **21 years for men, 18 years for women.**\n   * Marriage between close relatives (prohibited relationships) is not allowed unless permitted by specific customs, and those customs must not go against public policy.\n2. **Polygamy Banned:**\n   * Polygamy is **prohibited for everyone**, including communities where it was previously allowed (e.g., Muslim personal laws).\n   * Only **monogamous marriages** will be legally valid under the UCC.\n3. **Mandatory Marriage Registration:**\n   * Every marriage, even if solemnized outside Uttarakhand, must be registered with the authorities if at least one partner is a resident of the state.\n   * Marriages conducted since **2010** must also be registered retroactively.\n4. **Live-in Relationships:**\n   * Couples in live-in relationships must register their partnership within **30 days** of living together.\n   * **Children born from live-in relationships are considered legitimate** and will have inheritance rights.\n   * Women deserted by live-in partners can claim **financial support (maintenance)** through the courts.\n5. **Equal Inheritance Rights:**\n   * Both sons and daughters are given **equal inheritance rights** to their parents’ property, ensuring gender equality.\n6. **Religious Freedom for Ceremonies:**\n   * Couples can marry following their own religious or customary traditions, such as **Saptapadi, Nikah, Holy Union**, or **Anand Karaj.**\n\n# Who Does It Apply To?\n\n* The UCC applies to **all residents of Uttarakhand**, even those living outside the state.\n* **Scheduled Tribes** and groups with **protected customary practices** under the Constitution are exempt from this Code.\n\n# What Changes Under the UCC?\n\nThe UCC replaces personal laws based on religion with a **common set of rules** for everyone. For example:\n\n* Practices like **polygamy** are no longer allowed.\n* There is now a standardized procedure for marriage, divorce, and property inheritance.\n* Women in both marriages and live-in relationships have clear legal protections.\n\nFINE AND IMPRISONMENT \n\n* Under the Uttarakhand UCC, 2024, failing to submit a live-in relationship statement can result in:\n\nFine: Up to ₹10,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 3 months.\n\nProviding false information or ignoring notices can lead to stricter penalties, including:\n\nFine: Up to ₹25,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 6 months.",

Here’s the situation:\n\n* My father already has a passport, but it expired 5 years ago.\n* He renewed his passport in 2009, and at that time, due to a misunderstanding, his name was recorded incorrectly. Specifically, his grandfather’s name (father's father's name) was included, resulting in a trimmed/abbreviated version of his actual name.\n* Now, his old passport has a name that doesn’t match his Aadhaar card or other documents.\n\nWe recently applied for a passport renewal and visited the Passport Seva Kendra with all the necessary documents for a name correction. However, the officer in charge put the application on hold and insisted that we update the name on his Aadhaar card to match the old passport.\n\nWhile changing the name on the Aadhaar card is possible, it would create a ripple effect, as many other documents (bank accounts, property papers, etc.) are linked to the current name on his Aadhaar. This is the name we prefer to maintain, as it’s consistent across all other documents.\n\nOur goal is to correct the name in the passport to match the Aadhaar card, rather than changing the Aadhaar card to match the old passport. Is there any way to achieve this? Has anyone faced a similar situation or have advice on how to resolve this issue?\n\nAny guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

He says he loves me a lot and is possessive, telling me I shouldn’t talk to anyone else. I tried to fight back, saying I want to continue talking to this person, but then my husband told my family about everything, and things got worse. My mom became physically abusive, and my family started saying awful things to me—things I never imagined they’d say.**\n\n**I feel trapped. My family is now threatening to hurt both me and the person I want to stay in touch with if I leave or continue talking to him.

It’s in an unsafe condition, with structural instability, burnt debris, and residual oil spills. Despite this, the previous tenant is trying to resume operations there, posing serious risks to public safety.\n\nHere’s what has happened so far:\n\n1. A grievance was filed with the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office, and the issue was forwarded to the District Joint Director (LSGD) and then to the Panchayat.\n\n1. The Panchayat’s investigation report merely stated that “the building is partially ruined” without addressing concerns like structural instability or chemical hazards. No actions have been taken so far.\n\n1. The grievance was closed by the Joint Director's office without verifying if the Panchayat's response addressed the concerns or if any appropriate action was taken.\n\n1. When approached, the Panchayat, the officials said that the Panchayat isn’t responsible for stopping businesses from operating in unsafe premises, but they didn’t clarify which authority is.\n\nI’m not sure what to do next. I’ve contacted multiple authorities, but no action has been taken so far.\n\nMy questions:\n\n* Which authority is responsible for preventing businesses from operating in unsafe buildings in Kerala?\n\n* Should this be escalated to any higher authority?\n\n* Is there any foul play happening? Is that the reason no authority is taking any action?\n\n* How can I ensure that this matter is taken seriously and that action is initiated?\n\nI will attach photos of the burnt building for reference. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!\n\n ",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m in a very distressing situation and could really use some advice. Last year, I rented my car on Zoomcar from May 30th to June 2nd. Since then, I have not gotten my car back. It’s been almost 9 months, and dealing with Zoomcar has been a nightmare.\n\nAfter repeated attempts to get in touch, their lawyer finally called me and informed me that my car has been impounded by the Bihar police. Apparently, the person who rented my car used it to smuggle a huge quantity of alcohol. Since the smuggler wasn’t caught during the incident, they charged me—the car owner—as an accused.\n\nThe lawyer told me I need to:\n\nGo to Bihar to get bail for my name.\nFile cases in the civil court, DM court, and then the high court to get my car back.\n\nThey also said Zoomcar cannot help me further.\nI hired a lawyer to handle this, but after 9 months, there has been no progress. This situation has taken a massive toll on my mental health. My family, work, and studies are all suffering, and I’m experiencing severe anxiety and depression because of this ordeal.\n\nI feel completely helpless and stuck. Has anyone faced a similar issue or can guide me on what to do next? Are there any legal steps I can take against Zoomcar for their negligence or lack of support?\n\nAny advice or suggestions would mean the world to me. Thank you in advance!\n",

I’ve marked the old wire line with ----. Now, our neighbor also wants to shift the poles to the end of their land along the highway. The last two poles are on our land, forming a straight line perpendicular to the road.\n\nThey are saying it won’t be possible without our cooperation (but I know that even if we don’t shift our pole, which is already on our land away from the highway, the second pole near the highway is in the right place). We can't refuse outright because we live in a village and are expected to cooperate.\n\nThe issue is the total cost. The electricity department has quoted around **₹3.5 lakhs** for the shift. They say we will get an official receipt from the government. Since the poles are on the land of three families (including ours), our share of the cost would be around **₹1.2 lakhs**.\n\nI want to understand the process for this:\n\n1. Can they charge this much?\n2. Is it true that the electricity department installs new poles when shifting old ones?\n\n**Other info:**\n\n* **State**: Uk\n* Why shift - We currently have no problem with the poles being on our land since the area is used for farming. However, some neighbors have built buildings nearby, so they are the ones who want this shift.\n* The poles don’t supply electricity to the village (not sure), but I think they are primarily for factories using high-voltage lines.",

The groom’s family seemed educated but turned out to be extremely controlling and orthodox.

He spent most of his time with a girl named \"Gudiya,\" who lived with the family but wasn’t related to them. Shockingly, they even shared my sister’s bed while she was forced to sleep on the floor. He avoided talking to her and came home late at night to avoid any confrontation.\n4. **Her Career Dreams Crushed:** My sister is highly qualified (MA in Geography and B.Ed) and wanted to become a professor. Her husband was also a teacher before their marriage, so we thought he would support her dreams. But after marriage, she found out he had quit his job because his mother told him to. When she tried to prepare for exams like NET/SET, her sister-in-law created drama and stopped her from studying.\n5. **No Healthcare or Basic Dignity:** If she fell sick, she was mocked for being weak. They refused to take her to the doctor unless her condition was serious.\n6. **Gold and Dowry Demands:** Her in-laws constantly praised their elder daughter-in-law for bringing dowry and gold every month. They took all the gold my sister brought with her and kept it in a bank without her consent.\n\nShe silently endured this abuse for two years before finally telling us everything. We immediately filed a domestic violence case against her in-laws and husband.\n\n**Legal Struggles**\n\nSince filing the case, her in-laws have avoided every court hearing by manipulating the police and the system. Over a year has passed, and they haven’t attended a single hearing. Meanwhile, my sister has to go to every hearing, reliving her trauma.\n\nEven when a non-bailable warrant was issued, they managed to escape. Their lawyer even got permission for them to skip court appearances. The judge handling the case seems hesitant to take any action, leaving my sister stuck.\n\nTo make things worse, during this time, her husband secretly married another woman without my sister’s consent. While he lives happily, my sister is left to deal with endless legal battles and mental pain.\n\nWe once thought of settling the matter out of court to get her a divorce, but her in-laws refused. They want to “set an example” for other daughters-in-law, showing what happens if they speak out.\n\n**We are desperate for help.** All we want is for my sister to get a divorce and move on with her life.\n\n**Questions We Need Help With:**\n\n1. How can we speed up the court process and make sure her in-laws and husband are held responsible?\n2. What legal steps can we take to secure a divorce and protect her future?\n3. How do we fight the manipulation of the police and courts by her in-laws?\n4. Can stricter action be taken against her husband for marrying another woman without her consent?\n\nPlease help us. My sister deserves a chance to live her life with dignity and hope.",

I met the ARO, and he said he would do the work after coming for inspection and the remaining 3 offices.

I confirmed with him today if he submitted and paid the fees in total. He said yes.\n\nBecause of this delay, we are unable to sell the office. In such a situation, does the buyer have a right to cancel the purchase although the property has been registered? Also, two companies refused to rent the office because we didn't have a khata.",

Please feel free to give any info about individual points as well. \n\n1) So A is the only one in possession of the original will and all other survey papers (at least claims to be) and with his he is always encroaching everyone’s property by stating that XYZ have built houses outside the boundaries. \n\nI figure I can get the survey results through a legal process, but the will and other documents, is there a legal process to request him to share all documents that he claims to be the sources with others?\n\n2) A and XYZ agreed to give the said property to a builder for development purposes in 2001. There was some advance money paid out by the builder and there was no development started by the developer in a long time. Since XYZ had no employment, they took out several more advances throughout the years from the said builder, now 20 years later, there is still no development and even though we’re willing to pay the money back (even with interest) the developer isn’t make any progress. \n\nWhat can we do in this situation? \n\nThis has been going on since I was a kid and now I earn quite well and I want to help my dad using some money I can spend. It’s been really hard to see him struggle with his relatives. Any input or suggestions of legal teams are welcome! Thank you for taking the time to read!  ",

        "selftext": "Hi,   \n  \nI want to know certain things. I have been living in rent in a property managed by The Helloworld Coliving in Mumbai. I am facing a fundamental necessity issue, which is drinking water, for which they were supposed to put up a water purifier on the property. They provide water that the property's caretaker refills from another property, and a 20ltr can be used for five people. I have faced multiple issues, such as   \n1. Refilling the water from my friend's place.   \n2. No water available in the middle of the night  \n3. The caretaker not being available to get water, which I have to purchase from Blinkit  \n  \nI had raised multiple complaints with their support team, but they closed the ticket without providing an update or getting a customer response. Their customer service number is provided on the website. I called multiple times, but no one answered the calls. Sometimes, someone responded, but they lack basic essentialnication and accountability. \n\nThe biggest culprit is the property manager; I am sure he has never visited the property. He does most of his work via phone like a mafia boss. Most of the time, he has made false promises and no accountability. Whenever an issue is raised in a call, he gives vague timelines like \"it will be done\". And the biggest irony is that there is only one property manager for the entire location. The support team mainly contacts the property manager to resolve tickets. IItis like a Ponzi scheme where the issue goes completely unheard. I am paying 30k as rent for one single room; I mean, there is a TV, a F#\\*\\*ING TV in the amenities, which is entirely useless but no Water Purifier. The management should be pretty dumb and lame to come up with this.\n\n  \nNow the reason I am facing eviction is I have already mentioned to the support team on email that I will be withholding my rent payment until my issue is fixed which they don't seem to care about as they closed those support tickets which I have raised saying the issue has been fixed but in ground reality nothing's been done. I am clear that when I signed the agreement Water Purifer was part of the amenities that they were supposed to provide. What should I do in this case?",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI need some legal advice regarding a complicated situation.\n\nBackground: I come from a lower-income family. My mother left me immediately when I was born due to psychiatric issues and has lived with her parents for over 25 years. Dad tried applying for divorce, but with no address, no answer or response, he didn't get the divorce. I grew up with my father’s parents, who passed away in 2018.\n\nAfter 15+ years of waiting, My dad (58) found a live-in partner in 2010 who agreed to live without divorce or marriage initially.. She (40) a divorcee with two kids from her first marriage. She didn't tell anything and all lies about her first husband being drunkard and so on. \nThings went downhill quickly with her living in my home— within 1 month my grandparents started losing things, theft, bad behavior, and targeting on property. Whenever dad is at home she acts like an angel with me and grandparents.\n\nGrandparents kicked her out within 1 month and my dad and she have lived separately since 2012 in a rented home.\n\nI am disabled and 90% deaf, and I live in the house my grandparents built in Bangalore. My dad visits daily to help me out with household chores.\n\nIn 2015, dad discovered she had an affair in her first marriage that led to her divorce. Even with dad she had affairs late night talks and dad once caught a guy in home when she was alone. She just brushed it off saying friends. \n\nIn 2017, she had lung cancer, which she made my dad financially supported for operation and recovery.\n\nIn 2018, she had medical treatment to conceive again and ended up having a child without my dad’s decision as well. We don't even know if the kid belongs to dad. She hid this news until the 6th month.\n\nIn 2021, they had a violent fight, leading to police involvement. She took the child and ran to Kerala. She’s using the child to emotionally blackmail dad and has sent legal notices to my address claiming dowry and demanding to live in my home. Despite her issues, people seem to side with her. She tried to barge into my home and dad tried to push her out, leading to my name being included in an FIR.\n\nNow, in 2025, a similar fight happened in their rental home and police were called again.\n\nShe’s sending more legal notices through lawyers in Kerala and demands my dad appear before the Kerala Vanitha Committee on a date. \nThis notice came through my home address and dad unknowingly signed and took the letter, later he was regretting he should not have taken in my home address. \n\nThe latest issue is that she wants to live in my home, as my dad has no income.\nAnd she wants dad to marry her in order to see the child or to be in peace, else she would work on creating issues. \n\nMy dad has a small 1BHK near Electronic City around agricultural land, but she refuses to live there and insists on coming to my home.\n\nShe is also trying to involve me in all this and I suspect she'll again try to enter my home forcefully to live in.\n\nI’m already struggling with my disability unable to work effectively, lost my future, and finances aspects, and now the added legal fees and headache are difficult to pay. \n\nMy home is still in my grandparents' name, and I need to settle a amount as per will with my dad's sister to own it in my name which i am yet to do. \n\nWhat can I legally do to stop her from sending these notices and pulling me into this mess?\nCan i send a return notice to not disturb me and my dad does not stay here in my home? \n\nI don’t want her to stay in my home. Should I send a response to the lawyer stating my dad doesn’t live with me full-time? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nI’m also worried for my dad, who is 58 and having knee issues and worsening health not sure what kind of trouble will he be in. \nHow can i help my dad here. I know he did msny mistakes. But he supports me and understand my issues and try to help me as much as possible. \n\nI have no one to approach or ask for help, no relatives would come in for help unless there is a death. ",

I know that i will get a refund but the it was imperative that i had to travel to the aizawl as my returning flight to bengaluru was on the 26th, and i could not miss this.\n\nNow, other than the ticket refund, how can i remake the loss of 18K, i am at the moment broke and in debt to a friend. Is there a way to force the company to payup, all they said was operational difficulties and i have it on record. from my understanding i think they couldn't get a lot of people on the plane to make it worth the cost of service, but that's not my problem.I think this is a unique case as i spoke to some of the staff and they said not many people had any other flights from flying plans from aizawl",

        "selftext": "\n\nI need advice regarding my eligibility for a teaching post and whether I should pursue a court case to claim the position. Here’s my situation:\n\n1. Background:\n\nI applied for a teaching post where the notification mentioned that only candidates with a B.Ed. in Special Education are eligible.\n\nHowever, I knew the qualifications mentioned in the notification were incomplete because, based on past vacancies, candidates with a graduation + special diploma (recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India, RCI) were also eligible.\n\nThe RCI is the only body authorized to decide eligibility criteria for such posts, not the government.\n\n\n\n2. My Qualifications at the Time:\n\nI had a special diploma and was pursuing my graduation. However, my graduation was incomplete at the time of application.\n\nDespite this, I filled out the form, sat for the exam, and scored more than 20 marks above the cutoff (in the 2x result list).\n\n\n\n3. Current Scenario:\n\nI did not attend document verification because I had not completed my graduation by the last date of application, as per the notification’s criteria. , also government was only allowing special bed candidates\n\nMeanwhile, the government sought clarification from the RCI regarding qualifications, and the RCI confirmed that diploma holders (like me) are also valid for the post.\n\nAnd after 6-8 months due to some answers get changed, 2x result was canceled, and a new, fresh result was released today. My roll number is still in this list.\n\n\n\n4. Dilemma:\n\nThe notification clearly stated that all qualifications must be completed by the last date of application, which I did not meet.\n\nHowever, I believe I am eligible for the post based on RCI's clarification and past precedence.\n\nI desperately need this job, and I worked incredibly hard for it.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\nDo I have a strong case if I file a court petition?\n\nWhat legal arguments can I make to strengthen my case?\n\nAre there any past judgments or legal principles that could support my claim?\n\n\nI understand my chances might be slim, but I want to explore all possible options. Your guidance would mean a lot to me.\n\nThank you!\n\n.\n\n",

Unfortunately, all the items had some issue or the other in terms of size and fit so I decided to return it. I raised a request to return the items on 30th Dec and my order was picked up by a Delhivery guy on 31st Dec 2024. The person who picked it up was behaving very strangely. As he went through each item to confirm everything was there with all tags intact, he kept asking me the total value of the order and saying \"Ye order toh kaafi mehenga hoga na madam?\" \nI didn't respond and asked him to verify if it was him who was supposed to pick it up. And he said yes and that it was his first day of work so he is new to all this. I verified his phone number from the Delhivery app and then handed him my entire parcel. I later got an email from Delhivery that day that my order was picked up. \n\nOn 3rd Jan 2025, I received and email from Delhivery that my parcel was returned to Zara warehouse. Usually, when we return items to Zara, we get an email from them confirming that they have received it and the refund will be processed. I kept waiting for that email but didn't get one. I contacted Zara's customer service on 10th Jan 2025 and they told me they had only received one sweater in the parcel and it was a non-Zara item so they will not be giving me a refund. I have been chasing them ever since through calls every other day and their executives keep telling me to wait for 24-48 hours as my case has been expedited. But it's going to be month since I returned all the items. \n\nI have my suspicions that the Delhivery pickup guy stole my parcel and handed them random item. But I have not even been able to reach out to Delhivery since they deactivate their AWBs within 15 days. And their automated customer service says to contact the seller. And Zara has been utterly useless in those terms. \n\nI really need my money back. \n\nIs this worth filing a case in consumer court? How can we do it? Or is there any other way I can get them to give my refund. ",

        "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nThanks in advance for reading this huge wall of text :)\n\nA family member of mine booked a wedding hall/banquet situated in Sec 56 Gurgaon on July 7th 2024. They paid 90000 as a booking amount of the total Rs 3,15,000 (Food and Venue only, no decoration.). \n\nThey had booked the pool side venue, however at the time of booking, the pool was operational for members and functions were not being conducted. The Salesperson told us that we can come in November to look at their poolside functions to finalize our decoration.\n\nFast forward to end of November, we had not heard anything from the sales person, and after following up with her multiple times to give us a time to visit the venue for tasting and to see the decoration, she finally gave us a date of Dec 4th. She had informed us that there would be a wedding function in the eve of 4th Dec where we can see sample decoration and taste the food. \n\nWhen on Dec 4th we reached the venue, it was in an ABYSSMAL condition. It looked like they were taking apart the decoration instead of putting it up. Keep in mind that we went there at 8 pm, and the wedding guests had almost started to arrive. \n\nThe entire venue was covered in used straws and disposable spoons/plates, maybe from the day before function and nobody had bothered cleaning it up. The sofa for the bride and groom was dirty and torn and had food/stains marks all over. The low chairs for the bride and groom during pheras, were dirty, and had holes in them. Without getting into more details, it was a very horrible setup.\n\nNow based on all of this, we decided to confront the sales lady (who had been trying to avoid us the entire time btw), and we told them to cancel the venue. \n\nWe had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. With to and fro with the venue management, we were able to get them to send an email to us stating that they will refund \"the amount that we paid at the time of booking\" and that we can expect the refund in 3rd week of January 2025. \n\nHowever, since passing of 3rd week of Jan 2025, they have stopped responding and keep saying that they will send a final date soon. \n\nTldr: A family member booked a poolside wedding venue in Sec 56, Gurgaon, for July 7, 2024, paying ₹90,000 upfront (total ₹3,15,000). The salesperson promised a visit in November to view decorations and food tasting, but after delays, they finally scheduled it for Dec 4. Upon visiting, the venue was in terrible condition—dirty, torn furniture, and no proper setup despite an ongoing event. The family decided to cancel, however they had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. Upon negotiations, the family got an email confirmation of a refund with the venue management. The venue promised a refund by mid-Jan 2025 but has since stopped responding and delayed giving a final refund date. \n\nWhat legal steps can the family take to recover this amount? \n\n",

It’s going to be little long but he actually needs help so please read\n\nHe met a girl in 2019 they fell in love and started living together later he got to know that she was married but she said they got divorced and he trusted her! Then 6 months into the relationship she was after him to get married within 5-10 days as her mother was sick and there won’t be any auspicious day after 30th of some month i don’t remember. He tried to explain her that marriage doesn’t happen quickly and he doesn’t earn enough to be married and he also want big wedding someday! But she kept forcing him by saying I don’t care about big wedding i want small wedding!\nIt was just after lockdown and they got married in Arya samaj.\n\nAfter 1 year of marriage she started behaving controlling like leave your friends stay home with me all the time! Mind that she was 5-6 years older to him, he didn’t want to leave his friends and wanted to drink occasionally  with his friends but whenever he made plans she threatened him by saying i will jump from the building or i will cut my hand!\n\nBefore this threatening happened, my friend bought a house on his name and made his wife the nominee! But later on he could not take all this and he ran off!\n\nIt’s been 3 years since he has left his own home! She took all the stuff from the house which had some very expensive stuff also! She took property papers too which is in her bank locker! \n\nWhen she didn’t respond to mutual divorce! My friend met a girl and have been living with her and wants to marry her so he decided to talk to an advocate! Now he got to know she was married before but never divorced her first husband! Lawyer told him if my friend wants to marry again he can but he needs to forget about his own house any all the stuff including money in joint account with her!\n\nNow finally his wife filled a complaint saying he tortured her basically 498 or something! And she also included his mother and sister in it when he has been living away from family for past 11 years and she met the family twice only that too for lunch or dinner only!\n\nSo he wants to know that she can take away his home and joint account money? Which is his only asset as his family doesn’t talk to him and have nothing else. And as she is not divorced before so can she still claim everything ?",

I contacted them via email regarding the same and I was shocked by their reply. They said and I quote - \n\n\"I'm sorry to hear about the damage to your product. Unfortunately, according to our policy, we do not provide a warranty if the product is damaged or lost due to improper use. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.\"\n\nIt's not even due to outside damage or misuse which they mention in their warranty terms, it's literally the cheap quality of plastic used in the headband. Also if it's not covered under the warranty claim, then why replace them for customers outside of India? This is a well known defect and they've very much acknowledged it in the past as well, I am positively mystified at this remark.\n\nIs there something I can do legally to get them to honor this warranty claim?

She discovered that massive, decades-old trees on the school campus had been cut down.\n\n\n2. The school headmaster had permission to cut only one dead/dried-out tree and this was done by the concerned authorities by following the procedure few days back\n\n\n3. But yesterday (26/1/25) me and my mom saw that the headmaster has illegally cut two healthy trees without proper authorization (she wasn't present at the sight) and we have a video evidence of the man admitting that the headmaster has payed him to cut.\n\n\n4. The wood from these trees is very valuable and is intended for personal profit.\n\n\n5. As per procedure, tree-felling requires permission from BBMP or the Karnataka Forest Department, who also handle the cutting and removal process. This wasn’t followed.\n\n\n6. My mother recorded videos of the site as evidence and is considering filing a complaint.\n\n\n\nMy Concerns:\n\nIf my mother or I escalate this (e.g., filing a complaint or posting on Twitter), could we face any legal trouble or retaliation from the school/headmaster?\n\nIs there any other legal procedure or body we should approach to address this?\n\n\nKey Questions for Advice:\n\n1. What are the potential legal risks for us if we take this forward?\n\n\n2. What steps should we take to ensure this is handled legally and safely?\n\n\n3. Is there any way to ensure anonymity for my mother while filing the complaint? I'm planning to post this on X(twitter) since benguluru police are active there from what I know ",

I'm happy to learn and discuss. 😊\n\n# Uttarakhand Implements Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in 2024\n\nThe Uttarakhand government has introduced the **Uniform Civil Code (UCC)**, making it the first Indian state to adopt a unified legal framework for all its residents. This law simplifies and regulates matters like **marriage, divorce, inheritance**, and **live-in relationships**, ensuring everyone is treated equally under the same set of laws, regardless of their religion or cultural practices.\n\n# Key Points of the UCC\n\n1. **Marriage Rules:**\n   * Both partners must be **unmarried** at the time of marriage.\n   * Minimum age for marriage: **21 years for men, 18 years for women.**\n   * Marriage between close relatives (prohibited relationships) is not allowed unless permitted by specific customs, and those customs must not go against public policy.\n2. **Polygamy Banned:**\n   * Polygamy is **prohibited for everyone**, including communities where it was previously allowed (e.g., Muslim personal laws).\n   * Only **monogamous marriages** will be legally valid under the UCC.\n3. **Mandatory Marriage Registration:**\n   * Every marriage, even if solemnized outside Uttarakhand, must be registered with the authorities if at least one partner is a resident of the state.\n   * Marriages conducted since **2010** must also be registered retroactively.\n4. **Live-in Relationships:**\n   * Couples in live-in relationships must register their partnership within **30 days** of living together.\n   * **Children born from live-in relationships are considered legitimate** and will have inheritance rights.\n   * Women deserted by live-in partners can claim **financial support (maintenance)** through the courts.\n5. **Equal Inheritance Rights:**\n   * Both sons and daughters are given **equal inheritance rights** to their parents’ property, ensuring gender equality.\n6. **Religious Freedom for Ceremonies:**\n   * Couples can marry following their own religious or customary traditions, such as **Saptapadi, Nikah, Holy Union**, or **Anand Karaj.**\n\n# Who Does It Apply To?\n\n* The UCC applies to **all residents of Uttarakhand**, even those living outside the state.\n* **Scheduled Tribes** and groups with **protected customary practices** under the Constitution are exempt from this Code.\n\n# What Changes Under the UCC?\n\nThe UCC replaces personal laws based on religion with a **common set of rules** for everyone. For example:\n\n* Practices like **polygamy** are no longer allowed.\n* There is now a standardized procedure for marriage, divorce, and property inheritance.\n* Women in both marriages and live-in relationships have clear legal protections.\n\nFINE AND IMPRISONMENT \n\n* Under the Uttarakhand UCC, 2024, failing to submit a live-in relationship statement can result in:\n\nFine: Up to ₹10,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 3 months.\n\nProviding false information or ignoring notices can lead to stricter penalties, including:\n\nFine: Up to ₹25,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 6 months.",

Here’s the situation:\n\n* My father already has a passport, but it expired 5 years ago.\n* He renewed his passport in 2009, and at that time, due to a misunderstanding, his name was recorded incorrectly. Specifically, his grandfather’s name (father's father's name) was included, resulting in a trimmed/abbreviated version of his actual name.\n* Now, his old passport has a name that doesn’t match his Aadhaar card or other documents.\n\nWe recently applied for a passport renewal and visited the Passport Seva Kendra with all the necessary documents for a name correction. However, the officer in charge put the application on hold and insisted that we update the name on his Aadhaar card to match the old passport.\n\nWhile changing the name on the Aadhaar card is possible, it would create a ripple effect, as many other documents (bank accounts, property papers, etc.) are linked to the current name on his Aadhaar. This is the name we prefer to maintain, as it’s consistent across all other documents.\n\nOur goal is to correct the name in the passport to match the Aadhaar card, rather than changing the Aadhaar card to match the old passport. Is there any way to achieve this? Has anyone faced a similar situation or have advice on how to resolve this issue?\n\nAny guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

My mom became physically abusive, and my family started saying awful things to me—things I never imagined they’d say.**\n\n**I feel trapped. My family is now threatening to hurt both me and the person I want to stay in touch with if I leave or continue talking to him.

It’s in an unsafe condition, with structural instability, burnt debris, and residual oil spills. Despite this, the previous tenant is trying to resume operations there, posing serious risks to public safety.\n\nHere’s what has happened so far:\n\n1. A grievance was filed with the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office, and the issue was forwarded to the District Joint Director (LSGD) and then to the Panchayat.\n\n1. The Panchayat’s investigation report merely stated that “the building is partially ruined” without addressing concerns like structural instability or chemical hazards. No actions have been taken so far.\n\n1. The grievance was closed by the Joint Director's office without verifying if the Panchayat's response addressed the concerns or if any appropriate action was taken.\n\n1. When approached, the Panchayat, the officials said that the Panchayat isn’t responsible for stopping businesses from operating in unsafe premises, but they didn’t clarify which authority is.\n\nI’m not sure what to do next. I’ve contacted multiple authorities, but no action has been taken so far.\n\nMy questions:\n\n* Which authority is responsible for preventing businesses from operating in unsafe buildings in Kerala?\n\n* Should this be escalated to any higher authority?\n\n* Is there any foul play happening? Is that the reason no authority is taking any action?\n\n* How can I ensure that this matter is taken seriously and that action is initiated?\n\nI will attach photos of the burnt building for reference. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!\n\n ",

Since then, I have not gotten my car back. It’s been almost 9 months, and dealing with Zoomcar has been a nightmare.\n\nAfter repeated attempts to get in touch, their lawyer finally called me and informed me that my car has been impounded by the Bihar police. Apparently, the person who rented my car used it to smuggle a huge quantity of alcohol. Since the smuggler wasn’t caught during the incident, they charged me—the car owner—as an accused.\n\nThe lawyer told me I need to:\n\nGo to Bihar to get bail for my name.\nFile cases in the civil court, DM court, and then the high court to get my car back.\n\nThey also said Zoomcar cannot help me further.\nI hired a lawyer to handle this, but after 9 months, there has been no progress. This situation has taken a massive toll on my mental health. My family, work, and studies are all suffering, and I’m experiencing severe anxiety and depression because of this ordeal.\n\nI feel completely helpless and stuck. Has anyone faced a similar issue or can guide me on what to do next? Are there any legal steps I can take against Zoomcar for their negligence or lack of support?\n\nAny advice or suggestions would mean the world to me. Thank you in advance!\n",

I’ve marked the old wire line with ----. Now, our neighbor also wants to shift the poles to the end of their land along the highway. The last two poles are on our land, forming a straight line perpendicular to the road.\n\nThey are saying it won’t be possible without our cooperation (but I know that even if we don’t shift our pole, which is already on our land away from the highway, the second pole near the highway is in the right place). We can't refuse outright because we live in a village and are expected to cooperate.\n\nThe issue is the total cost. The electricity department has quoted around **₹3.5 lakhs** for the shift. They say we will get an official receipt from the government. Since the poles are on the land of three families (including ours), our share of the cost would be around **₹1.2 lakhs**.\n\nI want to understand the process for this:\n\n1. Can they charge this much?\n2. Is it true that the electricity department installs new poles when shifting old ones?\n\n**Other info:**\n\n* **State**: Uk\n* Why shift - We currently have no problem with the poles being on our land since the area is used for farming. However, some neighbors have built buildings nearby, so they are the ones who want this shift.\n* The poles don’t supply electricity to the village (not sure), but I think they are primarily for factories using high-voltage lines.",

TREES THAT DID NOT EVEN HAVE ANY BRANCHES TOUCHING OR NEAR THE WIRES HAVE BEEN CUT DOWN. \nI spoke to the people cutting it down and they said that some was for the MCF work, but the society families have also come and requested them to cut extra without telling anyone. \n\nWhat can I do here? \n\nIt's painful to see. It's so incredibly wrong. 20+ years of strong, beautiful, lush green trees just cut down. These stupid men and women don't realise that these very trees provided shade in summers, which are increasingly unbearable each year. \n\nI want to slap some legal on the society management so that they know things dont go without consequences. Please help in case anyone has an idea. Thanks a lot in advance. ",

        "selftext": "We are a Muslim family from Maharashtra, and I am sharing my sister’s painful story. She was married in 2020 through an arranged marriage. The groom’s family seemed educated but turned out to be extremely controlling and orthodox. From the very first day, my sister faced mental and physical abuse.\n\nHere’s what she went through:\n\n1. **No Freedom from Day One:** On the first day after her wedding, her in-laws took away her phone and sent it back to us. When she asked her husband, he told her that daughters-in-law in their house are not allowed to have phones and she should use his phone instead. To avoid arguments, my sister gave up her phone and her connection to the outside world.\n2. **Total Control Over Her Life:** Her in-laws controlled everything—what she wore, who she talked to, what she ate, even how and when she laughed.\n3. **No Respect in Her Marriage:** Her husband ignored her completely. He spent most of his time with a girl named \"Gudiya,\" who lived with the family but wasn’t related to them. Shockingly, they even shared my sister’s bed while she was forced to sleep on the floor. He avoided talking to her and came home late at night to avoid any confrontation.\n4. **Her Career Dreams Crushed:** My sister is highly qualified (MA in Geography and B.Ed) and wanted to become a professor. Her husband was also a teacher before their marriage, so we thought he would support her dreams. But after marriage, she found out he had quit his job because his mother told him to. When she tried to prepare for exams like NET/SET, her sister-in-law created drama and stopped her from studying.\n5. **No Healthcare or Basic Dignity:** If she fell sick, she was mocked for being weak. They refused to take her to the doctor unless her condition was serious.\n6. **Gold and Dowry Demands:** Her in-laws constantly praised their elder daughter-in-law for bringing dowry and gold every month. They took all the gold my sister brought with her and kept it in a bank without her consent.\n\nShe silently endured this abuse for two years before finally telling us everything. We immediately filed a domestic violence case against her in-laws and husband.\n\n**Legal Struggles**\n\nSince filing the case, her in-laws have avoided every court hearing by manipulating the police and the system. Over a year has passed, and they haven’t attended a single hearing. Meanwhile, my sister has to go to every hearing, reliving her trauma.\n\nEven when a non-bailable warrant was issued, they managed to escape. Their lawyer even got permission for them to skip court appearances. The judge handling the case seems hesitant to take any action, leaving my sister stuck.\n\nTo make things worse, during this time, her husband secretly married another woman without my sister’s consent. While he lives happily, my sister is left to deal with endless legal battles and mental pain.\n\nWe once thought of settling the matter out of court to get her a divorce, but her in-laws refused. They want to “set an example” for other daughters-in-law, showing what happens if they speak out.\n\n**We are desperate for help.** All we want is for my sister to get a divorce and move on with her life.\n\n**Questions We Need Help With:**\n\n1. How can we speed up the court process and make sure her in-laws and husband are held responsible?\n2. What legal steps can we take to secure a divorce and protect her future?\n3. How do we fight the manipulation of the police and courts by her in-laws?\n4. Can stricter action be taken against her husband for marrying another woman without her consent?\n\nPlease help us. My sister deserves a chance to live her life with dignity and hope.",

There was some advance money paid out by the builder and there was no development started by the developer in a long time.

I am facing a fundamental necessity issue, which is drinking water, for which they were supposed to put up a water purifier on the property. They provide water that the property's caretaker refills from another property, and a 20ltr can be used for five people. I have faced multiple issues, such as   \n1. Refilling the water from my friend's place.   \n2. No water available in the middle of the night  \n3. The caretaker not being available to get water, which I have to purchase from Blinkit  \n  \nI had raised multiple complaints with their support team, but they closed the ticket without providing an update or getting a customer response. Their customer service number is provided on the website. I called multiple times, but no one answered the calls. Sometimes, someone responded, but they lack basic essentialnication and accountability. \n\nThe biggest culprit is the property manager; I am sure he has never visited the property. He does most of his work via phone like a mafia boss. Most of the time, he has made false promises and no accountability. Whenever an issue is raised in a call, he gives vague timelines like \"it will be done\". And the biggest irony is that there is only one property manager for the entire location. The support team mainly contacts the property manager to resolve tickets. IItis like a Ponzi scheme where the issue goes completely unheard. I am paying 30k as rent for one single room; I mean, there is a TV, a F#\\*\\*ING TV in the amenities, which is entirely useless but no Water Purifier. The management should be pretty dumb and lame to come up with this.\n\n  \nNow the reason I am facing eviction is I have already mentioned to the support team on email that I will be withholding my rent payment until my issue is fixed which they don't seem to care about as they closed those support tickets which I have raised saying the issue has been fixed but in ground reality nothing's been done. I am clear that when I signed the agreement Water Purifer was part of the amenities that they were supposed to provide. What should I do in this case?",

She didn't tell anything and all lies about her first husband being drunkard and so on. \nThings went downhill quickly with her living in my home— within 1 month my grandparents started losing things, theft, bad behavior, and targeting on property. Whenever dad is at home she acts like an angel with me and grandparents.\n\nGrandparents kicked her out within 1 month and my dad and she have lived separately since 2012 in a rented home.\n\nI am disabled and 90% deaf, and I live in the house my grandparents built in Bangalore. My dad visits daily to help me out with household chores.\n\nIn 2015, dad discovered she had an affair in her first marriage that led to her divorce. Even with dad she had affairs late night talks and dad once caught a guy in home when she was alone. She just brushed it off saying friends. \n\nIn 2017, she had lung cancer, which she made my dad financially supported for operation and recovery.\n\nIn 2018, she had medical treatment to conceive again and ended up having a child without my dad’s decision as well. We don't even know if the kid belongs to dad. She hid this news until the 6th month.\n\nIn 2021, they had a violent fight, leading to police involvement. She took the child and ran to Kerala. She’s using the child to emotionally blackmail dad and has sent legal notices to my address claiming dowry and demanding to live in my home. Despite her issues, people seem to side with her. She tried to barge into my home and dad tried to push her out, leading to my name being included in an FIR.\n\nNow, in 2025, a similar fight happened in their rental home and police were called again.\n\nShe’s sending more legal notices through lawyers in Kerala and demands my dad appear before the Kerala Vanitha Committee on a date. \nThis notice came through my home address and dad unknowingly signed and took the letter, later he was regretting he should not have taken in my home address. \n\nThe latest issue is that she wants to live in my home, as my dad has no income.\nAnd she wants dad to marry her in order to see the child or to be in peace, else she would work on creating issues. \n\nMy dad has a small 1BHK near Electronic City around agricultural land, but she refuses to live there and insists on coming to my home.\n\nShe is also trying to involve me in all this and I suspect she'll again try to enter my home forcefully to live in.\n\nI’m already struggling with my disability unable to work effectively, lost my future, and finances aspects, and now the added legal fees and headache are difficult to pay. \n\nMy home is still in my grandparents' name, and I need to settle a amount as per will with my dad's sister to own it in my name which i am yet to do. \n\nWhat can I legally do to stop her from sending these notices and pulling me into this mess?\nCan i send a return notice to not disturb me and my dad does not stay here in my home? \n\nI don’t want her to stay in my home. Should I send a response to the lawyer stating my dad doesn’t live with me full-time? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nI’m also worried for my dad, who is 58 and having knee issues and worsening health not sure what kind of trouble will he be in. \nHow can i help my dad here. I know he did msny mistakes. But he supports me and understand my issues and try to help me as much as possible. \n\nI have no one to approach or ask for help, no relatives would come in for help unless there is a death. ",

Some miscreants edited and leaked explicit pics of my sister. They also sent the images to us for blackmail. They messaged us using anonymous Instagram accounts. \n1. We tried to talk them out of it but they didn't respond positively. \n1. Since my sister was stressed, we were looking after her Insta account. \n1. Around the same time, my sister's old friend who had a new Instagram account also messaged her. We didn't know it was a friend. We thought it was one of the miscreants. Some rude messages were exchanged and then that person (friend) stopped. \n1. We filed an FIR against all the 4 anonymous Insta accounts. \n1. The police got their real names from Meta company. \n1. We also managed to get the names of the account owners from the cops. 2 people who had a quarrel with my sister and 1 old friend (that's how we came to know about the friend's new account). \n1. The friend also got a call from the police and then called us to explain. \n\nSo now, we have a situation where we named an friendly innocent person (along with the real culprits)  in the FIR. \n\nHow can we resolve the situation with minimum trouble to our friend? We don't want the friend to go through the pain of the legal process. ",

        "selftext": "\n\nI need advice regarding my eligibility for a teaching post and whether I should pursue a court case to claim the position. Here’s my situation:\n\n1. Background:\n\nI applied for a teaching post where the notification mentioned that only candidates with a B.Ed. in Special Education are eligible.\n\nHowever, I knew the qualifications mentioned in the notification were incomplete because, based on past vacancies, candidates with a graduation + special diploma (recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India, RCI) were also eligible.\n\nThe RCI is the only body authorized to decide eligibility criteria for such posts, not the government.\n\n\n\n2. My Qualifications at the Time:\n\nI had a special diploma and was pursuing my graduation. However, my graduation was incomplete at the time of application.\n\nDespite this, I filled out the form, sat for the exam, and scored more than 20 marks above the cutoff (in the 2x result list).\n\n\n\n3. Current Scenario:\n\nI did not attend document verification because I had not completed my graduation by the last date of application, as per the notification’s criteria. , also government was only allowing special bed candidates\n\nMeanwhile, the government sought clarification from the RCI regarding qualifications, and the RCI confirmed that diploma holders (like me) are also valid for the post.\n\nAnd after 6-8 months due to some answers get changed, 2x result was canceled, and a new, fresh result was released today. My roll number is still in this list.\n\n\n\n4. Dilemma:\n\nThe notification clearly stated that all qualifications must be completed by the last date of application, which I did not meet.\n\nHowever, I believe I am eligible for the post based on RCI's clarification and past precedence.\n\nI desperately need this job, and I worked incredibly hard for it.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\nDo I have a strong case if I file a court petition?\n\nWhat legal arguments can I make to strengthen my case?\n\nAre there any past judgments or legal principles that could support my claim?\n\n\nI understand my chances might be slim, but I want to explore all possible options. Your guidance would mean a lot to me.\n\nThank you!\n\n.\n\n",

Unfortunately, all the items had some issue or the other in terms of size and fit so I decided to return it. I raised a request to return the items on 30th Dec and my order was picked up by a Delhivery guy on 31st Dec 2024. The person who picked it up was behaving very strangely. As he went through each item to confirm everything was there with all tags intact, he kept asking me the total value of the order and saying \"Ye order toh kaafi mehenga hoga na madam?\" \nI didn't respond and asked him to verify if it was him who was supposed to pick it up. And he said yes and that it was his first day of work so he is new to all this. I verified his phone number from the Delhivery app and then handed him my entire parcel. I later got an email from Delhivery that day that my order was picked up. \n\nOn 3rd Jan 2025, I received and email from Delhivery that my parcel was returned to Zara warehouse. Usually, when we return items to Zara, we get an email from them confirming that they have received it and the refund will be processed. I kept waiting for that email but didn't get one. I contacted Zara's customer service on 10th Jan 2025 and they told me they had only received one sweater in the parcel and it was a non-Zara item so they will not be giving me a refund. I have been chasing them ever since through calls every other day and their executives keep telling me to wait for 24-48 hours as my case has been expedited. But it's going to be month since I returned all the items. \n\nI have my suspicions that the Delhivery pickup guy stole my parcel and handed them random item. But I have not even been able to reach out to Delhivery since they deactivate their AWBs within 15 days. And their automated customer service says to contact the seller. And Zara has been utterly useless in those terms. \n\nI really need my money back. \n\nIs this worth filing a case in consumer court? How can we do it? Or is there any other way I can get them to give my refund. ",

        "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nThanks in advance for reading this huge wall of text :)\n\nA family member of mine booked a wedding hall/banquet situated in Sec 56 Gurgaon on July 7th 2024. They paid 90000 as a booking amount of the total Rs 3,15,000 (Food and Venue only, no decoration.). \n\nThey had booked the pool side venue, however at the time of booking, the pool was operational for members and functions were not being conducted. The Salesperson told us that we can come in November to look at their poolside functions to finalize our decoration.\n\nFast forward to end of November, we had not heard anything from the sales person, and after following up with her multiple times to give us a time to visit the venue for tasting and to see the decoration, she finally gave us a date of Dec 4th. She had informed us that there would be a wedding function in the eve of 4th Dec where we can see sample decoration and taste the food. \n\nWhen on Dec 4th we reached the venue, it was in an ABYSSMAL condition. It looked like they were taking apart the decoration instead of putting it up. Keep in mind that we went there at 8 pm, and the wedding guests had almost started to arrive. \n\nThe entire venue was covered in used straws and disposable spoons/plates, maybe from the day before function and nobody had bothered cleaning it up. The sofa for the bride and groom was dirty and torn and had food/stains marks all over. The low chairs for the bride and groom during pheras, were dirty, and had holes in them. Without getting into more details, it was a very horrible setup.\n\nNow based on all of this, we decided to confront the sales lady (who had been trying to avoid us the entire time btw), and we told them to cancel the venue. \n\nWe had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. With to and fro with the venue management, we were able to get them to send an email to us stating that they will refund \"the amount that we paid at the time of booking\" and that we can expect the refund in 3rd week of January 2025. \n\nHowever, since passing of 3rd week of Jan 2025, they have stopped responding and keep saying that they will send a final date soon. \n\nTldr: A family member booked a poolside wedding venue in Sec 56, Gurgaon, for July 7, 2024, paying ₹90,000 upfront (total ₹3,15,000). The salesperson promised a visit in November to view decorations and food tasting, but after delays, they finally scheduled it for Dec 4. Upon visiting, the venue was in terrible condition—dirty, torn furniture, and no proper setup despite an ongoing event. The family decided to cancel, however they had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. Upon negotiations, the family got an email confirmation of a refund with the venue management. The venue promised a refund by mid-Jan 2025 but has since stopped responding and delayed giving a final refund date. \n\nWhat legal steps can the family take to recover this amount? \n\n",

It’s going to be little long but he actually needs help so please read\n\nHe met a girl in 2019 they fell in love and started living together later he got to know that she was married but she said they got divorced and he trusted her! Then 6 months into the relationship she was after him to get married within 5-10 days as her mother was sick and there won’t be any auspicious day after 30th of some month i don’t remember. He tried to explain her that marriage doesn’t happen quickly and he doesn’t earn enough to be married and he also want big wedding someday! But she kept forcing him by saying I don’t care about big wedding i want small wedding!\nIt was just after lockdown and they got married in Arya samaj.\n\nAfter 1 year of marriage she started behaving controlling like leave your friends stay home with me all the time! Mind that she was 5-6 years older to him, he didn’t want to leave his friends and wanted to drink occasionally  with his friends but whenever he made plans she threatened him by saying i will jump from the building or i will cut my hand!\n\nBefore this threatening happened, my friend bought a house on his name and made his wife the nominee! But later on he could not take all this and he ran off!\n\nIt’s been 3 years since he has left his own home! She took all the stuff from the house which had some very expensive stuff also! She took property papers too which is in her bank locker! \n\nWhen she didn’t respond to mutual divorce! My friend met a girl and have been living with her and wants to marry her so he decided to talk to an advocate! Now he got to know she was married before but never divorced her first husband! Lawyer told him if my friend wants to marry again he can but he needs to forget about his own house any all the stuff including money in joint account with her!\n\nNow finally his wife filled a complaint saying he tortured her basically 498 or something! And she also included his mother and sister in it when he has been living away from family for past 11 years and she met the family twice only that too for lunch or dinner only!\n\nSo he wants to know that she can take away his home and joint account money? Which is his only asset as his family doesn’t talk to him and have nothing else. And as she is not divorced before so can she still claim everything ?",

Unfortunately, according to our policy, we do not provide a warranty if the product is damaged or lost due to improper use. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.\"\n\nIt's not even due to outside damage or misuse which they mention in their warranty terms, it's literally the cheap quality of plastic used in the headband. Also if it's not covered under the warranty claim, then why replace them for customers outside of India? This is a well known defect and they've very much acknowledged it in the past as well, I am positively mystified at this remark.\n\nIs there something I can do legally to get them to honor this warranty claim?

She discovered that massive, decades-old trees on the school campus had been cut down.\n\n\n2. The school headmaster had permission to cut only one dead/dried-out tree and this was done by the concerned authorities by following the procedure few days back\n\n\n3.

The wood from these trees is very valuable and is intended for personal profit.\n\n\n5. As per procedure, tree-felling requires permission from BBMP or the Karnataka Forest Department, who also handle the cutting and removal process. This wasn’t followed.\n\n\n6. My mother recorded videos of the site as evidence and is considering filing a complaint.\n\n\n\nMy Concerns:\n\nIf my mother or I escalate this (e.g., filing a complaint or posting on Twitter), could we face any legal trouble or retaliation from the school/headmaster?\n\nIs there any other legal procedure or body we should approach to address this?\n\n\nKey Questions for Advice:\n\n1. What are the potential legal risks for us if we take this forward?\n\n\n2. What steps should we take to ensure this is handled legally and safely?\n\n\n3.

I gave and served my 1 month notice fully(as mentioned in the employement letter) and got the asset clearance form from them after a month and received no communication from their end since then for over 3-4 months, the HR department and the founder has stayed mum even after I served them a legal notice a few weeks back but I still have not received my FNF amount or any communication regarding it.\n\nWhat should be my next step? I have heard things in consumer court take alot of time and at this point mentally and financially I'm spent. There are other employees as well with their FNF not paid yet and no communication as well from the company, is there any way labour court can be reached etc? Kindly suggest ",

The location is Uttar Pradesh (Ghaziabad).\n\nI have a few questions regarding property ownership:\n\t1.\tIf a son and mother are joint owners of a property, and the son suddenly passes away, who becomes the owner of the property? The son is survived by a wife; will the property now be jointly owned by both the mother and the daughter-in-law?\n\n\t2.\tWhen the property was registered, both the son and the mother were listed as joint owners. However, it was mentioned that the registry included a discount due to the woman’s ownership. Does this imply that the registry is in the mother’s name, and that the property will be transferred solely to her?\n\n\t3.\tIf the property is transferred to the mother’s name, does the daughter-in-law have any rights to it?\n\n\t4.\tIf the mother ultimately receives the property, can she transfer it as a gift to her daughter in order to prevent the daughter-in-law from acquiring any rights to it?\n\nLooking forward to any insights!",

        "selftext": "This post is based on my understanding of the **Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill, 2024**. If there are any mistakes or inaccuracies, please let me know in the comments! I'm happy to learn and discuss. 😊\n\n# Uttarakhand Implements Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in 2024\n\nThe Uttarakhand government has introduced the **Uniform Civil Code (UCC)**, making it the first Indian state to adopt a unified legal framework for all its residents. This law simplifies and regulates matters like **marriage, divorce, inheritance**, and **live-in relationships**, ensuring everyone is treated equally under the same set of laws, regardless of their religion or cultural practices.\n\n# Key Points of the UCC\n\n1. **Marriage Rules:**\n   * Both partners must be **unmarried** at the time of marriage.\n   * Minimum age for marriage: **21 years for men, 18 years for women.**\n   * Marriage between close relatives (prohibited relationships) is not allowed unless permitted by specific customs, and those customs must not go against public policy.\n2. **Polygamy Banned:**\n   * Polygamy is **prohibited for everyone**, including communities where it was previously allowed (e.g., Muslim personal laws).\n   * Only **monogamous marriages** will be legally valid under the UCC.\n3. **Mandatory Marriage Registration:**\n   * Every marriage, even if solemnized outside Uttarakhand, must be registered with the authorities if at least one partner is a resident of the state.\n   * Marriages conducted since **2010** must also be registered retroactively.\n4. **Live-in Relationships:**\n   * Couples in live-in relationships must register their partnership within **30 days** of living together.\n   * **Children born from live-in relationships are considered legitimate** and will have inheritance rights.\n   * Women deserted by live-in partners can claim **financial support (maintenance)** through the courts.\n5. **Equal Inheritance Rights:**\n   * Both sons and daughters are given **equal inheritance rights** to their parents’ property, ensuring gender equality.\n6. **Religious Freedom for Ceremonies:**\n   * Couples can marry following their own religious or customary traditions, such as **Saptapadi, Nikah, Holy Union**, or **Anand Karaj.**\n\n# Who Does It Apply To?\n\n* The UCC applies to **all residents of Uttarakhand**, even those living outside the state.\n* **Scheduled Tribes** and groups with **protected customary practices** under the Constitution are exempt from this Code.\n\n# What Changes Under the UCC?\n\nThe UCC replaces personal laws based on religion with a **common set of rules** for everyone. For example:\n\n* Practices like **polygamy** are no longer allowed.\n* There is now a standardized procedure for marriage, divorce, and property inheritance.\n* Women in both marriages and live-in relationships have clear legal protections.\n\nFINE AND IMPRISONMENT \n\n* Under the Uttarakhand UCC, 2024, failing to submit a live-in relationship statement can result in:\n\nFine: Up to ₹10,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 3 months.\n\nProviding false information or ignoring notices can lead to stricter penalties, including:\n\nFine: Up to ₹25,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 6 months.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI need assistance with a passport issue for my father. The problem is related to a name correction in his passport application. Here’s the situation:\n\n* My father already has a passport, but it expired 5 years ago.\n* He renewed his passport in 2009, and at that time, due to a misunderstanding, his name was recorded incorrectly. Specifically, his grandfather’s name (father's father's name) was included, resulting in a trimmed/abbreviated version of his actual name.\n* Now, his old passport has a name that doesn’t match his Aadhaar card or other documents.\n\nWe recently applied for a passport renewal and visited the Passport Seva Kendra with all the necessary documents for a name correction. However, the officer in charge put the application on hold and insisted that we update the name on his Aadhaar card to match the old passport.\n\nWhile changing the name on the Aadhaar card is possible, it would create a ripple effect, as many other documents (bank accounts, property papers, etc.) are linked to the current name on his Aadhaar. This is the name we prefer to maintain, as it’s consistent across all other documents.\n\nOur goal is to correct the name in the passport to match the Aadhaar card, rather than changing the Aadhaar card to match the old passport. Is there any way to achieve this? Has anyone faced a similar situation or have advice on how to resolve this issue?\n\nAny guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI need help understanding what to do in this situation.\n\nThere was a building located on in Kattakada, Thiruvananthapuram, that was severely damaged in a fire in May 2024. It’s in an unsafe condition, with structural instability, burnt debris, and residual oil spills. Despite this, the previous tenant is trying to resume operations there, posing serious risks to public safety.\n\nHere’s what has happened so far:\n\n1. A grievance was filed with the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office, and the issue was forwarded to the District Joint Director (LSGD) and then to the Panchayat.\n\n1. The Panchayat’s investigation report merely stated that “the building is partially ruined” without addressing concerns like structural instability or chemical hazards. No actions have been taken so far.\n\n1. The grievance was closed by the Joint Director's office without verifying if the Panchayat's response addressed the concerns or if any appropriate action was taken.\n\n1. When approached, the Panchayat, the officials said that the Panchayat isn’t responsible for stopping businesses from operating in unsafe premises, but they didn’t clarify which authority is.\n\nI’m not sure what to do next. I’ve contacted multiple authorities, but no action has been taken so far.\n\nMy questions:\n\n* Which authority is responsible for preventing businesses from operating in unsafe buildings in Kerala?\n\n* Should this be escalated to any higher authority?\n\n* Is there any foul play happening? Is that the reason no authority is taking any action?\n\n* How can I ensure that this matter is taken seriously and that action is initiated?\n\nI will attach photos of the burnt building for reference. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!\n\n ",

Since the smuggler wasn’t caught during the incident, they charged me—the car owner—as an accused.\n\nThe lawyer told me I need to:\n\nGo to Bihar to get bail for my name.\nFile cases in the civil court, DM court, and then the high court to get my car back.\n\nThey also said Zoomcar cannot help me further.\nI hired a lawyer to handle this, but after 9 months, there has been no progress.

My family, work, and studies are all suffering, and I’m experiencing severe anxiety and depression because of this ordeal.\n\nI feel completely helpless and stuck.

I’ve marked the old wire line with ----. Now, our neighbor also wants to shift the poles to the end of their land along the highway. The last two poles are on our land, forming a straight line perpendicular to the road.\n\nThey are saying it won’t be possible without our cooperation (but I know that even if we don’t shift our pole, which is already on our land away from the highway, the second pole near the highway is in the right place). We can't refuse outright because we live in a village and are expected to cooperate.\n\nThe issue is the total cost. The electricity department has quoted around **₹3.5 lakhs** for the shift. They say we will get an official receipt from the government. Since the poles are on the land of three families (including ours), our share of the cost would be around **₹1.2 lakhs**.\n\nI want to understand the process for this:\n\n1. Can they charge this much?\n2. Is it true that the electricity department installs new poles when shifting old ones?\n\n**Other info:**\n\n* **State**: Uk\n* Why shift - We currently have no problem with the poles being on our land since the area is used for farming. However, some neighbors have built buildings nearby, so they are the ones who want this shift.\n* The poles don’t supply electricity to the village (not sure), but I think they are primarily for factories using high-voltage lines.",

Well, okay. Assuming it is true, fine. \nBUT. \nThey have CLEARLY CUT SO MUCH MORE THAN NECESSARY. TREES THAT DID NOT EVEN HAVE ANY BRANCHES TOUCHING OR NEAR THE WIRES HAVE BEEN CUT DOWN. \nI spoke to the people cutting it down and they said that some was for the MCF work, but the society families have also come and requested them to cut extra without telling anyone. \n\nWhat can I do here? \n\nIt's painful to see. It's so incredibly wrong. 20+ years of strong, beautiful, lush green trees just cut down. These stupid men and women don't realise that these very trees provided shade in summers, which are increasingly unbearable each year. \n\nI want to slap some legal on the society management so that they know things dont go without consequences.

        "selftext": "We are a Muslim family from Maharashtra, and I am sharing my sister’s painful story. She was married in 2020 through an arranged marriage. The groom’s family seemed educated but turned out to be extremely controlling and orthodox. From the very first day, my sister faced mental and physical abuse.\n\nHere’s what she went through:\n\n1. **No Freedom from Day One:** On the first day after her wedding, her in-laws took away her phone and sent it back to us. When she asked her husband, he told her that daughters-in-law in their house are not allowed to have phones and she should use his phone instead. To avoid arguments, my sister gave up her phone and her connection to the outside world.\n2. **Total Control Over Her Life:** Her in-laws controlled everything—what she wore, who she talked to, what she ate, even how and when she laughed.\n3. **No Respect in Her Marriage:** Her husband ignored her completely. He spent most of his time with a girl named \"Gudiya,\" who lived with the family but wasn’t related to them. Shockingly, they even shared my sister’s bed while she was forced to sleep on the floor. He avoided talking to her and came home late at night to avoid any confrontation.\n4. **Her Career Dreams Crushed:** My sister is highly qualified (MA in Geography and B.Ed) and wanted to become a professor. Her husband was also a teacher before their marriage, so we thought he would support her dreams. But after marriage, she found out he had quit his job because his mother told him to. When she tried to prepare for exams like NET/SET, her sister-in-law created drama and stopped her from studying.\n5. **No Healthcare or Basic Dignity:** If she fell sick, she was mocked for being weak. They refused to take her to the doctor unless her condition was serious.\n6. **Gold and Dowry Demands:** Her in-laws constantly praised their elder daughter-in-law for bringing dowry and gold every month. They took all the gold my sister brought with her and kept it in a bank without her consent.\n\nShe silently endured this abuse for two years before finally telling us everything. We immediately filed a domestic violence case against her in-laws and husband.\n\n**Legal Struggles**\n\nSince filing the case, her in-laws have avoided every court hearing by manipulating the police and the system. Over a year has passed, and they haven’t attended a single hearing. Meanwhile, my sister has to go to every hearing, reliving her trauma.\n\nEven when a non-bailable warrant was issued, they managed to escape. Their lawyer even got permission for them to skip court appearances. The judge handling the case seems hesitant to take any action, leaving my sister stuck.\n\nTo make things worse, during this time, her husband secretly married another woman without my sister’s consent. While he lives happily, my sister is left to deal with endless legal battles and mental pain.\n\nWe once thought of settling the matter out of court to get her a divorce, but her in-laws refused. They want to “set an example” for other daughters-in-law, showing what happens if they speak out.\n\n**We are desperate for help.** All we want is for my sister to get a divorce and move on with her life.\n\n**Questions We Need Help With:**\n\n1. How can we speed up the court process and make sure her in-laws and husband are held responsible?\n2. What legal steps can we take to secure a divorce and protect her future?\n3. How do we fight the manipulation of the police and courts by her in-laws?\n4. Can stricter action be taken against her husband for marrying another woman without her consent?\n\nPlease help us. My sister deserves a chance to live her life with dignity and hope.",

I can't imagine this ending in any way other than divorce. Whether it's next week or 5 years from now, it will happen.\n\nQuestion: How do I keep myself prepared. I know I can contact a divorce lawyer, but what about other things like removing her as the beneficiary from my investments, how do I handle my daughter's schooling, what about all the documents where she is mentioned as my wife. Would a divorce lawyer help me with these?\n\nIn case it matters, we are Muslims. No official marriage certificate but there's a nikahnama and her name is on my passport.",

One of the second generation hier is educated while the rest are not(let’s call him and his kin A and the rest XYZ). This has caused a lot of issues over the years which I will summarise in points. Please feel free to give any info about individual points as well. \n\n1) So A is the only one in possession of the original will and all other survey papers (at least claims to be) and with his he is always encroaching everyone’s property by stating that XYZ have built houses outside the boundaries. \n\nI figure I can get the survey results through a legal process, but the will and other documents, is there a legal process to request him to share all documents that he claims to be the sources with others?\n\n2) A and XYZ agreed to give the said property to a builder for development purposes in 2001. There was some advance money paid out by the builder and there was no development started by the developer in a long time. Since XYZ had no employment, they took out several more advances throughout the years from the said builder, now 20 years later, there is still no development and even though we’re willing to pay the money back (even with interest) the developer isn’t make any progress. \n\nWhat can we do in this situation? \n\nThis has been going on since I was a kid and now I earn quite well and I want to help my dad using some money I can spend. It’s been really hard to see him struggle with his relatives. Any input or suggestions of legal teams are welcome! Thank you for taking the time to read!  ",

        "selftext": "Hi,   \n  \nI want to know certain things. I have been living in rent in a property managed by The Helloworld Coliving in Mumbai. I am facing a fundamental necessity issue, which is drinking water, for which they were supposed to put up a water purifier on the property. They provide water that the property's caretaker refills from another property, and a 20ltr can be used for five people. I have faced multiple issues, such as   \n1. Refilling the water from my friend's place.   \n2. No water available in the middle of the night  \n3. The caretaker not being available to get water, which I have to purchase from Blinkit  \n  \nI had raised multiple complaints with their support team, but they closed the ticket without providing an update or getting a customer response. Their customer service number is provided on the website. I called multiple times, but no one answered the calls. Sometimes, someone responded, but they lack basic essentialnication and accountability. \n\nThe biggest culprit is the property manager; I am sure he has never visited the property. He does most of his work via phone like a mafia boss. Most of the time, he has made false promises and no accountability. Whenever an issue is raised in a call, he gives vague timelines like \"it will be done\". And the biggest irony is that there is only one property manager for the entire location. The support team mainly contacts the property manager to resolve tickets. IItis like a Ponzi scheme where the issue goes completely unheard. I am paying 30k as rent for one single room; I mean, there is a TV, a F#\\*\\*ING TV in the amenities, which is entirely useless but no Water Purifier. The management should be pretty dumb and lame to come up with this.\n\n  \nNow the reason I am facing eviction is I have already mentioned to the support team on email that I will be withholding my rent payment until my issue is fixed which they don't seem to care about as they closed those support tickets which I have raised saying the issue has been fixed but in ground reality nothing's been done. I am clear that when I signed the agreement Water Purifer was part of the amenities that they were supposed to provide. What should I do in this case?",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI need some legal advice regarding a complicated situation.\n\nBackground: I come from a lower-income family. My mother left me immediately when I was born due to psychiatric issues and has lived with her parents for over 25 years. Dad tried applying for divorce, but with no address, no answer or response, he didn't get the divorce. I grew up with my father’s parents, who passed away in 2018.\n\nAfter 15+ years of waiting, My dad (58) found a live-in partner in 2010 who agreed to live without divorce or marriage initially.. She (40) a divorcee with two kids from her first marriage. She didn't tell anything and all lies about her first husband being drunkard and so on. \nThings went downhill quickly with her living in my home— within 1 month my grandparents started losing things, theft, bad behavior, and targeting on property. Whenever dad is at home she acts like an angel with me and grandparents.\n\nGrandparents kicked her out within 1 month and my dad and she have lived separately since 2012 in a rented home.\n\nI am disabled and 90% deaf, and I live in the house my grandparents built in Bangalore. My dad visits daily to help me out with household chores.\n\nIn 2015, dad discovered she had an affair in her first marriage that led to her divorce. Even with dad she had affairs late night talks and dad once caught a guy in home when she was alone. She just brushed it off saying friends. \n\nIn 2017, she had lung cancer, which she made my dad financially supported for operation and recovery.\n\nIn 2018, she had medical treatment to conceive again and ended up having a child without my dad’s decision as well. We don't even know if the kid belongs to dad. She hid this news until the 6th month.\n\nIn 2021, they had a violent fight, leading to police involvement. She took the child and ran to Kerala. She’s using the child to emotionally blackmail dad and has sent legal notices to my address claiming dowry and demanding to live in my home. Despite her issues, people seem to side with her. She tried to barge into my home and dad tried to push her out, leading to my name being included in an FIR.\n\nNow, in 2025, a similar fight happened in their rental home and police were called again.\n\nShe’s sending more legal notices through lawyers in Kerala and demands my dad appear before the Kerala Vanitha Committee on a date. \nThis notice came through my home address and dad unknowingly signed and took the letter, later he was regretting he should not have taken in my home address. \n\nThe latest issue is that she wants to live in my home, as my dad has no income.\nAnd she wants dad to marry her in order to see the child or to be in peace, else she would work on creating issues. \n\nMy dad has a small 1BHK near Electronic City around agricultural land, but she refuses to live there and insists on coming to my home.\n\nShe is also trying to involve me in all this and I suspect she'll again try to enter my home forcefully to live in.\n\nI’m already struggling with my disability unable to work effectively, lost my future, and finances aspects, and now the added legal fees and headache are difficult to pay. \n\nMy home is still in my grandparents' name, and I need to settle a amount as per will with my dad's sister to own it in my name which i am yet to do. \n\nWhat can I legally do to stop her from sending these notices and pulling me into this mess?\nCan i send a return notice to not disturb me and my dad does not stay here in my home? \n\nI don’t want her to stay in my home. Should I send a response to the lawyer stating my dad doesn’t live with me full-time? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nI’m also worried for my dad, who is 58 and having knee issues and worsening health not sure what kind of trouble will he be in. \nHow can i help my dad here. I know he did msny mistakes. But he supports me and understand my issues and try to help me as much as possible. \n\nI have no one to approach or ask for help, no relatives would come in for help unless there is a death. ",

Around the same time, my sister's old friend who had a new Instagram account also messaged her. We didn't know it was a friend. We thought it was one of the miscreants. Some rude messages were exchanged and then that person (friend) stopped. \n1. We filed an FIR against all the 4 anonymous Insta accounts. \n1. The police got their real names from Meta company. \n1.

Background:\n\nI applied for a teaching post where the notification mentioned that only candidates with a B.Ed. in Special Education are eligible.\n\nHowever, I knew the qualifications mentioned in the notification were incomplete because, based on past vacancies, candidates with a graduation + special diploma (recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India, RCI) were also eligible.\n\nThe RCI is the only body authorized to decide eligibility criteria for such posts, not the government.\n\n\n\n2.

As he went through each item to confirm everything was there with all tags intact, he kept asking me the total value of the order and saying \"Ye order toh kaafi mehenga hoga na madam?\" \nI didn't respond and asked him to verify if it was him who was supposed to pick it up. And he said yes and that it was his first day of work so he is new to all this. I verified his phone number from the Delhivery app and then handed him my entire parcel. I later got an email from Delhivery that day that my order was picked up. \n\nOn 3rd Jan 2025, I received and email from Delhivery that my parcel was returned to Zara warehouse. Usually, when we return items to Zara, we get an email from them confirming that they have received it and the refund will be processed. I kept waiting for that email but didn't get one. I contacted Zara's customer service on 10th Jan 2025 and they told me they had only received one sweater in the parcel and it was a non-Zara item so they will not be giving me a refund. I have been chasing them ever since through calls every other day and their executives keep telling me to wait for 24-48 hours as my case has been expedited. But it's going to be month since I returned all the items. \n\nI have my suspicions that the Delhivery pickup guy stole my parcel and handed them random item. But I have not even been able to reach out to Delhivery since they deactivate their AWBs within 15 days. And their automated customer service says to contact the seller. And Zara has been utterly useless in those terms. \n\nI really need my money back. \n\nIs this worth filing a case in consumer court? How can we do it? Or is there any other way I can get them to give my refund. ",

They paid 90000 as a booking amount of the total Rs 3,15,000 (Food and Venue only, no decoration.). \n\nThey had booked the pool side venue, however at the time of booking, the pool was operational for members and functions were not being conducted. The Salesperson told us that we can come in November to look at their poolside functions to finalize our decoration.\n\nFast forward to end of November, we had not heard anything from the sales person, and after following up with her multiple times to give us a time to visit the venue for tasting and to see the decoration, she finally gave us a date of Dec 4th. She had informed us that there would be a wedding function in the eve of 4th Dec where we can see sample decoration and taste the food. \n\nWhen on Dec 4th we reached the venue, it was in an ABYSSMAL condition. It looked like they were taking apart the decoration instead of putting it up. Keep in mind that we went there at 8 pm, and the wedding guests had almost started to arrive. \n\nThe entire venue was covered in used straws and disposable spoons/plates, maybe from the day before function and nobody had bothered cleaning it up. The sofa for the bride and groom was dirty and torn and had food/stains marks all over. The low chairs for the bride and groom during pheras, were dirty, and had holes in them. Without getting into more details, it was a very horrible setup.\n\nNow based on all of this, we decided to confront the sales lady (who had been trying to avoid us the entire time btw), and we told them to cancel the venue. \n\nWe had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. With to and fro with the venue management, we were able to get them to send an email to us stating that they will refund \"the amount that we paid at the time of booking\" and that we can expect the refund in 3rd week of January 2025. \n\nHowever, since passing of 3rd week of Jan 2025, they have stopped responding and keep saying that they will send a final date soon. \n\nTldr: A family member booked a poolside wedding venue in Sec 56, Gurgaon, for July 7, 2024, paying ₹90,000 upfront (total ₹3,15,000). The salesperson promised a visit in November to view decorations and food tasting, but after delays, they finally scheduled it for Dec 4. Upon visiting, the venue was in terrible condition—dirty, torn furniture, and no proper setup despite an ongoing event. The family decided to cancel, however they had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. Upon negotiations, the family got an email confirmation of a refund with the venue management. The venue promised a refund by mid-Jan 2025 but has since stopped responding and delayed giving a final refund date. \n\nWhat legal steps can the family take to recover this amount? \n\n",

        "selftext": "Married woman, married another man without divorce \n\nHi, this happened to my friend as he is not on reddit i decided to post on his behalf for some information. It’s going to be little long but he actually needs help so please read\n\nHe met a girl in 2019 they fell in love and started living together later he got to know that she was married but she said they got divorced and he trusted her! Then 6 months into the relationship she was after him to get married within 5-10 days as her mother was sick and there won’t be any auspicious day after 30th of some month i don’t remember. He tried to explain her that marriage doesn’t happen quickly and he doesn’t earn enough to be married and he also want big wedding someday! But she kept forcing him by saying I don’t care about big wedding i want small wedding!\nIt was just after lockdown and they got married in Arya samaj.\n\nAfter 1 year of marriage she started behaving controlling like leave your friends stay home with me all the time! Mind that she was 5-6 years older to him, he didn’t want to leave his friends and wanted to drink occasionally  with his friends but whenever he made plans she threatened him by saying i will jump from the building or i will cut my hand!\n\nBefore this threatening happened, my friend bought a house on his name and made his wife the nominee! But later on he could not take all this and he ran off!\n\nIt’s been 3 years since he has left his own home! She took all the stuff from the house which had some very expensive stuff also! She took property papers too which is in her bank locker! \n\nWhen she didn’t respond to mutual divorce! My friend met a girl and have been living with her and wants to marry her so he decided to talk to an advocate! Now he got to know she was married before but never divorced her first husband! Lawyer told him if my friend wants to marry again he can but he needs to forget about his own house any all the stuff including money in joint account with her!\n\nNow finally his wife filled a complaint saying he tortured her basically 498 or something! And she also included his mother and sister in it when he has been living away from family for past 11 years and she met the family twice only that too for lunch or dinner only!\n\nSo he wants to know that she can take away his home and joint account money? Which is his only asset as his family doesn’t talk to him and have nothing else. And as she is not divorced before so can she still claim everything ?",

I looked it up and it seems like it's a relatively common QC issue in this particular model. There's plenty of proof here - [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/wx2opz/the_headband_on_my_q30_headphones_broke_after_a/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/lhcei6/soundcore_q30_design_flaw_the_plastic_clips_next/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/xlvwjj/another_broken_soundcore_q30/) [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/187blhc/soundcore_q30_part_broke/) [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/anker/comments/nv4jhk/my_soundcore_q30_broke_always_felt_right_side_was/)\n\nI contacted Anker regarding the 18 Month Warranty claim since a good few people got a new pair after the brittle plastic headband broke the same way, or at least that's what they claimed on their respective reddit threads. I contacted them via email regarding the same and I was shocked by their reply. They said and I quote - \n\n\"I'm sorry to hear about the damage to your product. Unfortunately, according to our policy, we do not provide a warranty if the product is damaged or lost due to improper use. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.\"\n\nIt's not even due to outside damage or misuse which they mention in their warranty terms, it's literally the cheap quality of plastic used in the headband. Also if it's not covered under the warranty claim, then why replace them for customers outside of India? This is a well known defect and they've very much acknowledged it in the past as well, I am positively mystified at this remark.\n\nIs there something I can do legally to get them to honor this warranty claim? Seems like they've shut down my ticket too.",

She discovered that massive, decades-old trees on the school campus had been cut down.\n\n\n2. The school headmaster had permission to cut only one dead/dried-out tree and this was done by the concerned authorities by following the procedure few days back\n\n\n3.

The wood from these trees is very valuable and is intended for personal profit.\n\n\n5.

The son is survived by a wife; will the property now be jointly owned by both the mother and the daughter-in-law?\n\n\t2.\tWhen the property was registered, both the son and the mother were listed as joint owners. However, it was mentioned that the registry included a discount due to the woman’s ownership. Does this imply that the registry is in the mother’s name, and that the property will be transferred solely to her?\n\n\t3.\tIf the property is transferred to the mother’s name, does the daughter-in-law have any rights to it?\n\n\t4.\tIf the mother ultimately receives the property, can she transfer it as a gift to her daughter in order to prevent the daughter-in-law from acquiring any rights to it?\n\nLooking forward to any insights!",

        "selftext": "I have been renting an apartment in Mumbai since December 2022. I initially signed up for one year, then renewed it twice for one year each (December 2023 and December 2024). So the latest agreement is over a month old.\n\nHowever, the landlord in question has not been paying the society maintenance charges for a year now. In addition, a couple of days ago, I also received a Property Tax Demand (Rs. 16K or so) from the BMC meaning he hasn't been paying that either. I have been forwarding these to him over WhatsApp.\n\nThe society office is on my side, and are asking me not to pay the rent for the next month (I planned to pay it as per schedule on Feb 5). They say this will put adequate pressure on him to turn up and clear their bill. Should I proceed with not paying?\n\nAlso, I don't want to deal with this headache anyway - can I just take the hit on my security deposit and walk away, no questions asked? The security deposit is worth approx 3 months of rent. The agreement has a clause saying there is a lock-in period of 6 months, but it also states in another part that the landlord is responsible for paying all the bills. \n\nWhat should I do?",

They rammed into my car and got heavily injured themselves and there was a lot of damage caused to my car as well. I called the police and went to the police station , filed the report and did all the necessary things. \n\nNow the issue is , the other party doesn’t wanna take the issue to the court , infact , they haven’t even contacted the police even once. Now my car is stuck in the police station. I got in contact with a lawyer and he said he’s gonna get a court order and get my car released but he’s demanding 20k for this procedure. \n\nWhat can I do in this scenario?

        "selftext": "This post is based on my understanding of the **Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill, 2024**. If there are any mistakes or inaccuracies, please let me know in the comments! I'm happy to learn and discuss. 😊\n\n# Uttarakhand Implements Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in 2024\n\nThe Uttarakhand government has introduced the **Uniform Civil Code (UCC)**, making it the first Indian state to adopt a unified legal framework for all its residents. This law simplifies and regulates matters like **marriage, divorce, inheritance**, and **live-in relationships**, ensuring everyone is treated equally under the same set of laws, regardless of their religion or cultural practices.\n\n# Key Points of the UCC\n\n1. **Marriage Rules:**\n   * Both partners must be **unmarried** at the time of marriage.\n   * Minimum age for marriage: **21 years for men, 18 years for women.**\n   * Marriage between close relatives (prohibited relationships) is not allowed unless permitted by specific customs, and those customs must not go against public policy.\n2. **Polygamy Banned:**\n   * Polygamy is **prohibited for everyone**, including communities where it was previously allowed (e.g., Muslim personal laws).\n   * Only **monogamous marriages** will be legally valid under the UCC.\n3. **Mandatory Marriage Registration:**\n   * Every marriage, even if solemnized outside Uttarakhand, must be registered with the authorities if at least one partner is a resident of the state.\n   * Marriages conducted since **2010** must also be registered retroactively.\n4. **Live-in Relationships:**\n   * Couples in live-in relationships must register their partnership within **30 days** of living together.\n   * **Children born from live-in relationships are considered legitimate** and will have inheritance rights.\n   * Women deserted by live-in partners can claim **financial support (maintenance)** through the courts.\n5. **Equal Inheritance Rights:**\n   * Both sons and daughters are given **equal inheritance rights** to their parents’ property, ensuring gender equality.\n6. **Religious Freedom for Ceremonies:**\n   * Couples can marry following their own religious or customary traditions, such as **Saptapadi, Nikah, Holy Union**, or **Anand Karaj.**\n\n# Who Does It Apply To?\n\n* The UCC applies to **all residents of Uttarakhand**, even those living outside the state.\n* **Scheduled Tribes** and groups with **protected customary practices** under the Constitution are exempt from this Code.\n\n# What Changes Under the UCC?\n\nThe UCC replaces personal laws based on religion with a **common set of rules** for everyone. For example:\n\n* Practices like **polygamy** are no longer allowed.\n* There is now a standardized procedure for marriage, divorce, and property inheritance.\n* Women in both marriages and live-in relationships have clear legal protections.\n\nFINE AND IMPRISONMENT \n\n* Under the Uttarakhand UCC, 2024, failing to submit a live-in relationship statement can result in:\n\nFine: Up to ₹10,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 3 months.\n\nProviding false information or ignoring notices can lead to stricter penalties, including:\n\nFine: Up to ₹25,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 6 months.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI need assistance with a passport issue for my father. The problem is related to a name correction in his passport application. Here’s the situation:\n\n* My father already has a passport, but it expired 5 years ago.\n* He renewed his passport in 2009, and at that time, due to a misunderstanding, his name was recorded incorrectly. Specifically, his grandfather’s name (father's father's name) was included, resulting in a trimmed/abbreviated version of his actual name.\n* Now, his old passport has a name that doesn’t match his Aadhaar card or other documents.\n\nWe recently applied for a passport renewal and visited the Passport Seva Kendra with all the necessary documents for a name correction. However, the officer in charge put the application on hold and insisted that we update the name on his Aadhaar card to match the old passport.\n\nWhile changing the name on the Aadhaar card is possible, it would create a ripple effect, as many other documents (bank accounts, property papers, etc.) are linked to the current name on his Aadhaar. This is the name we prefer to maintain, as it’s consistent across all other documents.\n\nOur goal is to correct the name in the passport to match the Aadhaar card, rather than changing the Aadhaar card to match the old passport. Is there any way to achieve this? Has anyone faced a similar situation or have advice on how to resolve this issue?\n\nAny guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\n",

I started developing feelings for him, and I wanted to keep him as a friend, so I could have him in my life. We began talking on WhatsApp, but I kept it hidden from my husband and family. Eventually, I introduced him to my husband and family, but they didn’t like him. However, he didn’t say anything about it at first.**\n\n**When my husband found out I’d been hiding messages, he got extremely angry and started getting violent with me. He says he loves me a lot and is possessive, telling me I shouldn’t talk to anyone else. I tried to fight back, saying I want to continue talking to this person, but then my husband told my family about everything, and things got worse. My mom became physically abusive, and my family started saying awful things to me—things I never imagined they’d say.**\n\n**I feel trapped. My family is now threatening to hurt both me and the person I want to stay in touch with if I leave or continue talking to him. I’m staying with my husband for the sake of my kids, even though I feel completely helpless. The person I wanted to talk to is no longer speaking to me, and my family completely hates both me and him now.**\n\n**I’m terrified to even reach out to him, as my husband is tracking my phone and messages and has been threatening me. I honestly don’t know what to do. All are ignoring me and not letting me leave as well. I feel stuck, scared, and like I have no way out. Does anyone have advice on how to navigate this?**",

It’s in an unsafe condition, with structural instability, burnt debris, and residual oil spills. Despite this, the previous tenant is trying to resume operations there, posing serious risks to public safety.\n\nHere’s what has happened so far:\n\n1. A grievance was filed with the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office, and the issue was forwarded to the District Joint Director (LSGD) and then to the Panchayat.\n\n1. The Panchayat’s investigation report merely stated that “the building is partially ruined” without addressing concerns like structural instability or chemical hazards. No actions have been taken so far.\n\n1. The grievance was closed by the Joint Director's office without verifying if the Panchayat's response addressed the concerns or if any appropriate action was taken.\n\n1. When approached, the Panchayat, the officials said that the Panchayat isn’t responsible for stopping businesses from operating in unsafe premises, but they didn’t clarify which authority is.\n\nI’m not sure what to do next. I’ve contacted multiple authorities, but no action has been taken so far.\n\nMy questions:\n\n* Which authority is responsible for preventing businesses from operating in unsafe buildings in Kerala?\n\n* Should this be escalated to any higher authority?\n\n* Is there any foul play happening? Is that the reason no authority is taking any action?\n\n* How can I ensure that this matter is taken seriously and that action is initiated?\n\nI will attach photos of the burnt building for reference. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!\n\n ",

Apparently, the person who rented my car used it to smuggle a huge quantity of alcohol. Since the smuggler wasn’t caught during the incident, they charged me—the car owner—as an accused.\n\nThe lawyer told me I need to:\n\nGo to Bihar to get bail for my name.\nFile cases in the civil court, DM court, and then the high court to get my car back.\n\nThey also said Zoomcar cannot help me further.\nI hired a lawyer to handle this, but after 9 months, there has been no progress. This situation has taken a massive toll on my mental health. My family, work, and studies are all suffering, and I’m experiencing severe anxiety and depression because of this ordeal.\n\nI feel completely helpless and stuck.

I’ve marked the old wire line with ----. Now, our neighbor also wants to shift the poles to the end of their land along the highway. The last two poles are on our land, forming a straight line perpendicular to the road.\n\nThey are saying it won’t be possible without our cooperation (but I know that even if we don’t shift our pole, which is already on our land away from the highway, the second pole near the highway is in the right place). We can't refuse outright because we live in a village and are expected to cooperate.\n\nThe issue is the total cost. The electricity department has quoted around **₹3.5 lakhs** for the shift. They say we will get an official receipt from the government. Since the poles are on the land of three families (including ours), our share of the cost would be around **₹1.2 lakhs**.\n\nI want to understand the process for this:\n\n1. Can they charge this much?\n2. Is it true that the electricity department installs new poles when shifting old ones?\n\n**Other info:**\n\n* **State**: Uk\n* Why shift - We currently have no problem with the poles being on our land since the area is used for farming. However, some neighbors have built buildings nearby, so they are the ones who want this shift.\n* The poles don’t supply electricity to the village (not sure), but I think they are primarily for factories using high-voltage lines.",

        "selftext": "We are a Muslim family from Maharashtra, and I am sharing my sister’s painful story. She was married in 2020 through an arranged marriage. The groom’s family seemed educated but turned out to be extremely controlling and orthodox. From the very first day, my sister faced mental and physical abuse.\n\nHere’s what she went through:\n\n1. **No Freedom from Day One:** On the first day after her wedding, her in-laws took away her phone and sent it back to us. When she asked her husband, he told her that daughters-in-law in their house are not allowed to have phones and she should use his phone instead. To avoid arguments, my sister gave up her phone and her connection to the outside world.\n2. **Total Control Over Her Life:** Her in-laws controlled everything—what she wore, who she talked to, what she ate, even how and when she laughed.\n3. **No Respect in Her Marriage:** Her husband ignored her completely. He spent most of his time with a girl named \"Gudiya,\" who lived with the family but wasn’t related to them. Shockingly, they even shared my sister’s bed while she was forced to sleep on the floor. He avoided talking to her and came home late at night to avoid any confrontation.\n4. **Her Career Dreams Crushed:** My sister is highly qualified (MA in Geography and B.Ed) and wanted to become a professor. Her husband was also a teacher before their marriage, so we thought he would support her dreams. But after marriage, she found out he had quit his job because his mother told him to. When she tried to prepare for exams like NET/SET, her sister-in-law created drama and stopped her from studying.\n5. **No Healthcare or Basic Dignity:** If she fell sick, she was mocked for being weak. They refused to take her to the doctor unless her condition was serious.\n6. **Gold and Dowry Demands:** Her in-laws constantly praised their elder daughter-in-law for bringing dowry and gold every month. They took all the gold my sister brought with her and kept it in a bank without her consent.\n\nShe silently endured this abuse for two years before finally telling us everything. We immediately filed a domestic violence case against her in-laws and husband.\n\n**Legal Struggles**\n\nSince filing the case, her in-laws have avoided every court hearing by manipulating the police and the system. Over a year has passed, and they haven’t attended a single hearing. Meanwhile, my sister has to go to every hearing, reliving her trauma.\n\nEven when a non-bailable warrant was issued, they managed to escape. Their lawyer even got permission for them to skip court appearances. The judge handling the case seems hesitant to take any action, leaving my sister stuck.\n\nTo make things worse, during this time, her husband secretly married another woman without my sister’s consent. While he lives happily, my sister is left to deal with endless legal battles and mental pain.\n\nWe once thought of settling the matter out of court to get her a divorce, but her in-laws refused. They want to “set an example” for other daughters-in-law, showing what happens if they speak out.\n\n**We are desperate for help.** All we want is for my sister to get a divorce and move on with her life.\n\n**Questions We Need Help With:**\n\n1. How can we speed up the court process and make sure her in-laws and husband are held responsible?\n2. What legal steps can we take to secure a divorce and protect her future?\n3. How do we fight the manipulation of the police and courts by her in-laws?\n4. Can stricter action be taken against her husband for marrying another woman without her consent?\n\nPlease help us. My sister deserves a chance to live her life with dignity and hope.",

I met the ARO, and he said he would do the work after coming for inspection and the remaining 3 offices. Also, I have to pay, so he'll give a new pid number, and I agreed.\" - This is a direct quote.\n\nDecember 2024: We followed up with the seller again, and he replied: \"That also is at standstill as the sakala site is crashed from 2 months - no khatas and no e khata is being made.\" \n\nJanuary 2025: We followed up with the seller, and he asked for the sale deed copy so he could submit the Affidavit for Khata Bifurcation to get individual numbers for the offices on the floor on which our office is located. I confirmed with him today if he submitted and paid the fees in total. He said yes.\n\nBecause of this delay, we are unable to sell the office. In such a situation, does the buyer have a right to cancel the purchase although the property has been registered? Also, two companies refused to rent the office because we didn't have a khata.",

Please feel free to give any info about individual points as well. \n\n1) So A is the only one in possession of the original will and all other survey papers (at least claims to be) and with his he is always encroaching everyone’s property by stating that XYZ have built houses outside the boundaries. \n\nI figure I can get the survey results through a legal process, but the will and other documents, is there a legal process to request him to share all documents that he claims to be the sources with others?\n\n2) A and XYZ agreed to give the said property to a builder for development purposes in 2001. There was some advance money paid out by the builder and there was no development started by the developer in a long time. Since XYZ had no employment, they took out several more advances throughout the years from the said builder, now 20 years later, there is still no development and even though we’re willing to pay the money back (even with interest) the developer isn’t make any progress. \n\nWhat can we do in this situation? \n\nThis has been going on since I was a kid and now I earn quite well and I want to help my dad using some money I can spend. It’s been really hard to see him struggle with his relatives. Any input or suggestions of legal teams are welcome! Thank you for taking the time to read!  ",

        "selftext": "Hi,   \n  \nI want to know certain things. I have been living in rent in a property managed by The Helloworld Coliving in Mumbai. I am facing a fundamental necessity issue, which is drinking water, for which they were supposed to put up a water purifier on the property. They provide water that the property's caretaker refills from another property, and a 20ltr can be used for five people. I have faced multiple issues, such as   \n1. Refilling the water from my friend's place.   \n2. No water available in the middle of the night  \n3. The caretaker not being available to get water, which I have to purchase from Blinkit  \n  \nI had raised multiple complaints with their support team, but they closed the ticket without providing an update or getting a customer response. Their customer service number is provided on the website. I called multiple times, but no one answered the calls. Sometimes, someone responded, but they lack basic essentialnication and accountability. \n\nThe biggest culprit is the property manager; I am sure he has never visited the property. He does most of his work via phone like a mafia boss. Most of the time, he has made false promises and no accountability. Whenever an issue is raised in a call, he gives vague timelines like \"it will be done\". And the biggest irony is that there is only one property manager for the entire location. The support team mainly contacts the property manager to resolve tickets. IItis like a Ponzi scheme where the issue goes completely unheard. I am paying 30k as rent for one single room; I mean, there is a TV, a F#\\*\\*ING TV in the amenities, which is entirely useless but no Water Purifier. The management should be pretty dumb and lame to come up with this.\n\n  \nNow the reason I am facing eviction is I have already mentioned to the support team on email that I will be withholding my rent payment until my issue is fixed which they don't seem to care about as they closed those support tickets which I have raised saying the issue has been fixed but in ground reality nothing's been done. I am clear that when I signed the agreement Water Purifer was part of the amenities that they were supposed to provide. What should I do in this case?",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI need some legal advice regarding a complicated situation.\n\nBackground: I come from a lower-income family. My mother left me immediately when I was born due to psychiatric issues and has lived with her parents for over 25 years. Dad tried applying for divorce, but with no address, no answer or response, he didn't get the divorce. I grew up with my father’s parents, who passed away in 2018.\n\nAfter 15+ years of waiting, My dad (58) found a live-in partner in 2010 who agreed to live without divorce or marriage initially.. She (40) a divorcee with two kids from her first marriage. She didn't tell anything and all lies about her first husband being drunkard and so on. \nThings went downhill quickly with her living in my home— within 1 month my grandparents started losing things, theft, bad behavior, and targeting on property. Whenever dad is at home she acts like an angel with me and grandparents.\n\nGrandparents kicked her out within 1 month and my dad and she have lived separately since 2012 in a rented home.\n\nI am disabled and 90% deaf, and I live in the house my grandparents built in Bangalore. My dad visits daily to help me out with household chores.\n\nIn 2015, dad discovered she had an affair in her first marriage that led to her divorce. Even with dad she had affairs late night talks and dad once caught a guy in home when she was alone. She just brushed it off saying friends. \n\nIn 2017, she had lung cancer, which she made my dad financially supported for operation and recovery.\n\nIn 2018, she had medical treatment to conceive again and ended up having a child without my dad’s decision as well. We don't even know if the kid belongs to dad. She hid this news until the 6th month.\n\nIn 2021, they had a violent fight, leading to police involvement. She took the child and ran to Kerala. She’s using the child to emotionally blackmail dad and has sent legal notices to my address claiming dowry and demanding to live in my home. Despite her issues, people seem to side with her. She tried to barge into my home and dad tried to push her out, leading to my name being included in an FIR.\n\nNow, in 2025, a similar fight happened in their rental home and police were called again.\n\nShe’s sending more legal notices through lawyers in Kerala and demands my dad appear before the Kerala Vanitha Committee on a date. \nThis notice came through my home address and dad unknowingly signed and took the letter, later he was regretting he should not have taken in my home address. \n\nThe latest issue is that she wants to live in my home, as my dad has no income.\nAnd she wants dad to marry her in order to see the child or to be in peace, else she would work on creating issues. \n\nMy dad has a small 1BHK near Electronic City around agricultural land, but she refuses to live there and insists on coming to my home.\n\nShe is also trying to involve me in all this and I suspect she'll again try to enter my home forcefully to live in.\n\nI’m already struggling with my disability unable to work effectively, lost my future, and finances aspects, and now the added legal fees and headache are difficult to pay. \n\nMy home is still in my grandparents' name, and I need to settle a amount as per will with my dad's sister to own it in my name which i am yet to do. \n\nWhat can I legally do to stop her from sending these notices and pulling me into this mess?\nCan i send a return notice to not disturb me and my dad does not stay here in my home? \n\nI don’t want her to stay in my home. Should I send a response to the lawyer stating my dad doesn’t live with me full-time? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nI’m also worried for my dad, who is 58 and having knee issues and worsening health not sure what kind of trouble will he be in. \nHow can i help my dad here. I know he did msny mistakes. But he supports me and understand my issues and try to help me as much as possible. \n\nI have no one to approach or ask for help, no relatives would come in for help unless there is a death. ",

Some rude messages were exchanged and then that person (friend) stopped. \n1. We filed an FIR against all the 4 anonymous Insta accounts. \n1. The police got their real names from Meta company. \n1.

        "selftext": "\n\nI need advice regarding my eligibility for a teaching post and whether I should pursue a court case to claim the position. Here’s my situation:\n\n1. Background:\n\nI applied for a teaching post where the notification mentioned that only candidates with a B.Ed. in Special Education are eligible.\n\nHowever, I knew the qualifications mentioned in the notification were incomplete because, based on past vacancies, candidates with a graduation + special diploma (recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India, RCI) were also eligible.\n\nThe RCI is the only body authorized to decide eligibility criteria for such posts, not the government.\n\n\n\n2. My Qualifications at the Time:\n\nI had a special diploma and was pursuing my graduation. However, my graduation was incomplete at the time of application.\n\nDespite this, I filled out the form, sat for the exam, and scored more than 20 marks above the cutoff (in the 2x result list).\n\n\n\n3. Current Scenario:\n\nI did not attend document verification because I had not completed my graduation by the last date of application, as per the notification’s criteria. , also government was only allowing special bed candidates\n\nMeanwhile, the government sought clarification from the RCI regarding qualifications, and the RCI confirmed that diploma holders (like me) are also valid for the post.\n\nAnd after 6-8 months due to some answers get changed, 2x result was canceled, and a new, fresh result was released today. My roll number is still in this list.\n\n\n\n4. Dilemma:\n\nThe notification clearly stated that all qualifications must be completed by the last date of application, which I did not meet.\n\nHowever, I believe I am eligible for the post based on RCI's clarification and past precedence.\n\nI desperately need this job, and I worked incredibly hard for it.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\nDo I have a strong case if I file a court petition?\n\nWhat legal arguments can I make to strengthen my case?\n\nAre there any past judgments or legal principles that could support my claim?\n\n\nI understand my chances might be slim, but I want to explore all possible options.

        "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI had placed an order with Zara for 8 items worth 21k in Dec 2024. Unfortunately, all the items had some issue or the other in terms of size and fit so I decided to return it. I raised a request to return the items on 30th Dec and my order was picked up by a Delhivery guy on 31st Dec 2024. The person who picked it up was behaving very strangely. As he went through each item to confirm everything was there with all tags intact, he kept asking me the total value of the order and saying \"Ye order toh kaafi mehenga hoga na madam?\" \nI didn't respond and asked him to verify if it was him who was supposed to pick it up. And he said yes and that it was his first day of work so he is new to all this. I verified his phone number from the Delhivery app and then handed him my entire parcel. I later got an email from Delhivery that day that my order was picked up. \n\nOn 3rd Jan 2025, I received and email from Delhivery that my parcel was returned to Zara warehouse. Usually, when we return items to Zara, we get an email from them confirming that they have received it and the refund will be processed. I kept waiting for that email but didn't get one. I contacted Zara's customer service on 10th Jan 2025 and they told me they had only received one sweater in the parcel and it was a non-Zara item so they will not be giving me a refund. I have been chasing them ever since through calls every other day and their executives keep telling me to wait for 24-48 hours as my case has been expedited. But it's going to be month since I returned all the items. \n\nI have my suspicions that the Delhivery pickup guy stole my parcel and handed them random item. But I have not even been able to reach out to Delhivery since they deactivate their AWBs within 15 days. And their automated customer service says to contact the seller. And Zara has been utterly useless in those terms. \n\nI really need my money back. \n\nIs this worth filing a case in consumer court? How can we do it? Or is there any other way I can get them to give my refund. ",

        "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nThanks in advance for reading this huge wall of text :)\n\nA family member of mine booked a wedding hall/banquet situated in Sec 56 Gurgaon on July 7th 2024. They paid 90000 as a booking amount of the total Rs 3,15,000 (Food and Venue only, no decoration.). \n\nThey had booked the pool side venue, however at the time of booking, the pool was operational for members and functions were not being conducted. The Salesperson told us that we can come in November to look at their poolside functions to finalize our decoration.\n\nFast forward to end of November, we had not heard anything from the sales person, and after following up with her multiple times to give us a time to visit the venue for tasting and to see the decoration, she finally gave us a date of Dec 4th. She had informed us that there would be a wedding function in the eve of 4th Dec where we can see sample decoration and taste the food. \n\nWhen on Dec 4th we reached the venue, it was in an ABYSSMAL condition. It looked like they were taking apart the decoration instead of putting it up. Keep in mind that we went there at 8 pm, and the wedding guests had almost started to arrive. \n\nThe entire venue was covered in used straws and disposable spoons/plates, maybe from the day before function and nobody had bothered cleaning it up. The sofa for the bride and groom was dirty and torn and had food/stains marks all over. The low chairs for the bride and groom during pheras, were dirty, and had holes in them. Without getting into more details, it was a very horrible setup.\n\nNow based on all of this, we decided to confront the sales lady (who had been trying to avoid us the entire time btw), and we told them to cancel the venue. \n\nWe had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. With to and fro with the venue management, we were able to get them to send an email to us stating that they will refund \"the amount that we paid at the time of booking\" and that we can expect the refund in 3rd week of January 2025. \n\nHowever, since passing of 3rd week of Jan 2025, they have stopped responding and keep saying that they will send a final date soon. \n\nTldr: A family member booked a poolside wedding venue in Sec 56, Gurgaon, for July 7, 2024, paying ₹90,000 upfront (total ₹3,15,000). The salesperson promised a visit in November to view decorations and food tasting, but after delays, they finally scheduled it for Dec 4. Upon visiting, the venue was in terrible condition—dirty, torn furniture, and no proper setup despite an ongoing event. The family decided to cancel, however they had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. Upon negotiations, the family got an email confirmation of a refund with the venue management. The venue promised a refund by mid-Jan 2025 but has since stopped responding and delayed giving a final refund date. \n\nWhat legal steps can the family take to recover this amount? \n\n",

It’s going to be little long but he actually needs help so please read\n\nHe met a girl in 2019 they fell in love and started living together later he got to know that she was married but she said they got divorced and he trusted her! Then 6 months into the relationship she was after him to get married within 5-10 days as her mother was sick and there won’t be any auspicious day after 30th of some month i don’t remember. He tried to explain her that marriage doesn’t happen quickly and he doesn’t earn enough to be married and he also want big wedding someday! But she kept forcing him by saying I don’t care about big wedding i want small wedding!\nIt was just after lockdown and they got married in Arya samaj.\n\nAfter 1 year of marriage she started behaving controlling like leave your friends stay home with me all the time! Mind that she was 5-6 years older to him, he didn’t want to leave his friends and wanted to drink occasionally  with his friends but whenever he made plans she threatened him by saying i will jump from the building or i will cut my hand!\n\nBefore this threatening happened, my friend bought a house on his name and made his wife the nominee! But later on he could not take all this and he ran off!\n\nIt’s been 3 years since he has left his own home! She took all the stuff from the house which had some very expensive stuff also! She took property papers too which is in her bank locker! \n\nWhen she didn’t respond to mutual divorce! My friend met a girl and have been living with her and wants to marry her so he decided to talk to an advocate! Now he got to know she was married before but never divorced her first husband! Lawyer told him if my friend wants to marry again he can but he needs to forget about his own house any all the stuff including money in joint account with her!\n\nNow finally his wife filled a complaint saying he tortured her basically 498 or something! And she also included his mother and sister in it when he has been living away from family for past 11 years and she met the family twice only that too for lunch or dinner only!\n\nSo he wants to know that she can take away his home and joint account money? Which is his only asset as his family doesn’t talk to him and have nothing else. And as she is not divorced before so can she still claim everything ?",

I contacted them via email regarding the same and I was shocked by their reply. They said and I quote - \n\n\"I'm sorry to hear about the damage to your product. Unfortunately, according to our policy, we do not provide a warranty if the product is damaged or lost due to improper use. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.\"\n\nIt's not even due to outside damage or misuse which they mention in their warranty terms, it's literally the cheap quality of plastic used in the headband. Also if it's not covered under the warranty claim, then why replace them for customers outside of India? This is a well known defect and they've very much acknowledged it in the past as well, I am positively mystified at this remark.\n\nIs there something I can do legally to get them to honor this warranty claim? Seems like they've shut down my ticket too.",

However, I recently received an objection from the Registrar, stating that a part of the name is already registered by someone else in the same class.\n\nA few small law firms have contacted me, offering to assist with drafting and filing a response to the objection for a relatively low fee. They indicated that no hearing would be required since there’s only one cited mark, and they believe the chances of acceptance are good.\n\nIn contrast, I consulted an IP lawyer in my city, who explained that the process involves filing a response, attending 1–3 hearings, and then having the trademark granted by the Registrar, after which it would be open for public scrutiny. His fee for handling the response and hearings is significantly higher—three times the amount quoted by the smaller firms.\n\nTo the IP lawyers in this sub: What is the correct way forward? I’m getting conflicting advice, and I’d appreciate your professional insights.",

        "selftext": "Context:\n\nMy mother is a Physical Education teacher at a government school in Bengaluru.\n\nAfter the Republic Day celebrations, she visited her school in the evening to take down and fold the national flag.\n\n\nWhat Happened:\n\n1. She discovered that massive, decades-old trees on the school campus had been cut down.\n\n\n2. The school headmaster had permission to cut only one dead/dried-out tree and this was done by the concerned authorities by following the procedure few days back\n\n\n3. But yesterday (26/1/25) me and my mom saw that the headmaster has illegally cut two healthy trees without proper authorization (she wasn't present at the sight) and we have a video evidence of the man admitting that the headmaster has payed him to cut.\n\n\n4. The wood from these trees is very valuable and is intended for personal profit.\n\n\n5. As per procedure, tree-felling requires permission from BBMP or the Karnataka Forest Department, who also handle the cutting and removal process. This wasn’t followed.\n\n\n6. My mother recorded videos of the site as evidence and is considering filing a complaint.\n\n\n\nMy Concerns:\n\nIf my mother or I escalate this (e.g., filing a complaint or posting on Twitter), could we face any legal trouble or retaliation from the school/headmaster?\n\nIs there any other legal procedure or body we should approach to address this?\n\n\nKey Questions for Advice:\n\n1. What are the potential legal risks for us if we take this forward?\n\n\n2. What steps should we take to ensure this is handled legally and safely?\n\n\n3. Is there any way to ensure anonymity for my mother while filing the complaint? I'm planning to post this on X(twitter) since benguluru police are active there from what I know ",

The redBus team suggested that I book another ticket on my own while they escalated the issue for a refund, asking me to wait 48 hours for a resolution.

In addition, a couple of days ago, I also received a Property Tax Demand (Rs. 16K or so) from the BMC meaning he hasn't been paying that either. I have been forwarding these to him over WhatsApp.\n\nThe society office is on my side, and are asking me not to pay the rent for the next month (I planned to pay it as per schedule on Feb 5). They say this will put adequate pressure on him to turn up and clear their bill. Should I proceed with not paying?\n\nAlso, I don't want to deal with this headache anyway - can I just take the hit on my security deposit and walk away, no questions asked? The security deposit is worth approx 3 months of rent. The agreement has a clause saying there is a lock-in period of 6 months, but it also states in another part that the landlord is responsible for paying all the bills. \n\nWhat should I do?",

        "selftext": "This post is based on my understanding of the **Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill, 2024**. If there are any mistakes or inaccuracies, please let me know in the comments! I'm happy to learn and discuss. 😊\n\n# Uttarakhand Implements Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in 2024\n\nThe Uttarakhand government has introduced the **Uniform Civil Code (UCC)**, making it the first Indian state to adopt a unified legal framework for all its residents. This law simplifies and regulates matters like **marriage, divorce, inheritance**, and **live-in relationships**, ensuring everyone is treated equally under the same set of laws, regardless of their religion or cultural practices.\n\n# Key Points of the UCC\n\n1. **Marriage Rules:**\n   * Both partners must be **unmarried** at the time of marriage.\n   * Minimum age for marriage: **21 years for men, 18 years for women.**\n   * Marriage between close relatives (prohibited relationships) is not allowed unless permitted by specific customs, and those customs must not go against public policy.\n2. **Polygamy Banned:**\n   * Polygamy is **prohibited for everyone**, including communities where it was previously allowed (e.g., Muslim personal laws).\n   * Only **monogamous marriages** will be legally valid under the UCC.\n3. **Mandatory Marriage Registration:**\n   * Every marriage, even if solemnized outside Uttarakhand, must be registered with the authorities if at least one partner is a resident of the state.\n   * Marriages conducted since **2010** must also be registered retroactively.\n4. **Live-in Relationships:**\n   * Couples in live-in relationships must register their partnership within **30 days** of living together.\n   * **Children born from live-in relationships are considered legitimate** and will have inheritance rights.\n   * Women deserted by live-in partners can claim **financial support (maintenance)** through the courts.\n5. **Equal Inheritance Rights:**\n   * Both sons and daughters are given **equal inheritance rights** to their parents’ property, ensuring gender equality.\n6. **Religious Freedom for Ceremonies:**\n   * Couples can marry following their own religious or customary traditions, such as **Saptapadi, Nikah, Holy Union**, or **Anand Karaj.**\n\n# Who Does It Apply To?\n\n* The UCC applies to **all residents of Uttarakhand**, even those living outside the state.\n* **Scheduled Tribes** and groups with **protected customary practices** under the Constitution are exempt from this Code.\n\n# What Changes Under the UCC?\n\nThe UCC replaces personal laws based on religion with a **common set of rules** for everyone. For example:\n\n* Practices like **polygamy** are no longer allowed.\n* There is now a standardized procedure for marriage, divorce, and property inheritance.\n* Women in both marriages and live-in relationships have clear legal protections.\n\nFINE AND IMPRISONMENT \n\n* Under the Uttarakhand UCC, 2024, failing to submit a live-in relationship statement can result in:\n\nFine: Up to ₹10,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 3 months.\n\nProviding false information or ignoring notices can lead to stricter penalties, including:\n\nFine: Up to ₹25,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 6 months.",

Here’s the situation:\n\n* My father already has a passport, but it expired 5 years ago.\n* He renewed his passport in 2009, and at that time, due to a misunderstanding, his name was recorded incorrectly. Specifically, his grandfather’s name (father's father's name) was included, resulting in a trimmed/abbreviated version of his actual name.\n* Now, his old passport has a name that doesn’t match his Aadhaar card or other documents.\n\nWe recently applied for a passport renewal and visited the Passport Seva Kendra with all the necessary documents for a name correction. However, the officer in charge put the application on hold and insisted that we update the name on his Aadhaar card to match the old passport.\n\nWhile changing the name on the Aadhaar card is possible, it would create a ripple effect, as many other documents (bank accounts, property papers, etc.) are linked to the current name on his Aadhaar. This is the name we prefer to maintain, as it’s consistent across all other documents.\n\nOur goal is to correct the name in the passport to match the Aadhaar card, rather than changing the Aadhaar card to match the old passport. Is there any way to achieve this? Has anyone faced a similar situation or have advice on how to resolve this issue?\n\nAny guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Her father lost her job during covid after which they joined vestige (scam ass foundation). after which the entire family is not looking towards developing skills but to enroll in more and more these kinds of scams. I have proof that she has THOUSANDS (yes im certain) of Aadhaar cards, photographs and stuff which im sure are ILLEGAL .. These Aadhaar cards were used for kyc for these new joiners and she used to send me those to edit (crop tilt etc) since i had a good hand in editing. These ids belonged to ppl from villages and ppl living in slums and u can tell they ain't well off that why enrolling in this scheme . I tried multiple time to make them stop but then the entire family is brainwashed to hell. Is there anything i can do to stop them without coming in picture?.. or is it too late?.. The father is still unemployed. elder child completed their studies and younger child is still studying in clg yet somehow they're still enrolled in this shit\n\nHhttps://www.jaalifestyle.com/\n\nthis is one of the website in which they're enrolled. just by looking u can tell its a scam.\n\ni really want to help them .. cus what they're doing (such as having 1000s of adhaar cards) is damn sure illegal and i don't want them to get into huge trouble for that.",

Eventually, I introduced him to my husband and family, but they didn’t like him.

He says he loves me a lot and is possessive, telling me I shouldn’t talk to anyone else. I tried to fight back, saying I want to continue talking to this person, but then my husband told my family about everything, and things got worse. My mom became physically abusive, and my family started saying awful things to me—things I never imagined they’d say.**\n\n**I feel trapped. My family is now threatening to hurt both me and the person I want to stay in touch with if I leave or continue talking to him. I’m staying with my husband for the sake of my kids, even though I feel completely helpless. The person I wanted to talk to is no longer speaking to me, and my family completely hates both me and him now.**\n\n**I’m terrified to even reach out to him, as my husband is tracking my phone and messages and has been threatening me. I honestly don’t know what to do. All are ignoring me and not letting me leave as well. I feel stuck, scared, and like I have no way out. Does anyone have advice on how to navigate this?**",

It’s in an unsafe condition, with structural instability, burnt debris, and residual oil spills. Despite this, the previous tenant is trying to resume operations there, posing serious risks to public safety.\n\nHere’s what has happened so far:\n\n1. A grievance was filed with the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office, and the issue was forwarded to the District Joint Director (LSGD) and then to the Panchayat.\n\n1. The Panchayat’s investigation report merely stated that “the building is partially ruined” without addressing concerns like structural instability or chemical hazards. No actions have been taken so far.\n\n1. The grievance was closed by the Joint Director's office without verifying if the Panchayat's response addressed the concerns or if any appropriate action was taken.\n\n1. When approached, the Panchayat, the officials said that the Panchayat isn’t responsible for stopping businesses from operating in unsafe premises, but they didn’t clarify which authority is.\n\nI’m not sure what to do next. I’ve contacted multiple authorities, but no action has been taken so far.\n\nMy questions:\n\n* Which authority is responsible for preventing businesses from operating in unsafe buildings in Kerala?\n\n* Should this be escalated to any higher authority?\n\n* Is there any foul play happening? Is that the reason no authority is taking any action?\n\n* How can I ensure that this matter is taken seriously and that action is initiated?\n\nI will attach photos of the burnt building for reference. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!\n\n ",

Since then, I have not gotten my car back. It’s been almost 9 months, and dealing with Zoomcar has been a nightmare.\n\nAfter repeated attempts to get in touch, their lawyer finally called me and informed me that my car has been impounded by the Bihar police. Apparently, the person who rented my car used it to smuggle a huge quantity of alcohol. Since the smuggler wasn’t caught during the incident, they charged me—the car owner—as an accused.\n\nThe lawyer told me I need to:\n\nGo to Bihar to get bail for my name.\nFile cases in the civil court, DM court, and then the high court to get my car back.\n\nThey also said Zoomcar cannot help me further.\nI hired a lawyer to handle this, but after 9 months, there has been no progress. This situation has taken a massive toll on my mental health. My family, work, and studies are all suffering, and I’m experiencing severe anxiety and depression because of this ordeal.\n\nI feel completely helpless and stuck. Has anyone faced a similar issue or can guide me on what to do next? Are there any legal steps I can take against Zoomcar for their negligence or lack of support?\n\nAny advice or suggestions would mean the world to me. Thank you in advance!\n",

I’ve marked the old wire line with ----. Now, our neighbor also wants to shift the poles to the end of their land along the highway. The last two poles are on our land, forming a straight line perpendicular to the road.\n\nThey are saying it won’t be possible without our cooperation (but I know that even if we don’t shift our pole, which is already on our land away from the highway, the second pole near the highway is in the right place). We can't refuse outright because we live in a village and are expected to cooperate.\n\nThe issue is the total cost. The electricity department has quoted around **₹3.5 lakhs** for the shift. They say we will get an official receipt from the government. Since the poles are on the land of three families (including ours), our share of the cost would be around **₹1.2 lakhs**.\n\nI want to understand the process for this:\n\n1. Can they charge this much?\n2. Is it true that the electricity department installs new poles when shifting old ones?\n\n**Other info:**\n\n* **State**: Uk\n* Why shift - We currently have no problem with the poles being on our land since the area is used for farming. However, some neighbors have built buildings nearby, so they are the ones who want this shift.\n* The poles don’t supply electricity to the village (not sure), but I think they are primarily for factories using high-voltage lines.",

        "selftext": "We are a Muslim family from Maharashtra, and I am sharing my sister’s painful story. She was married in 2020 through an arranged marriage. The groom’s family seemed educated but turned out to be extremely controlling and orthodox. From the very first day, my sister faced mental and physical abuse.\n\nHere’s what she went through:\n\n1. **No Freedom from Day One:** On the first day after her wedding, her in-laws took away her phone and sent it back to us. When she asked her husband, he told her that daughters-in-law in their house are not allowed to have phones and she should use his phone instead. To avoid arguments, my sister gave up her phone and her connection to the outside world.\n2. **Total Control Over Her Life:** Her in-laws controlled everything—what she wore, who she talked to, what she ate, even how and when she laughed.\n3. **No Respect in Her Marriage:** Her husband ignored her completely. He spent most of his time with a girl named \"Gudiya,\" who lived with the family but wasn’t related to them. Shockingly, they even shared my sister’s bed while she was forced to sleep on the floor. He avoided talking to her and came home late at night to avoid any confrontation.\n4. **Her Career Dreams Crushed:** My sister is highly qualified (MA in Geography and B.Ed) and wanted to become a professor. Her husband was also a teacher before their marriage, so we thought he would support her dreams. But after marriage, she found out he had quit his job because his mother told him to. When she tried to prepare for exams like NET/SET, her sister-in-law created drama and stopped her from studying.\n5. **No Healthcare or Basic Dignity:** If she fell sick, she was mocked for being weak. They refused to take her to the doctor unless her condition was serious.\n6. **Gold and Dowry Demands:** Her in-laws constantly praised their elder daughter-in-law for bringing dowry and gold every month. They took all the gold my sister brought with her and kept it in a bank without her consent.\n\nShe silently endured this abuse for two years before finally telling us everything. We immediately filed a domestic violence case against her in-laws and husband.\n\n**Legal Struggles**\n\nSince filing the case, her in-laws have avoided every court hearing by manipulating the police and the system. Over a year has passed, and they haven’t attended a single hearing. Meanwhile, my sister has to go to every hearing, reliving her trauma.\n\nEven when a non-bailable warrant was issued, they managed to escape. Their lawyer even got permission for them to skip court appearances. The judge handling the case seems hesitant to take any action, leaving my sister stuck.\n\nTo make things worse, during this time, her husband secretly married another woman without my sister’s consent. While he lives happily, my sister is left to deal with endless legal battles and mental pain.\n\nWe once thought of settling the matter out of court to get her a divorce, but her in-laws refused. They want to “set an example” for other daughters-in-law, showing what happens if they speak out.\n\n**We are desperate for help.** All we want is for my sister to get a divorce and move on with her life.\n\n**Questions We Need Help With:**\n\n1. How can we speed up the court process and make sure her in-laws and husband are held responsible?\n2. What legal steps can we take to secure a divorce and protect her future?\n3. How do we fight the manipulation of the police and courts by her in-laws?\n4. Can stricter action be taken against her husband for marrying another woman without her consent?\n\nPlease help us. My sister deserves a chance to live her life with dignity and hope.",

I confirmed with him today if he submitted and paid the fees in total. He said yes.\n\nBecause of this delay, we are unable to sell the office. In such a situation, does the buyer have a right to cancel the purchase although the property has been registered? Also, two companies refused to rent the office because we didn't have a khata.",

There was some advance money paid out by the builder and there was no development started by the developer in a long time. Since XYZ had no employment, they took out several more advances throughout the years from the said builder, now 20 years later, there is still no development and even though we’re willing to pay the money back (even with interest) the developer isn’t make any progress. \n\nWhat can we do in this situation? \n\nThis has been going on since I was a kid and now I earn quite well and I want to help my dad using some money I can spend.

        "selftext": "Hi,   \n  \nI want to know certain things. I have been living in rent in a property managed by The Helloworld Coliving in Mumbai. I am facing a fundamental necessity issue, which is drinking water, for which they were supposed to put up a water purifier on the property. They provide water that the property's caretaker refills from another property, and a 20ltr can be used for five people. I have faced multiple issues, such as   \n1. Refilling the water from my friend's place.   \n2. No water available in the middle of the night  \n3. The caretaker not being available to get water, which I have to purchase from Blinkit  \n  \nI had raised multiple complaints with their support team, but they closed the ticket without providing an update or getting a customer response. Their customer service number is provided on the website. I called multiple times, but no one answered the calls. Sometimes, someone responded, but they lack basic essentialnication and accountability. \n\nThe biggest culprit is the property manager; I am sure he has never visited the property. He does most of his work via phone like a mafia boss. Most of the time, he has made false promises and no accountability. Whenever an issue is raised in a call, he gives vague timelines like \"it will be done\". And the biggest irony is that there is only one property manager for the entire location. The support team mainly contacts the property manager to resolve tickets. IItis like a Ponzi scheme where the issue goes completely unheard. I am paying 30k as rent for one single room; I mean, there is a TV, a F#\\*\\*ING TV in the amenities, which is entirely useless but no Water Purifier. The management should be pretty dumb and lame to come up with this.\n\n  \nNow the reason I am facing eviction is I have already mentioned to the support team on email that I will be withholding my rent payment until my issue is fixed which they don't seem to care about as they closed those support tickets which I have raised saying the issue has been fixed but in ground reality nothing's been done. I am clear that when I signed the agreement Water Purifer was part of the amenities that they were supposed to provide. What should I do in this case?",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI need some legal advice regarding a complicated situation.\n\nBackground: I come from a lower-income family. My mother left me immediately when I was born due to psychiatric issues and has lived with her parents for over 25 years. Dad tried applying for divorce, but with no address, no answer or response, he didn't get the divorce. I grew up with my father’s parents, who passed away in 2018.\n\nAfter 15+ years of waiting, My dad (58) found a live-in partner in 2010 who agreed to live without divorce or marriage initially.. She (40) a divorcee with two kids from her first marriage. She didn't tell anything and all lies about her first husband being drunkard and so on. \nThings went downhill quickly with her living in my home— within 1 month my grandparents started losing things, theft, bad behavior, and targeting on property. Whenever dad is at home she acts like an angel with me and grandparents.\n\nGrandparents kicked her out within 1 month and my dad and she have lived separately since 2012 in a rented home.\n\nI am disabled and 90% deaf, and I live in the house my grandparents built in Bangalore. My dad visits daily to help me out with household chores.\n\nIn 2015, dad discovered she had an affair in her first marriage that led to her divorce. Even with dad she had affairs late night talks and dad once caught a guy in home when she was alone. She just brushed it off saying friends. \n\nIn 2017, she had lung cancer, which she made my dad financially supported for operation and recovery.\n\nIn 2018, she had medical treatment to conceive again and ended up having a child without my dad’s decision as well. We don't even know if the kid belongs to dad. She hid this news until the 6th month.\n\nIn 2021, they had a violent fight, leading to police involvement. She took the child and ran to Kerala. She’s using the child to emotionally blackmail dad and has sent legal notices to my address claiming dowry and demanding to live in my home. Despite her issues, people seem to side with her. She tried to barge into my home and dad tried to push her out, leading to my name being included in an FIR.\n\nNow, in 2025, a similar fight happened in their rental home and police were called again.\n\nShe’s sending more legal notices through lawyers in Kerala and demands my dad appear before the Kerala Vanitha Committee on a date. \nThis notice came through my home address and dad unknowingly signed and took the letter, later he was regretting he should not have taken in my home address. \n\nThe latest issue is that she wants to live in my home, as my dad has no income.\nAnd she wants dad to marry her in order to see the child or to be in peace, else she would work on creating issues. \n\nMy dad has a small 1BHK near Electronic City around agricultural land, but she refuses to live there and insists on coming to my home.\n\nShe is also trying to involve me in all this and I suspect she'll again try to enter my home forcefully to live in.\n\nI’m already struggling with my disability unable to work effectively, lost my future, and finances aspects, and now the added legal fees and headache are difficult to pay. \n\nMy home is still in my grandparents' name, and I need to settle a amount as per will with my dad's sister to own it in my name which i am yet to do. \n\nWhat can I legally do to stop her from sending these notices and pulling me into this mess?\nCan i send a return notice to not disturb me and my dad does not stay here in my home? \n\nI don’t want her to stay in my home. Should I send a response to the lawyer stating my dad doesn’t live with me full-time? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nI’m also worried for my dad, who is 58 and having knee issues and worsening health not sure what kind of trouble will he be in. \nHow can i help my dad here. I know he did msny mistakes. But he supports me and understand my issues and try to help me as much as possible. \n\nI have no one to approach or ask for help, no relatives would come in for help unless there is a death. ",

Around the same time, my sister's old friend who had a new Instagram account also messaged her. We didn't know it was a friend. We thought it was one of the miscreants. Some rude messages were exchanged and then that person (friend) stopped. \n1. We filed an FIR against all the 4 anonymous Insta accounts. \n1. The police got their real names from Meta company. \n1. We also managed to get the names of the account owners from the cops. 2 people who had a quarrel with my sister and 1 old friend (that's how we came to know about the friend's new account). \n1. The friend also got a call from the police and then called us to explain. \n\nSo now, we have a situation where we named an friendly innocent person (along with the real culprits)  in the FIR. \n\nHow can we resolve the situation with minimum trouble to our friend? We don't want the friend to go through the pain of the legal process. ",

Is there a way to force the company to payup, all they said was operational difficulties and i have it on record. from my understanding i think they couldn't get a lot of people on the plane to make it worth the cost of service, but that's not my problem.I think this is a unique case as i spoke to some of the staff and they said not many people had any other flights from flying plans from aizawl",

        "selftext": "\n\nI need advice regarding my eligibility for a teaching post and whether I should pursue a court case to claim the position. Here’s my situation:\n\n1. Background:\n\nI applied for a teaching post where the notification mentioned that only candidates with a B.Ed. in Special Education are eligible.\n\nHowever, I knew the qualifications mentioned in the notification were incomplete because, based on past vacancies, candidates with a graduation + special diploma (recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India, RCI) were also eligible.\n\nThe RCI is the only body authorized to decide eligibility criteria for such posts, not the government.\n\n\n\n2. My Qualifications at the Time:\n\nI had a special diploma and was pursuing my graduation. However, my graduation was incomplete at the time of application.\n\nDespite this, I filled out the form, sat for the exam, and scored more than 20 marks above the cutoff (in the 2x result list).\n\n\n\n3. Current Scenario:\n\nI did not attend document verification because I had not completed my graduation by the last date of application, as per the notification’s criteria. , also government was only allowing special bed candidates\n\nMeanwhile, the government sought clarification from the RCI regarding qualifications, and the RCI confirmed that diploma holders (like me) are also valid for the post.\n\nAnd after 6-8 months due to some answers get changed, 2x result was canceled, and a new, fresh result was released today. My roll number is still in this list.\n\n\n\n4. Dilemma:\n\nThe notification clearly stated that all qualifications must be completed by the last date of application, which I did not meet.\n\nHowever, I believe I am eligible for the post based on RCI's clarification and past precedence.\n\nI desperately need this job, and I worked incredibly hard for it.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\nDo I have a strong case if I file a court petition?\n\nWhat legal arguments can I make to strengthen my case?\n\nAre there any past judgments or legal principles that could support my claim?\n\n\nI understand my chances might be slim, but I want to explore all possible options. Your guidance would mean a lot to me.\n\nThank you!\n\n.\n\n",

Unfortunately, all the items had some issue or the other in terms of size and fit so I decided to return it. I raised a request to return the items on 30th Dec and my order was picked up by a Delhivery guy on 31st Dec 2024. The person who picked it up was behaving very strangely. As he went through each item to confirm everything was there with all tags intact, he kept asking me the total value of the order and saying \"Ye order toh kaafi mehenga hoga na madam?\" \nI didn't respond and asked him to verify if it was him who was supposed to pick it up. And he said yes and that it was his first day of work so he is new to all this. I verified his phone number from the Delhivery app and then handed him my entire parcel. I later got an email from Delhivery that day that my order was picked up. \n\nOn 3rd Jan 2025, I received and email from Delhivery that my parcel was returned to Zara warehouse. Usually, when we return items to Zara, we get an email from them confirming that they have received it and the refund will be processed. I kept waiting for that email but didn't get one. I contacted Zara's customer service on 10th Jan 2025 and they told me they had only received one sweater in the parcel and it was a non-Zara item so they will not be giving me a refund. I have been chasing them ever since through calls every other day and their executives keep telling me to wait for 24-48 hours as my case has been expedited. But it's going to be month since I returned all the items. \n\nI have my suspicions that the Delhivery pickup guy stole my parcel and handed them random item. But I have not even been able to reach out to Delhivery since they deactivate their AWBs within 15 days. And their automated customer service says to contact the seller. And Zara has been utterly useless in those terms. \n\nI really need my money back. \n\nIs this worth filing a case in consumer court? How can we do it? Or is there any other way I can get them to give my refund. ",

        "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nThanks in advance for reading this huge wall of text :)\n\nA family member of mine booked a wedding hall/banquet situated in Sec 56 Gurgaon on July 7th 2024. They paid 90000 as a booking amount of the total Rs 3,15,000 (Food and Venue only, no decoration.). \n\nThey had booked the pool side venue, however at the time of booking, the pool was operational for members and functions were not being conducted. The Salesperson told us that we can come in November to look at their poolside functions to finalize our decoration.\n\nFast forward to end of November, we had not heard anything from the sales person, and after following up with her multiple times to give us a time to visit the venue for tasting and to see the decoration, she finally gave us a date of Dec 4th. She had informed us that there would be a wedding function in the eve of 4th Dec where we can see sample decoration and taste the food. \n\nWhen on Dec 4th we reached the venue, it was in an ABYSSMAL condition. It looked like they were taking apart the decoration instead of putting it up. Keep in mind that we went there at 8 pm, and the wedding guests had almost started to arrive. \n\nThe entire venue was covered in used straws and disposable spoons/plates, maybe from the day before function and nobody had bothered cleaning it up. The sofa for the bride and groom was dirty and torn and had food/stains marks all over. The low chairs for the bride and groom during pheras, were dirty, and had holes in them. Without getting into more details, it was a very horrible setup.\n\nNow based on all of this, we decided to confront the sales lady (who had been trying to avoid us the entire time btw), and we told them to cancel the venue. \n\nWe had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. With to and fro with the venue management, we were able to get them to send an email to us stating that they will refund \"the amount that we paid at the time of booking\" and that we can expect the refund in 3rd week of January 2025. \n\nHowever, since passing of 3rd week of Jan 2025, they have stopped responding and keep saying that they will send a final date soon. \n\nTldr: A family member booked a poolside wedding venue in Sec 56, Gurgaon, for July 7, 2024, paying ₹90,000 upfront (total ₹3,15,000). The salesperson promised a visit in November to view decorations and food tasting, but after delays, they finally scheduled it for Dec 4. Upon visiting, the venue was in terrible condition—dirty, torn furniture, and no proper setup despite an ongoing event. The family decided to cancel, however they had also signed a contract with the venue, where they had mentioned that that all deposits are non refundable, unless mutually agreed. Upon negotiations, the family got an email confirmation of a refund with the venue management. The venue promised a refund by mid-Jan 2025 but has since stopped responding and delayed giving a final refund date. \n\nWhat legal steps can the family take to recover this amount? \n\n",

It’s going to be little long but he actually needs help so please read\n\nHe met a girl in 2019 they fell in love and started living together later he got to know that she was married but she said they got divorced and he trusted her! Then 6 months into the relationship she was after him to get married within 5-10 days as her mother was sick and there won’t be any auspicious day after 30th of some month i don’t remember. He tried to explain her that marriage doesn’t happen quickly and he doesn’t earn enough to be married and he also want big wedding someday! But she kept forcing him by saying I don’t care about big wedding i want small wedding!\nIt was just after lockdown and they got married in Arya samaj.\n\nAfter 1 year of marriage she started behaving controlling like leave your friends stay home with me all the time! Mind that she was 5-6 years older to him, he didn’t want to leave his friends and wanted to drink occasionally  with his friends but whenever he made plans she threatened him by saying i will jump from the building or i will cut my hand!\n\nBefore this threatening happened, my friend bought a house on his name and made his wife the nominee! But later on he could not take all this and he ran off!\n\nIt’s been 3 years since he has left his own home! She took all the stuff from the house which had some very expensive stuff also! She took property papers too which is in her bank locker! \n\nWhen she didn’t respond to mutual divorce! My friend met a girl and have been living with her and wants to marry her so he decided to talk to an advocate! Now he got to know she was married before but never divorced her first husband! Lawyer told him if my friend wants to marry again he can but he needs to forget about his own house any all the stuff including money in joint account with her!\n\nNow finally his wife filled a complaint saying he tortured her basically 498 or something! And she also included his mother and sister in it when he has been living away from family for past 11 years and she met the family twice only that too for lunch or dinner only!\n\nSo he wants to know that she can take away his home and joint account money? Which is his only asset as his family doesn’t talk to him and have nothing else. And as she is not divorced before so can she still claim everything ?",

If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.\"\n\nIt's not even due to outside damage or misuse which they mention in their warranty terms, it's literally the cheap quality of plastic used in the headband. Also if it's not covered under the warranty claim, then why replace them for customers outside of India? This is a well known defect and they've very much acknowledged it in the past as well, I am positively mystified at this remark.\n\nIs there something I can do legally to get them to honor this warranty claim?

The interest was way too high and they someone paid them off with the help of my cousin brother who took loan to finish the loan.\n\nThis happened in 2021.

They obliged and paid some more amount.\n\nThis time they took a signature on paper that everything is paid off. 3 people have signed it as witness.\n\nFrom what I know the people who loaned the money do not have any legal permission to loan money to anyone.

However, I recently received an objection from the Registrar, stating that a part of the name is already registered by someone else in the same class.\n\nA few small law firms have contacted me, offering to assist with drafting and filing a response to the objection for a relatively low fee. They indicated that no hearing would be required since there’s only one cited mark, and they believe the chances of acceptance are good.\n\nIn contrast, I consulted an IP lawyer in my city, who explained that the process involves filing a response, attending 1–3 hearings, and then having the trademark granted by the Registrar, after which it would be open for public scrutiny. His fee for handling the response and hearings is significantly higher—three times the amount quoted by the smaller firms.\n\nTo the IP lawyers in this sub: What is the correct way forward?

        "selftext": "Context:\n\nMy mother is a Physical Education teacher at a government school in Bengaluru.\n\nAfter the Republic Day celebrations, she visited her school in the evening to take down and fold the national flag.\n\n\nWhat Happened:\n\n1. She discovered that massive, decades-old trees on the school campus had been cut down.\n\n\n2. The school headmaster had permission to cut only one dead/dried-out tree and this was done by the concerned authorities by following the procedure few days back\n\n\n3. But yesterday (26/1/25) me and my mom saw that the headmaster has illegally cut two healthy trees without proper authorization (she wasn't present at the sight) and we have a video evidence of the man admitting that the headmaster has payed him to cut.\n\n\n4. The wood from these trees is very valuable and is intended for personal profit.\n\n\n5. As per procedure, tree-felling requires permission from BBMP or the Karnataka Forest Department, who also handle the cutting and removal process. This wasn’t followed.\n\n\n6. My mother recorded videos of the site as evidence and is considering filing a complaint.\n\n\n\nMy Concerns:\n\nIf my mother or I escalate this (e.g., filing a complaint or posting on Twitter), could we face any legal trouble or retaliation from the school/headmaster?\n\nIs there any other legal procedure or body we should approach to address this?\n\n\nKey Questions for Advice:\n\n1. What are the potential legal risks for us if we take this forward?\n\n\n2. What steps should we take to ensure this is handled legally and safely?\n\n\n3. Is there any way to ensure anonymity for my mother while filing the complaint? I'm planning to post this on X(twitter) since benguluru police are active there from what I know ",
