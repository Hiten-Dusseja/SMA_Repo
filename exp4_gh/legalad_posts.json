I was that husband who had to see the intimate pics of his wife with a guy on her phone.\n\n When reprimanded she and her family accused me of her infedility and filed domestic abuse suite against me. To physically hurt someone is beyond death to me, a case was filed against my poor mother as well.\n\nI had a fairly good practice profesionally and this incident derailed me. I was an oncosurgeon with a leading hospital but this destroyed my career and reputation I moved away from my expertise into the basics as the court and her lawyer never spared me. I became reliant on alcohol at one point of my life. \n\nI lost my life in front of me on this pursuit.A day, a lady cop took me and mother in their van to the police station.i can never forget that day in my life...Thinking of that gets me into tears everyday of my life. \n\nThere was a time were I broke down in the court while the milord smirked at my plight. I have always played by the rules in my life and my honesty was of no value.\nThe judge made sarcastic comments in the hearing.\n Nobody even heard me, even the court..my eye are just flowing while I write this and no man should ever go through this.\n\nI was at the brink of death but I couldn't do it. I recovered from it. I don't know how I'm able to live today but I'm existing \n\nI'm not good with words when I'm emotional \n",

The individual in question comes from a wealthy background, which seems to grant him immunity from facing murder charges. I'm truly stunned by the lack of murder charges against him. Both the judge overseeing this case and the lawyer defending the accused, who has taken the lives of two individuals, appear deeply rotten and they lack a moral compass. What steps can we take to rectify this injustice and reclaim this case?   \nIt's unacceptable that wealth can serve as a ticket to evade the consequences of murder.",

        "text": "My friend and I visited Goa from January 11th to 14th and stayed at a place called Hotel Vibes Inn in Nagoa, next to the church. Initially, everything seemed fine. The caretaker, a man named Saleh Ahmed, was polite, and we even offered him food during our stay.\n\nOn January 14th, the day of our checkout, we left the room at 11 AM but kept our luggage at the hotel since our bus back was at 9 PM. The hotel has a common washroom on the ground floor connected to the caretaker's quarters. Before heading out to explore Mapusa, I went to the washroom to change.\n\nLater, my friend went to use the same washroom, and that’s when everything went wrong. She came out crying, visibly shaken, and told me Saleh Ahmed had been peeping at her through the washroom window. I was furious and immediately called the Anjuna Police Station.\n\nThe police arrived quickly and took Saleh Ahmed into custody. Shockingly, the hotel owner tried to bribe us to withdraw the FIR. All the washroom windows in the hotel were connected to a passage, making it easy for someone to spy.\n\nThis incident happened yesterday (January 14th) at around 7:15 PM. I’ve been trying to get a copy of the FIR, but the police keep telling me that the server is down. Can someone guide me on how to escalate this or ensure I get the FIR?\n\nMy friend is traumatized by the incident, and it’s heartbreaking to see her go through this. I feel responsible for choosing this hotel, which turned what should have been a relaxing vacation into a nightmare.\n\nI’m sharing this to warn others: Do not book rooms at Hotel Vibes Inn in Nagoa, Goa. You never know who might be watching.\n\nWe’re pursuing this case legally because no one should have to experience this violation of privacy and trust. Please stay safe, and if anyone has advice on how to handle the delay in obtaining the FIR, I’d greatly appreciate your help.\n\nEdit 1: Thank you so much, everyone, for the support. I’ve received the FIR copy.",

One night when we both were drinking, she got very angry and fought about why i asked her to pay half in our wedding. We split all expenses in our wedding equally. Suddenly she was on top of me and started slapping me for 4- 5 times. I was utterly shocked. I didn’t know what to do so i went in washroom for sometime. She also broke glass. This is 8 months old incident. Since then she has been fighting over very small issues and i am ignoring as breaking marriage is not easy thing to do. She has embarrassed me in front of my friends too. I am very sad that I’m living with same woman with no fault of mine. Somehow she also manages to put all blames on me and now I’m confused if it is is my fault. Is it healthy to stay in this relationship? It is also affecting my work, I’m sole earner in my family and she doesn’t seem to care at all about financials and peace at home. Please advise. I’m also very much worried what happens if we decides to separate knowing indian laws. Can someone guide me what are my options legally ?",

        "text": "I’m feeling extremely stressed and helpless right now, so I really need you to hear me out. Recently, I had to return my office laptop because it was my last day at the company. They forced me to hand it over immediately, and since the termination was so sudden and unexpected, I didn’t have time to log out of my personal Gmail. My personal Gmail was linked to some office-related newsletters, but I didn’t think much of it at the time because I assumed they would reset the laptop.\n\nYesterday, the IT person from the company contacted me, advising me to log out of my personal Gmail. I explained to him that the termination was rushed, and I simply hadn’t had the chance, but there was nothing suspicious in my emails anyway. However, during the conversation, he confessed that he had accessed my GOOGLE PHOTOS linked to that account—going through 10 years of my personal photos under the pretence of “company policy.”\n\nHe claimed to have found some private photos, including ones I wasn’t even aware were saved there. He said he SAVED THEM, stating he “had a great time” going through my pictures. He even sent me some of the photos as proof and went on to make inappropriate advances, telling me he’d liked me from the beginning and that now, after seeing my photos, he wanted to “taste me.” He made further comments about us having “great chemistry.”\n\nI was terrified and didn’t know how to respond. Out of fear, I told him I’d meet him in person to discuss this, though I have no intention of doing so. When I asked him politely to delete the photos, he said he would but implied he was doing me a favor and expected something in return. He was persistent about meeting in person, drinking, and doing things I am absolutely uncomfortable with. He also said that if someone else had accessed the photos, they wouldn’t have kept them to themselves, implying that I owed him for his “discretion.”\n\nI feel so violated and unsure of what to do. My friends have told me I shouldn’t have agreed to meet him, and I realize now how unsafe that would be. I never thought something like this could happen. The company is a small startup with no HR or POSH policies, and I don’t trust anyone there to help me. I’m terrified he might use these photos to blackmail me, and I don’t believe he will delete them as he claims. I’m also scared that pursuing legal action might provoke him to distribute the photos, which I desperately want to avoid.\n\nI do have recordings of our conversation because my phone automatically records calls from unsaved numbers. This situation has left me shaken, and I just can’t stop thinking about it. I need advice on what to do next.",

One of my close friends has the same problem and asked me what I did so I told him and asked him specifically to use half a tray of ice and not to use chilling water. That idiot used 2 trays of ice and now he can't see from his left eye. His father called me 30 minutes ago and told me that he's gonna sue the fuck out of me. He didn't ask for money or anything and only threatened me with legal action for the loss of vision caused to his son due to my advice. I told my parents immediately and they have my back 100%. I have call recordings of me expressly telling my friend not to use too much ice otherwise it can hurt your face and his father threatening me. We have a great family lawyer but he is not available till next sunday. Please I don't care if you're a lawyer or not just any advice on this will be greatly appreciated.\n\nEDIT- after much effort I gathered the guts to call the father again and he said the loss of vision is temporary and he has been prescribed eye drops. The vision is back but its still blurry and they have to check in with the doctor after a week. He asked me not to contact his son again and ended the call. I might post the call recording of his father shouting at me on r/TotalKalesh just for fun after this whole issue settles down. Thanks for all your support and advice.",

Many of you comment on my last post to beat him up, so did i, i also called my sister to slap him 2 3 times. After that i called 112, and a pcr van came to our house, relatively quickly (mere 15 mins). He was taken to police station and booked under POSCO and 354D. His offenses ( as per my lawyer) are mental harrasment, stalking, sexualizing a minor and sexual harrasment of a minor. He will be spending the time in jail till the court decides his total jailtime. According to my lawyer, he'll be doing atleast 5 years of jailtime with some fines too.\n\nHis family spent atleast 2 hours arguing, pleading and crying in front of me to let him go. He, on the other hand, was acting tryhard in station, till he came to know that stalking is a literal crime. That wiped the 'cool' smirk of his face.",

My friends noticed that he was always very conscious of what people talked about him. When we had a few fights he forbid me from telling anyone about it. Now that he has “gotten” me, he has lost all interest. He doesn’t come home from work until 2 AM, talking about it always ends up in a big fight. He gets very defensive, and today he ended up hitting me. My face is all red and swollen. \nHe perhaps did it in the heat of the moment without intending to hit so badly but he refuses to apologise or even acknowledge it. He says I always cry for smallest things. He even convinced me not to visit a therapist saying do not go down that hole. \nPlease help on what should I do. Am I overreacting?  \nEdit: There is no financial trouble, both of us have a well paying job. ",

        "text": "I never thought I’d have to write something like this, but here we are. I need advice and support, and most importantly, I want to raise awareness about **food-based discrimination in schools**.\n\n# What Happened?\n\nMy **5-year-old son**, who attends **Global Indian International School (GIIS) in Ahmedabad**, was **forced to sit in a corner alone** during lunch because he had a **boiled egg in his tiffin/lunchbox**.\n\nHis class teacher told him that **his food was “unhealthy”**, while the rest of the class—**all vegetarian children** (claimed by the teacher)—sat together and ate. This **wasn't an accident**. It has happened before, but this time, our son finally spoke up because **he couldn’t take it anymore**.\n\nImagine a young child, excited for lunch, only to be **isolated and shamed for something as simple as eating an egg.**\n\n# The Bigger Issue – Psychological Impact on My Son\n\n* **He now thinks eating eggs is bad.** He came home and asked us, *“Papa, why do I eat unhealthy food?”*\n* **Other kids have started bullying him.** Since the teacher segregated him, classmates have started seeing him as “different.”\n* **He felt punished for something completely normal.** At five years old, he is **questioning himself, his food, and even our parenting.**\n\nThis is **not just about my child**—this kind of **subtle discrimination** can create **deep psychological scars** in kids at such a young age.\n\n# Our Complaint to the School – The Director’s Shocking Response\n\nWe officially complained to the school and met with the **director**—expecting them to listen, apologize, and correct this unacceptable behavior. Instead, we were met with **aggression and dismissal.**\n\n* The **school has NO official policy banning eggs or non-vegetarian food.**\n* The **school director admitted** that there’s no complaint from other parents about our son eating eggs.\n* But then, **he doubled down**, saying *\"If you continue sending eggs, your son will continue to sit alone.\"*\n* His **excuse?** *“Be sensitive! If parents find out that their vegetarian kids are eating next to a child with eggs, they will oppose the school.”*\n* He himself is **a non-vegetarian (a Christian), yet he was enforcing this “rule” to avoid controversy.**\n\nThis **hypocrisy is infuriating**! If the school truly wanted to **protect \"sensitive\" children**, then:\n\n* Why **aren't Jain kids forced to sit alone** when others eat onions or garlic?\n* Why **aren't lactose-intolerant kids separated** when others drink milk?\n* Why **aren't gluten-free kids sitting in a corner** when wheat is served?\n\n# Food Segregation in Schools – A Dangerous Trend?\n\nThis is **not about vegetarian vs. non-vegetarian**. I **fully respect** vegetarianism and religious food preferences. However, **forcing a child to sit alone** because of his lunch creates **a culture of exclusion** that is dangerous for young minds.\n\nInterestingly, **some schools in Tamil Nadu serve eggs in mid-day meals** to ensure children get proper nutrition. If government schools can accept eggs, why is a so-called “international” school in Ahmedabad discriminating against it?\n\n# What We Are Doing Next\n\n1. **We have filed an official complaint** with the **CBSE Board** and the **Gujarat Education Department** via the PG Portal.\n2. **We will take this issue to social media** to create awareness about food-based discrimination in schools.\n3. **We are considering legal action**, as this is **a clear violation of a child’s rights** under the Right to Education (RTE) Act.\n\n# How Can You Help?\n\n* **Have you faced similar issues in Indian schools?** Please share your experiences.\n* **How should we push back legally?** Any lawyers or activists willing to guide us?\n* **Should we take this to the media?** Would this help create enough noise to hold the school accountable?\n\nWe are a **truly international family**—my wife is **American/Cuban**, and we have **always embraced diversity**. We never judge what others eat or believe in. But what happened to our son is **not okay**.\n\nNo child should be **isolated and humiliated** for eating something that is **not banned and is completely normal in millions of Indian households.**\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts. How should we proceed? 🤝",

        "text": "I’m honestly at a loss here and could really use some advice.\n\nSo, my friend and I were staying in the same PG. We were really close—he even told his parents I was his best friend. Since he was a minor, I helped him out with almost everything—studies, daily stuff, you name it. After Diwali, he texted me saying he’d broken up with his girlfriend, and when he got back to the PG, he seemed really down and depressed.\n\nMy friends and I noticed how low he was, so we did everything we could to lift his spirits. We took him out to eat, went on walks, just tried to keep him company and cheer him up. Then, a few days later, he attempted suicide. He’s okay now, thankfully, but here’s where things took a turn.\n\nApparently, he told his parents that I was the one who pushed him into it, that I pressured him to do it. Last night, I got a call from his parents accusing me of driving him to suicide. I immediately called his brother to explain the situation, and his brother reassured me that it would be fine, that he’d handle it.\n\nBut this morning, his parents showed up at our PG, and without giving me a chance to explain anything, they started yelling at me and then they actually hit me (I got beaten pretty bad). They wouldn’t listen to a word I said.\n\nI don’t want my parents involved in this because I don’t want to worry them. But I can’t understand why he would say this about me. The entire PG knows we were close, and he was with me the day before he tried to take his life.\n\nAny advice on how to handle this?",

You disrespect our 'Ram', we'll beat you up.\n\nAll of this while recording my brother and his friends.\n\nNow, that Youtuber has upload a Short on his channel and he has portrayed my brother as some guy who is disrespecting Ram.

My initial thought was to go find the YouTuber and break a limb on him but I want to tackle this legally.\n\nPlease suggest me what I can do or not do.\n\nAlso, please feel free to ask any questions.",

        "text": "\n\nI (17M)am really sad rn and my heart is sinking so fast from the past few weeks,so my mom talks to a aunty on phone frequently and she puts on earphone everytime and locks the door to talk with her and even while chatting she keeps her phone entirely tilted. I was surprised but didn't mind much, my sister (11) however tried to see what was happening. The chats used to get deleted every 12 hours or so and the WhatsApp being used had a password that my sis and me cracked down. A few weeks into the investigation my sister said it's a guy and his English is very bad, like he writes WhatsApp as whotsup. I only know the name of his wife let suppose Pooja, but there are like 10 poojas ik that mom knows. After some time mom would go out with him and we catched up but we thought it's still a girl with bad English, once moms phone rang and it was him but with a girl's name as I said before. I asked mom and she said it's some girl from her college days . But, my sister still sneaked in om the chats and disaster struck as we saw the chats of all the cheating and intimate stuff. Worse shit is he asks mom to send all the chats she had with everyone in a day and she sends it and also recording of our camera it's really creepy and scary.My mom acts so normal you can't even think she would do that. I loved her so much. She did a lot of hard work when my dad was down financially for some time.\n\nAlso I am preparing for entrance exams and will go to college this or next year and idk what to do my sister will be home alone and I can't do shit about it\n\nShould I tell my dad or wait and also we have pets, and a house and some lannd and things I am not aware of please help me this has been burdening me and I cant perform in exams due to this, I also have an exam in 4 days with 4 more exams left after that, and if I have to take a drop idk what I will do. \n\nMy dad works a job and mom does some stuff too but not job. \n\nIf I tell my dad everything will be over and idk how he will react too, to make the matters worse what if that guy blackmails or something as he has a wife too.\n\nPLEASE HELP ME, I also have a sister and she cries everyday while I can just hug her pleaseee help",

        "text": "In 2021, a distraught mother approached my office, seeking help for her daughter, let us call her Sara, who had been brutally assaulted by a trusted family friend.\n\nI remember listening to her carefully as she recounted her harrowing experience, her voice trembling with fear and pain. I ensured that Sara received the necessary medical and psychological support before delving into the legal proceedings.\n\nLike every SA case, there were numerous challenges, including societal stigma surrounding sexual assault. However, I  remained steadfast in my commitment to Sara's cause, advocating for her rights in and out of the courtroom.\n\nWe got a court monitored investigation order which made the case strong from the beginning and resulted into meticulous investigation. At the time of cross-examination the defense's attempts to discredit Sarah's testimony failed miserably. As they say Truth alone triumphs. Sara stood confidently and answered all the questions(some of them being inappropriate too) of the defence.\n\nI believe knowing that she was not alone in her fight for justice made her bravely  face the legal proceedings. \n\nYesterday, the Judgement was pronounced which made my and Sara's dedication and perseverance pay off as the perpetrator was found guilty and sentenced for 20 years imprisonment. \n\nSuch type of judgements keep the flame of Justice burning. Sara finally found closure and the opportunity to begin her healing journey, empowered by unwavering advocacy and support of her family.\n\nMy takeaway is that legal battles take time but a Solid lawyer and an unwavering client with truth can get you justice.You can comment your takeaways from the above incident.

Please refer to the original post for detailed background and comments: [https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceIndia/comments/1ghvoor/made\\_1l\\_transaction\\_to\\_wrong\\_upi\\_id\\_because\\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceIndia/comments/1ghvoor/made_1l_transaction_to_wrong_upi_id_because_of/)\n\n**tl;dr:** HSBC followed the protocols, but I believe their support staff is subpar. They mislead you, causing unnecessary delays. SBI didn’t act until RBI intervened—they ignored HSBC’s request for a recall of funds and denied it, citing the unavailability of the beneficiary.\n\nAfter registering my complaint with the RBI Ombudsman in early November, the resolution process began. Here’s the sequence of events:\n\n* RBI contacted HSBC regarding the allegations and asked them to present their case through a virtual conference (VC), which included me and the RBI team. This occurred in late November.\n* RBI concluded that HSBC followed the protocol to recover the money and was not responsible for the remitter’s negligence.\n* They further instructed HSBC to check the transaction logs for the two transactions made one second apart (as I claimed not to have made the second transaction). Additionally, they requested HSBC to present the initial call recording where I was allegedly assured the money would be returned within 48 hours. I haven’t received any updates on this yet.\n* RBI instructed their team to follow up with SBI and expedite the process.\n\nAfter Christmas, I started receiving calls from various SBI branches. They verified some details and informed me that the beneficiary’s account had a zero balance, and retrieving the money would take time. They also mentioned that the beneficiary withdrew the funds on the same day I made the transaction.\n\nIn late December, the beneficiary contacted me, stating that he had received my money incorrectly and wanted to return it. He requested me to write an email to his SBI branch to unblock his accounts so he could send the money via UPI. I instead asked him to return the funds through the recall of funds, that I raised earlier, by providing his consent. Later I consulted RBI, and they confirmed that receiving the money via UPI was acceptable.\n\nI am unsure how many of his accounts were blocked, as the account to which I transferred the money had a zero balance. The beneficiary also stated that he was unable to withdraw his salary.\n\nThe next day, he visited his bank, and the branch manager informed me that his account had been unblocked temporarily. The manager assured me that the beneficiary would transfer the money via UPI in the bank’s presence and provide proof to the bank. I agreed to this arrangement.\n\nEventually, the beneficiary transferred the amount (INR 100.00 short).\n\nFinally, I received my money, and I wrote an email acknowledging the resolution to all parties involved.",

I have had fine experience with both male and female docs before wrt this earlier.\n\nWhere as with some male docs, there have been instances of blatant disregard for consent, privacy when it involved examination of intimate parts. Infact, it wasn't even a proper examination of the spot where tumour is located, so to say. Yet another male doc made sexual jokes (referring to me without naming me obviously) with the male nurses in the room while I lay in a vulnerable condition under local anaesthesia for a certain medical procedure.\n\nBasically, I am quite clear that whatever has happened amounts to violation of patient's dignity and modesty. What I want to know is if registering my grievance with the hospital medical superintendent automatically means escalation to legal processes.\n\nI don't have bandwidth for legal processes now. For a while, I thought I might just suck it up because I have numerous phases of my treatment left to be completed with different doctors. But then I can't continue to dread appointments with newer male docs because oncology tends to be a male dominated field. It's difficult for me to find onco's who are reputed for good outcomes and are female as well. \n\n\nPlease let me know.\n\nThanks\n\nP.S.: If you can't be kind and respectful, please refrain from responding to this post.\n\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your kind words, support and encouragement.

They said if that's the case then I should not approach the police and we got into an argument, the ngo lady then said this is what is going to happen here , we are not from any metrocity that I expected things to go smoothly and if I want to get my boyfriend arrested I should listen and do whatever the police wants , even if it means listen to their comments and tolerate their lewd looks. I said that's not a sane opinion. \n\nWhile all this was happening my landlord kept calling me to pay the rent , which I had given it to my boyfriend ( now ex) to pay him , I asked the landlord to call my ex and take it for him as it's with him and I'm busy with work, the landlord called me a while later saying my ex abused him and told him not to call that he has nothing to do with the rent , for obvious reasons the landlord was pissed and told me to pay the rent in two days or to vacate because he isn't here to hear abuses .\nMy ex isn't receiving my calls either and I got to know that he has already lawyered up.\nI unfortunately do not have money to lawyer up nor pay my rent.\n\nI have decided to let this go , as much as I understand how important it is to stand up against such things, I simply do not have the resources to do so especially the law and police system being so shitty in my city.\nI ended up shaming him on social media so the women  in my city atleast are safe from him.\nI am extremely sorry if I have let y'all down but I did try my best but it's just not possible given my current state \n\nThis is going to be my final update about this topic.",

I had been called dependant, loser, insecure, impotent and what not. She almost filed for divorce during our separation. But later returned to our place (I belive it's because she could not get along with her family). Within a month of her return, the same old shit show started. Me and my family had been accommodating of her behaviour (for a year) because her father had a heart attack, followed by colon cancer and was undergoing treatment. \n\nToday, after a heated argument she slapped me and is now blaming me for provoking her. \n\nI'm fucking done. I believe she overstepped the line.  Please suggest a course of action.\n\nEdit: \nShe is refusing to file divorce and also refusing to leave my home.

She has no proof etc. Yet my guy is in jail. \n\nNow how to deal with this.\n\n\nUpdate: Had got a call from the station for a statement. After my statement, I asked the police how is he doing and they told me that he has been shifted to Mumbai Central jail and the women police cop is telling me to be careful while your hanging around with women or dating them. \n\nA little information about the notice he received. I don’t know much but what the cop said me is - she has written it caused her mental breakdown etc etc and has demanded 3 crores. (Poor guys family net worth is not that much). All I know is they dated for 3 months and were also intimate on both ends and she was at his place always when they were intimate. Now my brain starts to think if a guy wants to rape why would he take the women to his residential address? If it’s a rape their should be lot of resist hurt marks etc as well! Which is doubt not.\n\nMy 2 cents to men who is into dating. - never date a women who is coming from a broken family. They ll dump all their trauma to you and then you start feeling bad for the women and start helping her out and later when u try to break up they ll trap u and blackmail you. \n\n(Women from broken families don’t have anyone to stop them or guide them to the right path, they have nothing to loose and can go any extent to fuck your life up) \n\nAll this started because my colleague broke up with her stating the reason he ll be moving out of the country for masters and long distance relationship will not work out. He decided to break up right away because he saw that the relationship is going more towards seriousness within 40 50 days of knowing each other and he felt it’s not right. \n\nBut while in the relationship he did everything to her to make her feel great. Taking her out on dates, movies, beaches, hotels and talked to her all night while he had to come the next morning. He used to say that he had 2 hours of sleep last night because he could not cut the damn phone call because she did not let him hang up. While this is a small glimpse I hope all men know that how much we do for a women to feel better and after all this u end up in central jail for breaking up with a genuine reason. \n\nNEVER DATE A WOMEN WITH BROKEN PARENTS AND NEVER SHOW COURTESY TOWARDS THEIR PAST. WOMEN WHO HAS NOTHING TO LOOSE NO ONE TO STOP CAN GO ANY HEIGHTS TO FUCK U UP BECAUSE THIS INDIAN LAW IS ONLY MADE FOR WOMEN.\n\nI am in no contact with him since his arrest. I just hope his dad can take care of him. I feel to cry placing myself in his shoes thinking about career falling apart.\nWhat is the use of living anymore when everything is shattered to pieces and all you can do is move step closer towards suicide. \n\nHe was always telling about doing something in the energy/hydrogen engineering space.

Both of their families also knew each other and marriage was about to fix. They have had physical relationships as well.\n2months back the girl gets a job in a tech company and started building relationship with one of her colleagues 24M. She started ignoring my friend, blocked from everywhere.\nMy friend sensed something is going on and spoke with the girls brother 19M. Then her brother shared a video recording of chats of Instagram of her sister (Her sister's laptop was with him and she was logged in to Instagram in her laptop). After knowing this my friend broke up with her and when the discussions are going on the other bf came and he told everything. My friend has helped her financially and mentally since last 3 years and tried for suicide as well. But now he is well and kept his distant from girl.\nBoth the families spoke and my friends side clearly told that they can't get their son married because she cheated. Her parents requested for forgiveness which my friend's family didn't accept.\n2days back the girls mother sent a message to my friends mother ( a suicide note). In that the girl had clearly mentioned that she did the mistake and now she found out the 2nd bf was in a live-in relationship with another girl and he was just playing with her. So she attempted for suicide. After knowing this my friend sent one of close friend to the girls hostel, who took her to the hospital. The girl has taken 30 tablets. By the time the girls family came, she was well taken care of and all bills are paid. ( the girls family is very poor and didn't even have money to pay the hospital bill or hostel charges) my friend took care of everything \n\nNow the girls family is trying to blackmail my friend to marry their daughter ( on the pretext of marraige he kept physical relationship). They are threatening if my friend does not marry then they will file a rape case on my friend and send him to the jail. \n\nMy friends is now totally frustrated and is telling it's better to die than go the jail.\n\nNote: in suicide note , she mentioned good things about my friend and how he helped and how his love was true for her. Also mentioned about the other bf how he played with her.\nI am sure if the other bf would have been there then would have not tried to suicide or family would not have blackmailed. They just want to remove the burden from their head by doing this. My friend father is a rich person and he does not want to talk with the girls family. As he has a huge respect and never bowed his head. So he is telling if my son did wrong then let him go to jail I will fight in court but I will never speak with the girls family or compromise.\n\nNow I need suggestions for this case. How my friend can come out of this. And if the girl goes to the police station do police directly register the case or ask any questions before registering the FIR",

I recently had a case that deeply affected me, involving a young man falsely accused of rape.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nMy client, let's call him Sahil, was a bright and promising college student. He had a clean record and a reputation for being a respectful and responsible young man among his classmates. However, his life was turned upside down when a classmate accused him of sexual assault.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI initially thought that the boy was lying but he had whatsapp chats and recordings which showed that the case was false. The girl played on the past consensual relationship she had with the boy and had an FIR registered against the boy.\r  \n\r  \nAs happens in most of the cases, Sahil's reputation was tarnished, and he faced the very real possibility of spending years in prison for a crime he didn't commit. Being a close witness to such cases, I can say that the emotional toll it took on him and his family was immeasurable. His friend circle was broken, he was left all alone. Even the parents were ashamed of the boy and thrashed him badly.\r  \n\r  \nWe gathered some more documentary evidence through Court and successfully got an anticipatory bail for the boy and I hope the trial and the pain ends soon providing justice to Sahil.\r  \n\r  \nAs I reflect on this case, I am reminded of the importance of due process and the presumption of innocence. False accusations of rape not only have the potential to destroy the lives of the accused but also undermine the credibility of genuine victims.  \n\n\nOriginally posted on r/JusticeforIndianMen",

        "text": "I am from Maharashtra and I had an arranged marriage a few months ago. My wife is very simple, which is something I wanted because I am the same. On our first night together, we had sex, and she seemed quite experienced, which made me suspect she might not be a virgin (though I have no issue with her virginity or any past relationships). The next day, I asked if she had ever had a boyfriend. She started crying and said she had never been involved in that way. I felt bad for asking and decided to move on. I even told her I was okay with her having guy friends and that I trusted her completely.\n\nHowever, about a month later, I noticed she was frequently chatting with someone and became very protective of her phone. She seemed scared if I tried to touch it. I once saw a message from her friend that seemed suspicious, but I can't remember the exact details. She also started deleting old messages and now uses auto-delete on WhatsApp. I decided to ignore it, thinking I needed more concrete evidence.\n\nFew days ago, I saw a message on Instagram from another guy. She told him she didn't like living in my home and felt like a maid. The guy insulted me lightly in Hindi, and she didn't defend me, which hurt a lot because I have always supported her. I wanted to take a screenshot but couldn’t because she was right there. Next day, I checked her Instagram again, but all the messages were deleted. However, he had sent her some reels: one was a comedy about a girl talking to her boyfriend even after marriage, and the second was a romantic, intimate hug.\n\nAfter that, I decided to spy on her mobile. I logged into her Instagram account on my phone by using the forgot password option. While keeping an eye on her Instagram chats, I saw her message him asking for a video call. After the call, she told him she missed and loved him, and he replied the same. I took snapshots of all those messages. She somehow found out I was spying on her Instagram and realized her account was also logged in on my phone, so she changed her password. Now she knows I’m spying on her and probably suspects I know everything.\n\nI am trying to stay calm and not let her know that I am aware of her actions. I can’t confront her directly right now because we live alone in the city while our parents are in our hometown. If I confront her, she might harm herself, which I am concerned about. I don’t know what to do.\n\nI am thinking of divorce, but it will impact everyone, including my family, who are part of our society. I need help figuring out how to confront her. I might be willing to give her another chance, but I am not sure if she will be loyal in the future. She is very clever and lies convincingly, making it hard for me to catch her. I also want to teach her a lesson at least.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nUpdate: I have confronted her, and she admitted that she still has a relationship with her boyfriend and has had multiple physical encounters with him. I packed her bag and took her to her family. There might be a meeting today to discuss everything. I am still not sure what to do. She is a very fake person, but I am scared of divorce and the court system.\n\nNote: I received a lot of messages over the past few days. I am really sorry I didn't reply. I am going through a lot and not using my phone that much.\n\n",

My aunt is planning to entangle me up with his son somehow and get me married to him so they get the property. What's the best course of action I can take , ig I don't do anything either I will be sent to my aunts place or will be dead.\n\nEdit : thanks for all your advice and suggestions and sorry for not responding ( i was dealing with health issues and was shifting to another relatives place who was close to my Nani and better than rest of my family in terms of trusting her with my life ).

At this moment all I can do his soothe my mom's ego and give a false hope while preparing the funds to leave. Once again thanks for all your inputs and definitely all your suggestions has helped to get at this decision. I'm not planning sell this house untile all my other options are out of picture , this is the last memory i have of her",

A couple of months back, I hooked up w this dude I met at a party, he was a senior (idk him personally) while we were at it, and all of a sudden a saw his phone flash turn on and I had tried to stop him from recording, he didn't I started to cry etc and he said he had deleted the video, I hung out w him a bit sneakily checked his phone couldn't find my video and I never spoke to him again until he started to bother all my friends esp male friends. However, weeks later I heard rumours of a sex tape on me and a bit later his own girlfriend came and told me that he's been showing that video to people. I initially thought she's lying,  probably was in denial that this was happening. Now a little while back, he did show that video ON FULL VOLUME to an entire group of people at a tea stall in front of me and I couldn't do shit. This is starting to get to me, esp because people already call me a slut coz I used to hook up etc and this guy has connections with some very dangerous people near our college and everyone is very scared of him. \nThe only proof I have is the video (because in the video you can hear me crying and telling him to stop recording) and I have a voice recording of his girlfriend telling me. Any advice? My college would not care and instead blame it on me.\n\nEdit: This was the only place, where I thought I could find a solution to this, (apart from going to the cops). Also, I never used this account much apart from what so many people pointed out on my profile. I no way advocated a certain way of lifestyle, I know I made mistakes and put myself in that situation, but isn't that how people end up asking legal advice, I mean you won't find people asking how to get a DL here.\nAlso, all of these things came up months after we hooked up. \nTo the people pointing out that I brought myself into this, would you say that to your homie if he got falsely accused of rape? I can't and don't have the energy to sit and argue and read all those comments but a lot of people like you aren't wondering whatabouts of the guy.",

Unfortunately, I was unable to meet him before he passed away. I was devastated, overwhelmed with grief, and heartbroken that I couldn’t say my final goodbyes.\n\nAfter the cremation ceremony, my father’s phone rang. When I answered it, it was a credit card collection agent, informing me of a debt of ₹3.5 lakhs that no one in the family knew about. Soon after, I received another call from a person who said my father had borrowed ₹1 lakh from him and never returned it, and now I was expected to pay it back.\n\nTrying to process all of this, I told my mother. She reassured me that she had savings of around ₹3 lakhs in her bank account, but when we checked, we discovered that my father had withdrawn all the money. To add to our shock, we realized her jewelry was also missing. Calls kept pouring in from various people, informing us about my father’s debts. They provided call recordings and bank statements, proving these transactions. It was all too much to take in.\n\nWe thought at least we had our home, which we could sell to settle some of the debt. But the biggest blow came when we found out he had sold our house three months ago and was living off the rent without telling anyone.\n\nI tried to trace these transactions, but everything appeared as cash withdrawals from ATMs. When I spoke to his friends, I learned that he had been deeply addicted to alcohol and gambling—specifically, stock market F&O and Teen Patti.\n\nI knew he drank, but I had no idea it was to this extent.\n\nIn just one week, I went from grieving the loss of my father to hating him. He deserves to rot in hell for what he has put us through.",

The passage is very small and he stands there shirtless and blocks my way, if I ask him to give way he screams and says build your own stairs.  He always shouts, tries to physically intimidate me and supress me every time. He has always stood there shirtless and gives very less space for me to walk and every time I have passed next to him, he has touched me inappropriately and sexually harassing me multiple times.    We went through this torture for more than 2 years and we couldn't take it anymore so we decided to move away from that place. When  I tried to question him openly, he threatened to cut our cable, internet and electric wires, because they pass in front of his home. I have taken photos of him blocking the entire way and sitting  shirtless in the passage way.\n\n \n\nAfter a week of moving to new place I went to Govindrajnagar police station to file a complaint against him but the police are not ready to take my complaint.\n\n\n\nFirst they asked me to come another time and when I reached there they had called this person and said please adjust and resolve it yourself. First of all they wanted me to 'adjust' with this person who had been molesting me for 2 years. I said no and wanted to move forward with the complaint. Then they said come back next week to meet the SP. I came back and then the constable had called the molester as well. He said sorry and that he won't do it again and to not give the complaint. I said I still wanted to move forward with the complaint. Then the guy suddenly said , okay then I'll also give a complaint saying you molested my wife. The constable said , if he gives a complaint then I'll have to confiscate your visa, you will lose your job and you'll have to go to jail unnecessarily, so please take the complaint back\n\n\n\nI have no clue what to do now. Can anyone please help. I know they have absolutely no case. But the police just joined hands with this person. \n\n\n\nAnd everytime I go to the station this person is already there.

I don't want him to do the same to other people. \n\n\n\nCan anyone help me with my next steps legally or otherwise?

        "text": "30 M India here. My wife has had a history of long distance affairs. We have been married for 2 years, no kids, and before our marriage and for almost a year after our marriage, she was texting and calling her ex boyfriend romantically, and lying to me that he was just a friend now. She blocked him twice after our arguments, and then third time, I told her mom and she blocked him for good. I have chat screen recordings from her phone of most of her chats, in which they also discussed having a child together. I have some call recordings as well, where we fought, and she even suggested me to get a girlfriend too.\nThen quite recently, in July last year actually, she started going to a Zumba class. Since a few months, she was chatting quite a lot with her instructor, but she would hush me saying he's just a good friend whenever I asked about it.\nA few days ago, I discovered they are having a full on affair, they might have even got physical, not sure at the moment. I have chat screenshots where they talk about their relationship and having an affair.\n\nNow, I want to divorce her. I have no greed for her jewellery or anything financial she has, she can have it all. In fact, I have been paying her 10k monthly for almost a year now, but I don't want that back either, or the new iPhone that she bought with that money. I just want her gone, even if I have to pay one time alimony or any decent settlement. \n\nI love her family to be honest, and I did not disclose it to anybody because I did not want to put them through this. I will also always take care of her parents and her brother like they are my own, because I love them. \n\nIn terms of my financial obligations, I earn around 1.5 lacs per month, I have a plot under my name with a house being constructed on it, there's a loan as well on both of them. I have around 3-5 lacs in savings like Mutual Fund, PPF and Pension Fund.\n\nPlease advise me how to proceed.\n\nEdit #1 : Thank you so much everyone for all the support and care. I have been bottling it for weeks now, and it was poisoning me. I can't express in words how much it means to me!!\n\nEdit #2 : Someone asked if there were any red flags I noticed earlier, in case there was anything to learn. Yes there were, and nothing would make me happier than the fact that my misfortune could be someone's treasure. I have posted in a comment, but I am posting again for everyone.\n\nSign 1 : She refused to let go of her ex boyfriend even after our marriage was fixed, kept talking about how much she loved him, kept chatting with him. Kept crying about how much it hurt her when she found out that he has been dating other girls online as well.\n\nSign 2 : She outright asked me to break the marriage arrangement whenever we had a fight. She apologized later but doesn't matter.\n\nSign 3 : She was desparate for attention, she wanted me to talk to her 2-3 hours a day continuously, even my work and office did not matter to her. It is still the same.\n\nSign 4 : She kept asking me to promise her I will never cheat on her, time and again, as if she was projecting her flaw on me.\n\nSign 5 : She was extremely jealous of me even looking at another woman, even if they were work colleagues, or mentors or anyone else. She would immediately jump to the conclusion that I am cheating on her with them.\n\nSign 6 : She kept threatening me that she will one day disappear or do something to herself. One night she said she was going to leave her house alone forever, I believed her at the time, and begged her not to leave, worrying what would happen to her family.\n\nSign 7 : She has a friend who is married and still keeps in touch with her ex without her husband's knowledge. My wife has often tried to justify her behaviour in the name of love.",

        "text": "My father (65M) was hit by a bike while crossing the road. He sustained severe injuries on his brain and after a week in ICU, he finally passed away. The passers by, on the day of accident, had nabbed the driver and taken pictures of him and bike. We have identified the driver (name).\n\nWe have lodged an FIR with the police but there was no mention of the bike driver in the FIR. The particular section in the report was left as ‘unknown’ despite the police themselves nabbing that guy at the time of the accident. Only the bike number is mentioned in the report. Not sure if this was intentional by the police and whether they may have been bribed to leave out the name.\n\nThe total hospital bill came upwards of 7L compounded with the traumatic loss of my father. We have talked to a few lawyers who have assured that we may get justice (in form of compensation). However, I have read from a few Reddit posts of similar situations where the lawyer themselves were bribed to turn the case. Now I am not sure if we would be served justice and don’t know if anyone can be trusted at all. Wanted to check how probable it is to win justice in such cases (accidents resulting in death)?\n\nP.S.- I do not care about the compensation since the greatest loss we are bearing (loss of life) cannot be compensated now. However, there should be some accountability for this accident which had landed our family in such a terrible situation.\n\nLocation of the accident was Noida",

After 10 days time the police caught and brought them back to the police station. At that time the girl gave the statement that she ran away with her consent and there was no mistake of the boy(my brother) The police took both their signatures on that statement and sent them both to their respective parents home. We tried to take a photo or Xerox of that statement but the police said it is not allowed to do so. Now after 15 days of giving that statement that girl has filled a rape case against my brother including kidnapping, intimidation. As the girls family is wealthy I am suspecting police are also cooperating with them. Could you guys please suggest some good courses of action. Thank you.",

        "title": "Girl I met through my uncle for Arranged Marriage threatening to file a case after refusal to marry (Karnataka)",
        "text": "I (29M, from Udupi Karnataka & working in USA) met this girl (25F, from Udupi Karnataka) via an arranged marriage setup from my uncle last month. She was matching all my preferences and we had been talking for over 6 months. It was almost too good to be true. I was happy and we were moving in the right direction so upon being asked I told her I would be willing to look at the possibility of marriage. Since the beginning she had maintained a traditional posture and only had girls as her friends. She wasn't very educated but I had no issues since she was willing to relocate with me to USA. Last month I found out that she isn't as simple as she seemed. I came to India to meet her and we met twice. Due to pure luck,, I found out that she had been attending some classes to \"trap a rich US based guy\". \n\nAlong with my younger sister I tried to find out the truth about these covert classes. She roped in a friend and I paid for a few classes. They taught everything from \"cleaning up social media\" to maintaining a \"traditional image\" in front of guys. To my utter shock there were girls as young as 19-20 yrs old attending those classes while biking away with their boyfriends after the so called \"image cleaning\" classes. Anyway, the girl I was seeing seemed to have followed the instructions to the dot and now I wasn't even sure who the hell was I courting. Strangely enough, despite being so \"naive\" and a \"crybaby\" she actually had the smartness to dig up a very hidden conference video of mine given by me a long time back representing my older company. She knew everything about me that was available online. Almost seemed like someone else had dug it up for her as part of bg check or something. So this dummy friend that we had sent to the \"marriage classes\" told us how the girls are taught to hide stuff about their medical conditions, past, family history of mental illnesses and even the fact that they have/had \"guy-friends\". Personally I have no issues with any of these factors & I m only looking for a genuine person. Most girls attending those classes seemed to have come from broken families n it's quite common in my culture for people to have bad/abusive marriages so I had no issue with that but it made me mad how they used this fact to leverage their life. \n\nThe girl I was seeing seemed to have no qualms in setting abroad with me leaving her mother alone in India despite being an only child. But my egoistic mind at the time allowed me to believe she was smitten by me only to later on come to know that I was just a \"prey\" who fell for this bullshit too easy. \n\nBy now I was convinced after giving a good number of days on this investigation that everything about the girl was fake. Even though our extended families knew each other since decades, no one was aware of her true self. Once a long time back on a VC I had noticed a very small moisturizer bottle kept in the background that belonged to a famous five star hotel chain that my company is tied up with. I had asked if she had ever been there and she dismissed saying it was just something she got from a friend. At that time I obviously didn't pay much attention as it was a small thing. Now something just ticked me and luckily I have a very close school friend working for that hotel chain who I asked to simply check if there is an identity of her in their database. Yes, I am aware that's not right and he didn't retrieve any data for me but did inform that her ID existed in their database. He didn't tell me her booking details (not sure if he didn't have access or didn't want to risk). I know what I did was horribly wrong but I was desperate to find out. I asked her in different ways if she had been to Bangalore for probably a wedding or some event or anything at all but she refused having been to Bangalore anytime in the last one decade. I confronted her about attending those \"marriage classes\" and she outright denied saying those were just \"cooking classes so she could prepare my favorite dishes\" LOL. I discovered that her mother was a schizophrenic (this was hidden from me) but she still claimed that she had told me. \n\nFinally, I told her that I was not interested in marrying her and hell broke loose.\n\nNote: I SWEAR I had NO physical relationship with her of ANY kind. She threatened to file a case of fraud and refusal to marry on me and my family.  She spread lies in her side of the family saying I tried to forcefully kiss her and get physical when we had first met in person. This is not true at all. I wish we had met at a proper hotel where there were CCTV cameras to prove the same but we rather met on a beachside so there is no proof of my innocence. Yesterday, a family relative of hers, a police inspector marched into my house and confiscated my passport threatening to put me in jail. \nNow, a number of our mutual relatives are whispering that I am this perverted guy who only is trapping simple girls from their hometown. I will get my passport back today but I can't leave the country as I am worried for what they will do to my family and besides they have threatened to lodge FIR. \n\nWhat should I do guys??\n\nOFF-TOPIC- I was in a relationship some years back with a beautiful kind girl for 2 years but we broke up because she wanted marriage and I was willing to marry only someone from my home state.  Something tells me this is Karma for me as she was there for me always and breaking her heart probably made me face this situation today. I at least was lucky enough to have been loved by her and having known her well I know she had all the qualities. \n\nThe current experience has left me scared to death about Arranged Marriages. What should I do guys?? Any good recommendations for lawyers here??\n\nUPDATE: Thankfully, I got my passport back after a lot of trouble today. The girl's cop relative handed over the passport to her and pretended like he never forcefully took it. I have received a lot of help on this portal. Will update more as and when things progress guys and respond to queries.",

        "text": "I have been married since past 3 years. It was an arranged marriage. Me and my spouse are living in a rented accommodation for now. I don't mind paying the rent and the house is decent.\n\nMy wife and in-laws have started pressurising me to purchase a property. Their opinion is that property is a must and they want it for the security of future generation. \n\nI tried explaining why I wasn't interested in buying the property right away and have decided to purchase it two years later. This resulted in a big marital discord and we temporarily separated for a couple of months. We finally reached an agreement after keeping both the families in loop that I would purchase a property after 1 year from now. \n\nWe started staying together about a month ago and my wife said she won't bring this topic until one year. However, within one week, she started throwing tantrums and started asking me when I am going to purchase a property. \n\nI have repeatedly told her that I need at least a year to purchase a property. But, she never listened to me and is very adamant on the demand. Lately, she told me that she won't have any physical contact with me until I buy a property. \n\nI have tried explaining her how I am trying to create multiple sources of income for our future but it has gone in vain. I am a bit unclear on whether denying physical intimacy in exchange of property is the right thing to do to any person. \n\nFrom the beginning of marriage, we have been staying separately from my parents. However, now she says she wants to stay in my parent's house as that is her matrimonial house. Also, she doesn't share good relationship with my mother and I advised her not to visit my parent's place since she creates a huge ruckus wherever she goes. She threatened me that she will call the police and tell them that my parents are not allowing her to enter her matrimonial house.\n\nHer behaviour caused lot of emotional pain to me initially. But in the past one month, I have been very mindful of the way she is gaslighting me and avoided any long explanations. Instead, I just give one-liner replies and reply either yes, no or I don't know. This has protected my mental health and I feel slightly better now.\n\nI wanted some advice on how should i take the relationship forward and how can I safeguard my parents (forget me) legally in such matter. I know that laws are heavily biased towards women and I don't have any hopes from the judiciary as well. Even if I record the conversation, they will throw me behind the bars for breaching someone else's privacy. Is there a ray of hope here ?",

        "text": "My family met a girl through the arranged marriage process for my brother. We met her only twice—once when my parents met her and her family, and the second time when my brother and I were present as well. However, my brother didn’t like her and decided to reject the proposal.  \n\nThere was almost a month-long gap between these two meetings due to unforeseen events. During this time, my brother and the girl spoke on the phone maybe twice and exchanged only a few text messages. He was never interested in the proposal, but since my parents liked her, they wanted him to meet her once, which he did.  \n\nThe girl’s family was informed about a week ago that we would not be proceeding with the proposal. As soon as they received the news, the girl and her father started calling us repeatedly. The girl wanted my brother to reconsider because she had become \"attached\" to him and wanted to marry him. However, my brother firmly told her that it wouldn’t be the right decision and that they couldn't move forward. It took her some time to accept the rejection, but eventually, she did.\n\nThe issue now is with her father. He hasn’t stopped calling my dad since they got the news. My dad doesn’t answer because he felt bad rejecting a \"nice\" family, but at the same time, he knows there’s no point in discussing it further, as my brother’s decision is final.  \n\nToday, we found out that the girl’s father had already informed the people in his \"community\" that his daughter was going to get married. Apparently, in their community, once a girl is introduced to a potential match, it means the arrangement is final. He also mentioned that his daughter has refused to consider any other matches and has threatened to commit suicide if she doesn’t marry my brother?? Wtf\n\nI just want to know if they can file any legal case against us. Thank you ",

I looked into her case file and while talking to her I asked her and found out:\n\n1. She was married at 12 years of age or before that\n\n\n2. She has no age verification document (meaning she could be below 18)\n {for the note: everyone getting admitted in hospital mostly has age Verifying govt document} I suspect that she doesn't have age verifying document because she isn't actually 18, but her husband faked her age to avoid legal liabilities. \n(Because she had a child at 13 but her kid is apparently 3 years old, which doesn't make any sense cuz she's 18) \n\n\n3. Her husband is 20 years older than her or more ( at least that's what she said, but when I saw her husband he appeared to be in his 50s) \n\n4.

Her husband doesn't allow her to work in handicrafts or continue her education in any way fearing she'll \"fall in love with someone else and run away\".\n\n7.Additionally the main reason why she was not allowed to leave hospital was because, She's suicidal and has uncountable scars from SH. \n\n\nHow can I help her? \n(The incharge can't help her, because apparently \"we gwt people like them every now and then but we can't possibly help them all\" And its not worth it) \n\nEDIT: \nI'LL LIKE TO ADD A FEW ADDITIONAL INFO\n\n1. She's from a muslim community. \n\n2. Her husband might actually come tomorrow if I report to police, and if he gets the chance, he'll actually kill her. \n\n3. Her family doesn't give an f about her. \n\n4. Her husband had previously had fights with her and choked her (she has scars around her neck, which she claims are from falling down the stairs) \n\n5.

Now in our family none of us had any idea/clue about this dual personality of his, all i know is through the chats i saw on his phone, he doesn't know we know about it yet. In july he met this girl online who told him how she made a fortune by trading in forex markets. She somehow convinced him to invest and that she'll become his mentor and make him rich. My grandfather lost about 12 lakhs to a scam call in 2022 and has been guilty ever since so he thought he'll recover that money. She sent her a site which i know is totally fake and He intially deposited 40K inr and traded with it, the money was deposited in random accounts in which a fake customer care of that site asked him to deposit, they asked for investments in different accounts everytime. Within the next 15 days he invested almost 3.5 Lakhs. She used to flirt with him and convinced him of doing all this🤡. He withdrew $51(4080 inr) and thought that all the investments he made were legit and kept on investing more. In the next one month he invested another 10.5L(total 14L so far).\n\nNow in late august, according to the site, he had made approx $119000(roughly 1cr). When he tried to withdraw his money, the customer care said that to withdraw he needs to pay a tax of roughly 24 Lakhs. He asked them to deduct it from his profit but they said they can't deduct from a customers account and he needs to deposit that money. He went to the bank and sent the payment via RTGS. After this when he tried to withdraw, they asked for a foreign exchange fees and asked for another 8 lakhs. He with his closed mind (idk man what was going on in his head, im just ashamed of him atp) made that tranfer. This time after trying for withdrawal, they asked him for some other bs taxes worth 29 LAKHS. Now all the money he had was used and his bank was empty. Now you'll think a person in his right mind would stop, BUT NO. He broke some FD and withdrew 29 Lakhs. This is when my father got to know that an fd had been broken. He asked him what are you gonna do with that much amount and what happened to all the money you had. He just made some excuse which idk about(will probably post it in an edit), he asked him to stop and NOT INVEST WITHOUT CONSULTING HIM STRICTLY, he agreed to it with him but then made the deposit later that day🤡🤡(papa was out of town). I on a random went through his phone after this and got to know about all this blunder he had done, all the transactions were made to random accounts and the site he using was based on nginx and was basically a scam. After this when he tried to withdraw, they asked for another 14Lakhs taxes. The girl who used to guide him is saying ki just pay 5.6 lakhs and she'll pay the remaining. She is still active and in touch with him.  I told about all this to my parents and they have STRICTLY WARNED him to not make any transaction. Roughy 75 Lakhs have been lost so far and we can't even go to the police because all the online chats he has with girls🤡🤡, its just so shameful we cant even tell anyone. All out life savings are gone just like that. All of us are just blank atp and ashamed of this foolery. I am unable to sleep and so are my parents, grandmother does not know about all this.\n\nI know its all his fault and we've accepted that none of it will come back but still if someone can help, it'll do us a HUGE favour. We have nothing left now, all our savings and emergency funds are gone and we have nothing left🤡🤡. Will add more details in edit when i remember\n\nEDIT 1 --> He cleared all his chats with the girls after my father confronted him, only proofs that are available are the messages with the customer care(online scammer) of that so called website and the accounts given by him to make the transactions\n\nEDIT 2 --> I think im just helpless atp, can't file complaint cz parents said GF would have to confess which he wont. 2022 m 1-2 ghante baad hi complaint krdi thi ek penny wapas nahi ayi, ab toh 10 din hogye kya hi hoga. I dont think anything can be done now, they aren't allowing me to file a complaint. ig i should just accept it now and move on. Thank you for the help\n\nEDIT 3 --> I've mailed a bunch of youtubers who expose call centers/scammers online. This was all i could do in my power(im 17m after all). I know everyone has asked me to file a complaint but try to understand im helpless Its not about embarassment, more about the fact that my grandfather just wont admit and we are worried if he takes some serious step then we all will be blamed+ nothing happened last time(oct 2022) thats why parents believe police is worthless, we even wrote a letter to the pm last time, all in vain. There is a reason for their mind set",

        "title": "URGENT: Sexual video recording leaked online.",
        "text": "**Location**: Haryana, India**My age**: 23**Event**: My sister's first boyfriend recorded her video on WhatsApp in 2018-19 where she was showing her private parts. Using those videos and pictures, 5-6 boys blackmailed her to do sexual favours. We learned all about this, with her that time boyfriend (now her ex), and that something like this happened in 2021. She was so traumatised and she even tried to take her life. She was not mentally ready to go to the police and report this incident. This is what assumed looking at her situation. I tried to convince my parents to go to the police and report this but, they hesitated and they were so confused about what to do and we ended up doing nothing. She needed therapy and we did that. Now, those boys are not contacting her. But, her ex (the one who told us everything) was so madly in love with her and wanted to marry her. But, my sister was having her mental problems. The ex was not understandable. Till this point, she was having issues of PTSD, Borderline personality disorder (BPD), depression, anxiety, and suicide and she even cut her arm with the blade but those were not deep. So, she left her and then, after some time, she went back to him due to BPD but it ended up bad. Her ex tricked her into coming to some place and he mentioned that he had her videos and he had talked with her friends and blamed her for ruining her life and his too. She was shattered and she had an episode, where she lost her memory completely. She only remembered till class 9th. Her ex and his cousins, threatened us that time, that they would take my sister away. We spent almost 2 weeks at our aunt's house and his family members used to stalk our house. Now, this all thing happened in April last year. Some days ago, I found my sister's video on one of the porn sites and it was uploaded in April last year. Her ex must be behind this. Her ex tried to contact her recently (maybe because of Valentine's Day)  using someone who's in her batch. The site doesn't have a report button. I am unable to find the source of the video. I didn't tell my parents and her. She's still having issues and her therapist told us clearly, that we have to be vigilant of her. So, I cannot tell her anything and my mother is having depression issues. My father is almost at work. This will be very impactful for them. I was about to register the complaint on the cybercrime.gov.in website. But, I didn't. She's having her semester exam and her BPD symptoms have arisen.Please, help me. How can I take down the video and make sure, the person who uploaded it gets arrested? I don't want to involve my family in this. They still are having a hard time.\n\nEdit: \nThank you for the support everyone. \nI learn a lot of new things. I'll definitely convince my parents to do something about this and if they didn't, I'll take the matter into my hands.\nAll new suggestions are welcome.\nI don't want a single loophole to be present.\n",

        "text": "Supreme Court Awards ₹2 Crore Permanent Alimony To Estranged Wife Towards \"Decent Standard Of Living\"\n\nCASE: \n\n▪️This was wife's second marriage. She had received ₹40 Lakh in alimony from first husband as well\n\n▪️Her second marriage did not last beyond a year & parties had been living separately since nine years\n\n▪️Since there was no scope of parties co-habiting together again, Supreme Court dissolved the marriage under Article 142 of the Constitution\n\n▪️Husband works as a VP with a bank with a net income of ₹5 Lakh per month \n\n▪️Estranged Wife's current income is ₹1.39 Lakh per month, while she claimed her monthly expenses to be ₹4 Lakh per month, besides ₹75,000 per month for minor daughter (from first marriage)\n\nSUPREME COURT \n\n▪️A bench of Justices Vikram Nath & Prashant Kumar Mishra said:\n\n\"This court is of the opinion that the demand made by the appellant is exceptionally high, but, at the same time, the amount offered by the respondent is insufficient in the broader rubric of maintenance considerations.\"\n\nThe court thus fixed one-time settlement amount of Rs 2 crore as fair and balanced for permanent alimony to be paid by the husband within four months to cover all pending and future claims, keeping in view the totality of the circumstances, the social and financial status of the parties, their current employments as well as future prospects, standards of living, and their obligations, liabilities, and other expenses.\n\nVOICE FOR MEN (Twitter) INDIA TAKE \n\n▪️This is exactly the alimony payouts we are against\n\n▪️Why should a working woman whose marriage did not last even for a year get any alimony?\n\n▪️After wasting 9-years in lower and high courts, if husbands are anyways expected to pay permanent alimony in the name of \"financial security of estranged wife\", why is this amount not fixed on day 1 itself?\n\n▪️Why should husbands spend years of prime life & money on lawyers, if in the end it has to be #HePays \n\n▪️The alimony is granted based on the current income of the husband, while estranged wife has zero contribution in his life since 9-years\n\nOP's Take : Alimony should be given to wife on basis of duration of marriage. If marriage didn't last long for more than a year then why husband was asked to pay 2 crore.

        "title": "Update: Roommate was R@ped",
        "text": "Hi, First of all I would like to thank you all for your supporting and kind responses and secondary, sorry for not replying to anyone. A lot happened after I made the post but I won't go into much and every details as it is also difficult for me to share this. And please don't be judgemental or hateful towars me as I didn't had any wrong intention and made the post with genuine reasons. Below points will summarise the entire story-\n\nMy roommate= girl, Roommate's brother=bro, Roommate boyfriend=guy/bf.\n\n1. As I went of town, girl and guy had plan to spend time together alone in house. (She didn't told me that her bf would come in my absence before I left cause I would have been against it cause aunties create scene and complaint to landlord and families.)\n\n2. Her friends planned series of events to go to restraunt, theatre, pub and invited her to join. She ditched the bf and  went to friends. Bf pissed and told her to cancel but she denied.\n\n3. After pub she called bf to take her home and she will make up for lost time (with sex) as I was coming next day afternoon and they still would have enough time to enjoy.\n\n4. He agreed, picked her up at pub, took her home, they had sex. Then bf and girl had fight and disagreement, reasons- she ditched and also others things in their relationship and resulting into guy breaking up with her.\n\n5. The bite and some hitting marks (light red) on her body were for two reasons - a) they both are kinky in bed, which I knew before cause of girl talk, b) she maybe made some extra by herself for showoff \n\n7. After I made post I called her brother(without telling her), whom I knew is a good understanding guy cause she wasn't communicating with me properly and not taking any action. Didn't tell him anything but said it's important, urgent and she needs him.\n\n8. When her brother came she gave me really angry and hateful look but I still told her to tell her brother or I will. They had talk alone and brother took her to police station with teary and angry eyes. I went too without being asked specifically.\n\n9. At police station she told same story she told me but replaced stranger with bf coming forcefully with knife. I was shocked but thought she wasn't comfortable telling me cause I didn't like her boyfriend so I could be judgemental. \n\n10. Police called bf to come station urgently, before and without writing complaint.\n\n11. When he came,he  heard the allegations, got abused and almost hit by brother and was pale, teary and dumbfounded. Girl stayed silent entire time with her head down and hiding.\n\n12. Bf then took out his phone and showed call recording of girl telling to pick up and take her home and have sex and chats of planning their time together when I leave.\n\n13. Girl then started crying and said he is lying and it's fake, but when officer asked for her phone to check chats and call log      she got silent and turned pale.\n\n14. Then guy told the entire truth (which I mentioned from point 1 to point 5). After hearing all that, I left the police station after telling the brother I'm leaving cause it was all too much for me and I was at freaking police station for her for so long.\n\n15. Only other thing I know is brother has taken the girl to parent's house coming back home for packing stuff. I didn't asked anything cause I didn't want to embarrass him more or make environment uncomfortable but he thanked me and told me that matter is sorted and they are going to parents.\n\nAgain, sorry for making this update post little late as I was both afraid and ashamed to share all this cause I feel guilty too. The girl isn't exactly my much of a friend but roommate cause I knew she was kind of toxic and manipulative so I maintaned safe distance with her.\n\nThank You.\n\nEdit - A lot of people are saying that I was wrong to call her brother and I agree they are right from their POV but only because there was no actual rape and on assumption that she wouldn't have filled complaint if not because of me. But what I didn't mention is that I come from lawyer, police family background (but have no knowledge of these profession) and that's why she asked me what would be the effect of filing complaint and that's why I made the post. For me, my roommate told me that she was r@ped violently where I live at knife point, and then stopped communicating with me. I couldn't tell what was going in her mind, what if she falls into depression and the people get to know at late or attempt suicide or cut, harms her skin, body etc. I was also traumatized, scared and panicked and contracted her brother cause I knew he is understanding and level headed guy and it was a freaking rape on her sister. I was fine and supportive of her in case she choose not to file complaint but took things into my hand cause she stopped much talking and behaving wierdly which seemed dangerous and concerning in my head. \n\nPeople saying I'm controlling of her choice of boyfriend, I'm not, I'm controlling when some male stays at our mutual rented place cause as girl I live in society where people shame your character when guys come and overnight or any other time. I have got in trouble before for same reason because of her but got it sorted cause not my bf. \n\nAnd at last people saying it's fake, I wish it was.",

He didn't even pay a single visit with me clinics n started to act like a victim saying I seduced him into it n that's why it's my responsibility that I became pregnant. Immature person always blaming every shit in his life on me.\n\nI had to do everything alone coz I couldn't get family or friends involved. He never even proposed to marry me. I just asked my bf to help me through this but he instead pretended falling sick himself. Then he started to remote control the situation over calls n msgs. \n\nSuddenly he suggested coming over to take care of me when I said I want to think over my options with the baby. I soon discovered he only wanted to get rid of me. He made me forcibly drink shakes of raw papaya and mentally harassed me a lot. I can write details of how he caused this miscarriage if any specific questions. \n\nUnder his supervision I got very sick. After 3 days I started bleeding heavily. I visited clinic alone n doc informed me that I had miscarried. He ghosted me once he was convinced baby was no more.\n\nAfter my recent checkup with another gynae doc due to some ongoing issues I came to know that I have permanent complications in my body and it will  not be possible for me to conceive later. He has ripped off chances of me having a normal marriage/relationship with anyone in future. He threatened me not to tell anyone about all this ever. I want to make sure he is put in jail and rots there for his pre meditated crime.He threatened me several times.\n\nSometime has passed after this incident. He destroyed my medical records but I can retrieve from clinic.  \n\nWhat should I do guys? Should I talk to him? Should I confide in family first? Please suggest 🙏 \n\nEDIT : I can see that a lot of people are getting the wrong impression that I miscarried by drinking raw papaya juice.  It is just ONE of the many things that he did. It is not even be the primary cause but one of the factors that pushed this. There are several other very grave actions which he took. Also, by saying I wanted to explore my options with the baby, I meant that I clearly told him I wanted to know what was the best course of action by confiding in my known circle of doctors & friends. He cut me off from everyone and I did not get a chance to take a sound decision about the baby. Whether or not I wanted an abortion and how/where I wanted to get it done was something I was not given a chance to even think about. I was crapping and vomiting all week long due to unknown sort of food poisoning and then next I bled to the extent that I pleaded for death. This is not about papaya guys... please read the post carefully. Thanks for all the support.",

        "title": "My Ex, love of my life, filed false sexual harrasment charges. I came out clean. What action can I take when nobody seems to care? ",
        "text": "Brace yourselves for millennial drama! TL;DR in the end\n\nHello everyone! 4 years ago, my then live-in partner, filed a false sexual harassment case on me which made me run pillar to post in courts for all these years, only to see her not show up to the court at all. Finally, after four proclamations and an NBW, she shows up only to turn hostile in the box and deny her complaint. My spirit crushed right there. Here's how the story goes;\n\nThe two of us fell in love when I was 21 and she was 19. We're from Bangalore. Our relationship went on for two years before our parents found out. By then I had already materialised my brain-child of a start-up. So when confronted, my parents threatened to throw me out of the house if I chose her over them. Me being the righteous kind, said it wasn't fair on her, and obliged. At a very young age, I learnt how it feels to be dejected by your own. To make matters worse, they even had a tiff with the girl's side over the same. Succumbing to parental pressure, even the girl left her home (I wasn't notified, her eloping came out of the blue to me)\n\nBecause I already had a business up and running, I accepted her decision but we chose to live separately. She assisted me with client communication while I closed the deals and worked on projects. A year down the line, we moved into a flat, started living-in together. That's when the problems arose. She often kept stirring up inconducive conversations about how my parents had behaved with hers and how they were disturbed   and all. I kept telling her that what was important was that I was with her, away from my parents. But it gradually became a huge concern and things only went downhill then on. While I had no qualms with her going to meet her people, she made sure that I didn't reconcile with mine. She would often resort to self-sabotaging, slicing up her arm and whatnot whenever we had an argument. While I spoke as a team, she always considered me as an opponent in an argument.\n\nOne unfortunate day, I came back home only to see her pull off a gone girl. Poof! She was gone. What more, she had eloped with every single document that ever mattered to my existence. Starting from my bank cards to company documents to personal documents to vehicle documents to even the house key! \n\nNot only had I lost the one person who I fought the world for, I also had nothing to go on with. Four days later I learnt from her friend that she had been suggesting my girl to leave me for over a year, because she thought I wasn't the right match! Not only did she not return my stuff but also tried to get an equal share from my bank account because we were living-in. \n\nI was depressed, shut myself in, didn't even let my parents know, when all the while she had comfortably returned to her home. Seeing my condition deteriorate, my friends themselves informed my parents and they were once again back in my life.\n\nAfter failed pleas for a decent parting for over a month, I had to file a complaint in my local police station about my missing items. The cop was very kind to help me out with such a trivial matter. He fetched her location and sent me to retrieve my stuff only for me to realise that she had returned to her parents' native. I alone had to riskingly enter a village where I knew everybody would be hostile. It's a miracle I even made it out safe. The woman didn't budge. She kept saying everything was rightfully hers. Had to return empty handed because dare I not confront a 'woman' amongst her own people. \n\nTwo days later, the cop stepped his foot down and asked her to come down to the station along with her family. Once there, instead of responding to my complaint, she creates a hue and cry about how she's an equal shareholder and deserved to get half of my bank balance because we were in a live-in relationship. I held my ground but a few cop subordinates coerced me saying that I better give away the money otherwise she could very well press rape charges against me. I had no words. I was coerced into writing a cheque, only for me to realise that she along with her friend had forged up false documents to make the claim. \n\nMe being the righteous kind, said it wasn't done, and blocked the cheque (mind you, I blocked the cheque while maintaining sufficient balance). \n\nA month later, she slammed me with a cheque bounce case, alleging that cheque bounced due to insufficient funds. I couldn't care less. \n\nI appeared before the court and pleaded not guilty, said I'd fight it out. \n\nHer family and herself couldn't stand it at all. Parallely, they had to account for a random guy showing up at their native and also about her disappearance for two years. Us being from the same locality, they went around saying how I had married her and cheated on her, treated her the worst bla bla bla, and that they were gonna send me to prison. \n\nWhich they did, a month later. But never did they reveal to people on what charges and what case.\n\nHere's how the FIR went: \n\nThat she and I had met four years ago in some annual meet and that I had been persistently behind her since then, stalking her and forcing her to 'love me, love me'. And one fine day, I lost my shit, followed her, pulled her dupatta, outraged her modesty (a foolish attempt at bringing in IPC 354, 354A charges) and threatened her to love me or else I'd kill her entire family (IPC 506 😂Ik). \n\nThe joke of it all? I wasn't even in Bangalore on the said day!!! \n\nHere's a woman who in the beginning of the relationship had absolutely no hesitation to lie to me for sympathy points about how she was sexually abused and molested as a child!!! (women of reddit, please chime in as to whether anything can justify this!! I was too blind in love to overlook this, and had instead chosen to let go), and now she was lying through her teeth that I myself had tried to  harass her sexually.\n\nBecause she was a woman and brought in some influence, the police not only registered the complaint but also filed the FIR without any investigation. I was arrested in the night, wasn't told why, was kept in the cell overnight, was taken to the court next day. Despite it being a non-bailable offence (14-day remand a mandate), the judge saw through the truth of the matter instantly but A.P had gone home by then, it was 5pm. Unfortunately, I had to go to prison for one night (don't ask me how I came out sane. After what I saw inside, I doubt very few men can), was bailed out the next day. To my dismay, the police filed chargesheet with the only evidence in it being her statement along with her family's.\n\nCut to four years later, after countless sessions with my lawyers and in court, my fighting spirit had worn off. But since truths were by my side, although delayed, justice arrived. In both cases. \n\nI had come out clean from both the false charges (the cheque bounce and the sexual harrasment). The orders in the first stated she had miserably failed to make her case and that she had produced questionable evidences. In the second, the orders stated that she denied me ever outraging her modesty and that the incident never happened. \n\nFinally, after four years (COVID to top it off, business had fallen faceflat), I walked out of the court, spirit battered and bruised, but soul at peace, at last. \n\nMy battles are over, now is my time to salvage my life. There's absolutely no incentive for me to go back to the mess again. But me being the eccentric righteous kind, just can't get the matter out of my head. \n\nI cannot digest the fact that an individual can bring one's life to shambles with their malicious lies, all because they're from a particular gender/group. I'm not making this a man v/s woman issue. I'm making it a truth v/s lies issue. No lie should be able to reign supreme, no matter the difference is in gender, race, class, creed, age etc. \n\nI cannot stand the fact that a lie could be so loud and destructive whereas my truth when came out, came out in silence. The court acquittal orders were issued at around 3pm by a clerk in an empty court room, judge wasn't even around. Atrocities of the lies were loud, but my truth was barely a whimper.\n\nI've always believed that human suffering should amount to a difference in ways of the world. If one has suffered, he must strive to ensure someone else doesn't face the same fate. If suffering goes unquestioned, then really, what is the point of it all? Of this society? \n\nWith these thoughts in mind, I consulted my lawyers and I wanted to press more than civil defamation charges. I wanted to press criminal charges because it IS a criminal offence to file false FIRs, commit fraud and present false witnesses. My acquittal orders are already foolproof evidence to all these crimes. \n\n\nYet, yet....I have zero support. Parents brushed aside my rebuttal saying that I better not get into it again since she can come up with any cock-and-bull story. I can't even begin to explain to them how irrational their fear is. I didn't relent. Said I would take action myself with or without their help. Finally, they gave in, said that they'd press charges on my behalf as my parents and that I focus on my future.\n\nBelieving them, I moved to a new city for work and resumed my life. Now, suddenly, they're singing a different tune. That they're too old to be taking all this stress, that they tell it for my own food, and that I should let it go too.\n\nI cannot even!!!!! Now, I'm stuck in a different city, with all the trauma, and all alone! If I wanna go back and take up the matter myself, I'll jeopardize my work, and I can't trust my parents to ever stand for me. \n\nSo here I am, desolated from my homeland, dejected by my own, and destroyed by the only person I ever chose to love the most. \n\nWhat respite do I have? What action can I take? I'm no Johnny Depp, why would the world care when my own parents didn't? How can I, being thousands of miles away, even start to take legal action over this? \n\nIt's actually super easy and convenient for me to put it all behind, but I simply cannot. If my own well-to-do parents would rather disown me again than stand by me just because it's a woman on the other end, what hope does any average man in India have? What hope does truth have over lies?\n\nI need help. So that with my voice, I can help to ensure no other soul succumbs to malice in this deceitful world. That one day, I can fearlessly call out my perpetrator and encourage others to do the same.\n\nHumans of Reddit, I appeal to you. Please help! \n\nTL;DR - I left my parents for my love. \n              My love left me for her parents.\n              Her parents abetted her in framing me with false charges. \nI came out clean.\nNow my parents will neither let me fight the lie nor do they help me fight the lie. \n\nAnd I cannot let my suffering go pointless, since things REALLY need to change in this country. Old outdated laws must have no place. No woman should have unquestioned power to indict a man where he has no say. No lie should be more powerful than the truth. Help!",

        "title": "My neighbor beaten me out of ego - Malviya Nagar, New Delhi ",
        "text": "Hello everyone, here is a video that I managed to capture while my neighbor (Deepak Sharma aka Deepak Chowdhary) was beating me with a heavy stick for no valid reason.\n\nWhat actually happened: \nI stay in a rented flat in Panchsheel Vihar, Malviya Nagar, New Delhi. Deepak, along with his brother and his entire family has recently purchased a flat in the same building where I have been residing. Now they wish to get hold on the entire building and on it’s parking space. To do so, they act as goons & create hooliganism.\n\nThis entire scene started as soon as I came downstairs with my pet dog to take him for a regular walk around noon of 20th July, 2024. Deepak obstructed my way and asked me to park my car ‘tameez se’, though my car was already parked decently. Also, Deepak has a separate space dedicated to park his car, still he has been trying to provoke me to fight with him for months over parking. On this day, right after a brief dialogue which he initiated with me, he suddenly started beating me. He already planned this entire incident and this is why he had the lathi pre-arranged around that space (downstairs - he stays on 2nd floor).\n\nDuring this, I called 112 and called my brother who is a practising lawyer in Delhi. Soon after my brother arrived at the place of this incident, the PCR arrived too. However, Deepak, his brother Pradeep, his father and some of his friends (Deepak’s father is famous as Chowdhary chai wala in that area) again beaten me and my brother in front of the PCR. We were being beaten by an entire mob at that time and hence we rushed to enter in the PCR to save our lives. Then the PCR took us for medical which took almost 5 hours to get completed. We were not supposed to leave the hospital unless the medical process was completed. The police/PCR left us at the hospital.\n\nIn the evening when we were discharged from the hospital, we reached at Malviya Nagar (New Delhi) Police Station to file a written complaint about this incident. There, we got to know that a false complaint has already been filed by Deepak’s wife that we have misbehaved with her. This is an absolutely fake complaint, neither me nor my brother even touched her. We were infact struggling to save ourselves from the mob that was beating us.\n\nWhat followed next:\n1. The incident happened on 20th July and I reported the same to police on the same day. However, police refused to give me a receiving on my complaint, no FIR was filed on my complaint. In fact, police started threatening me that Deepak’s wife has also submitted her complaint that I molested her and if I will ask police to take any action against Deepak, police will arrest me for molesting his wife.\n2. I posted this incident on insta as a reel and luckily the reel went viral. Soon after that, ACP Hauz Khas intervened and assured me that appropriate action will be taken. After ACP’s intervention, FIR was filed during the late hours of 24th July. \n3. Though FIR has been filed, no further action has been taken by police yet. Neither Deepak has been arrested yet nor police has recovered the danda yet. My IO (investigating officer) hardly picks up my call. \n4. Deepak is trying to dilute the incident. Right after he beaten me, he yelled that I misbehave with his children (not true). When the matter reached to police, he said that I misbehaved with his wife (not true). And now he is telling the neighbors that I threatened his father and misbehaved with his father (not true).\n5. I am getting pressurised by locals to compromise with Deepak. \n\nFacts:\n1. This entire incident was preplanned by Deepak in advance. He pre-arranged the danda at ground floor (near the staircase), though he and his family stays on 2nd floor.\n2. He consciously chose to beat me at such a spot which isn’t covered by any CCTV. If I wouldn’t have recorded the incident myself, I would have never been able to defend myself against his wife’s fake complaint. \n3. I wasn’t beaten by Deepak after any heated argument, I was beaten because Deepak planned to beat me. That is why he obstructed my way and initiated a dialogue with me at the first place. \n4. The beat officers (policemen who regularly take rounds to ensure safety of general public) are regular visitors of Deepak’s father’s chai shop. \n5. Last year, Deepak and his brother Pradeep tried to allege me that I stole their 1.5 lacs cash that they forget after keep the cash on my car. They even got a policeman who happens to be a friend to them, to investigate this matter. Interesting part: they never filed any complaint regarding this, the policeman came just in yaari, and later Deepak’s brother and the policeman both apologised in writing for conspiring against me. \n6. Deepak’s father has a chai ki dukaan (Chowdhary chai wala) in this same area and they have been staying in the same locality for around 30+ years (before purchasing the flat, they had another property in the same locality). They are trying to ignite the influential people (localites) of the locality that I regularly misbehave with everyone and since I am a bechelor, I shall not be allowed to stay in their locality (please note that I have been staying in this flat since 2015).\n\nThis is a clear case of conspiracy where pro-female laws are being misused to defend Deepak’s act.\n\nWhat am I seeking from you?:\nI’m seeking your help to teach a life lesson to Deepak while staying within the limits of law. Today, it was me, tomorrow, it may be you or your kid. People like Deepak are a threat to the society and since such people aren’t afraid of law, they do whatever they wish to.\n\nUnfortunately, the laws in our country are a joke. If a person isn’t influential or isn’t having funds, it’s next to impossible to get timely justice. This is not just my fight against Deepak, but our collective fight for humankind against unsocial elements like Deepak and corrupt system.\n\nOn the viral reel that I posted, I got a lot of support as well as a lot of criticism. Most of the support was in the form of- Deepak ka address do, or, Deepak ka number do, hum abhi theek karte hai usko. However, this is not what I think is right. We must unite and get the system pressurised to serve justice in this case.",

I was saved from dying, only to be reminded daily by my family that they wish I hadn’t survived.\n\nMy Mother: My mother loves wearing the mask of the perfect wife and mother, carefully crafting her image for the world. It doesn’t matter how much it crushes her own family. Her hatred toward me runs so deep that I don’t know if I can even call it gender discrimination because my older sister is cherished like a princess while I’m treated as if I’m the family’s greatest mistake. Why? I don’t know.\n\nShe’d say things like, *\"Bhagwan kare tu banjh nikle\"* (God willing, you end up infertile), whore, *\"Bachpan mein hi zinda jala ke maar dena chahiye tha\"* (You should’ve been burned alive in childhood), \"shaadi k baad aiso ko hi pati jala k maar dete h\" (girls like you are burnt to death by their husbands after marriage) and many more vile comments which are normalized for me in this house.\n\nHer violence is just as relentless. Belts, hangers, rods, PVC pipes, brooms anything within reach became a weapon. Once, I came 3rd in my class, and instead of being proud, she threw a carton full of cockroaches at me. When my father left for Chandigarh for a week, she locked the kitchen and let me starve. I was a child then, crying for food, and all she did was pretend she cared in front of others. She tells people she’s so weak, so selfless, the perfect mother. But behind the curtain, she tells me daily that I should’ve died when I had the chance. She’ll smile for the world, and behind closed doors, she carves wounds deeper than any disease ever could.\n\nMy Father: He’s the only one who asks if I’ve eaten, the only one who cares about the bruises on my body. But he refuses to see her for what she is. “Adjust,” he says. “She’s your mother. She can’t be wrong. Some people don’t even have mothers, and you do.” I love him. I love him so much it hurts, his inability to stand by me, his blind love for her hurts me. It feels like betrayal, though I know he means well. I love him so much, but his refusal to see what’s happening breaks my heart into pieces I can’t even count.\n\nMy younger brother: My younger brother, who’s in 11th, doesn’t respect me. He’s exactly like our mother. She’s shaped him to be her mirror image. He beats me, abuses me, and calls me a whore. He doesn’t even treat me like a human being. This Rakhi, I refused to tie him a rakhi, but my father forced me to. I can’t believe he’s my brother. I see other classmates’ brothers and wonder what it feels like to have a good relationship with a brother. Do they fight and then apologize? Do they care about their sisters? I’ll never know. I’m too unfortunate.\n\nMy Older Sister: She wasn’t just my sister, she was my first best friend. We’re almost two years apart, and despite the discrimination I faced, it never affected our bond. When my mom beat me, she was the first person I went to. I told her everything. About school, the hospital, my life. But everything changed when she moved to another state for studies a year ago. She cut all ties with me. When I messaged her, she left me on read. Every day, I felt abandoned. Now I have no one to talk to. This made me feel unworthy of love or time, and I broke ties with everyone, even the 2-3 school friends I used to talk to online.\n\nI’ll start college next year because my mother refused to pay for any private college this year. I’ll appear for CUET next year. I begged to enroll in the CA Foundation course, and I’ll appear for the exam in January 2025. But the daily mental and physical abuse is testing me. This isn’t the life I imagined as a child. They made me hate my younger self, who was just a victim of a toxic family and environment.\n\nI asked my father to let me study at a library, but my mother straight-up told me to rot at home. Today, my brother beat me again in front of them. My father lightly scolded him, and my mother took his side. I see no meaning in life. Don’t have kids if you’re going to treat them like this. I attempted suicide many times but failed miserably because I don’t want to die. I want to live a normal life like girls my age. dress up cutely, travel, go out with friends, and be loved by my parents. I want to have a *Tom and Jerry* relationship with my siblings. Maybe not this, but I hope in another life, I have a happy home with parents and siblings who love me.",

        "text": "My friend's father (age: 58, ex army) is charged with rape and arrested on 15th June 5:30 AM. He is a grocery store owner and a reputed salesman of a cosmetic company. The girl resides in a house which is absolutely opposite to my friend's house. The girl and his brother often go to my friend's (age: 28) house when their parents are going somewhere or visiting a doctor as I am told. The relation between the two houses has always been good as I am told. The father of the victim has a Reliance petrol pump in our locality so their monetary condition is good as my friend's mother also works as a matron in a Govt. hospital so both families are pretty wealthy. \n\nOn the day of 14th June a little girl who is 3.5 years of age had come to their house to play with my friend's father. She came to their house for a long time to play and my friend's parents bought her toys and plushies so she plays happily. The accused is said to rape the little girl at around 2 pm to 2:30 pm. then the girl went to her home. And as per daily routine my friend's father opened his shop in the evening under is house and attended the shop alone till 10:30 pm. After 10:30 pm the victim's father came and asked my friend's father to follow him to their house and they insulted him there saying that he molested their child. When my friend's father asked to see the girl and asked her what have he done to hurt her, she replied \"You gave me pain in\" and when he asked \"where have I gave you pain?\" then the girl pointed towards her private part. \n\nSince then the man is in jail, I have known him for about 10 years and I have never felt such dark aura from him so I could believe this story. I have been told that the girl was tested and the report was undisclosed by the victim's family. 1st hearing was on 23rd of June where the court could not proceed with the hearing due to lack of evidence and the report not being present. \n\nHe has been charged with pocso 4 and 8 I don't know what that means. The girl was tested again on 22nd june which is 8 days after the incident and the reports are still pending. The next hearing is on 7th July. \n\nAny advice how to deal with the situation? my friend is pretty absent minded and he can not tell me all the details the lawyer has said him, he is hiding behind his mother. His mother is also physically ill due to the shock.  \n\n\n\n\nUpdate: Next hearing has been scheduled on 17/07/23. My friend has not given me or my other friends any update on the case and completely blames the victim's family for reason he himself can not sepecify anymore in detail. He started working two jobs and IDK what was the urgency of getting two jobs at this moment, while he had been jobless for more than 5 years. Not putting my nose where it doesn't belong anymore.",

        "text": "\nAs you guys would’ve heard about the Atul Subash case. I wanted to draw light upon the similar incident we as a family are facing on a regular basis at home from the past 15 years.\nMy uncle(mamu) brilliant guy did his Btech(IIT Kharagpur) MBA (Harvard). Was at once handling 33 countries at Yahoo back in 2008-09.\nHe married this girl in 2008. Girl was of Noida. Has 2 daughters with her. They after marriage were living in Bangalore.\nThe girl ran away from home took all the property papers. We came to know about the 2nd child later on. Wouldn’t let my mamu meet his children. He literally pleaded her in front of her family.\nFiled a fake case against my family that they used to beat her and ask for money. Everything fake. Hacked into our income tax records to know our property. Demands 4Cr. My mamu left his job 8-9 years back. In his words he said ,’kya fayda iss paise ka’.\nNanaji and mamu used to go to noida from Chandigarh(out home city) for every single case hearing. The distance roughly is 300km one way. Mind that they did this for every hearing and most times when they arrived there the hearing was cancelled. \nThe girl’s father is retired army officer. They judge ordered monthly maintainence charges although my mamu is jobless.\nBoth nana-nani suffered heart attacks and has to go bypass 2 times. Nani is diabetic too. They developed these as a result of increased stress.\nFew days back the girl’s father gave bribes to delhi police and they came all the way to Chandigarh and arrested my nanu without any warrant. We told them that he was a heart patient and let him carry his medications and please cooperate but all in vain and was driven to delhi and locked up for the night. Call it harassment. We told the judge. Again all in vain.\nThe girl and her dad secretly paid out lawyer which we were too late to notice . They even bribed every judge that was on the case. All results in their favour. We are still fighting that case 15 years later.\nThrough my eyes you can see my family suffering every single day, the pain of my grandparents, the whole tension in the house, all the craze for the festivals is gone and everyone is just waiting for the day when it’ll be finally over. I just want my old family back where we celebrated festivals with fun, where i can wait for my mamu bringing gifts whenever he goes abroad for work, where we as a family go to drop him to delhi airport for his flight, where he is happily married, where my grandparents are finally living not just for the sake of it, where they don’t have to worry about the police coming again,where we live as a normal family which has done nothing wrong but just living how the circumstances prevail.\nThank you for listening everyone. Each and every part above written is true.\n\nUpdate- Again an arrest warrant has been issued against my mamu for not paying monthly maintainence. Our latest lawyer is also compromised.\nThe girl has a well paying job at NIFT delhi as a lecturer.\nOne request guys can anyone of you send this post to deepika bhardwaj on twitter. My twitter account keeps on shutting down.\nRegards",

She hates everyone of them. I have a bunch of cousins too. I do weekend calls with them, but my wife hates them too.\n\nShe has her reasons, and I am 100% aware of her differences with my family members, and I sympathise with her but, it is very very tough. She only talks to her parents and her younger brother. Whenever, any topic of my family comes up, she just loses it. So of course, we ensure that we never bring up my family discussions, cuz that just spoils hours and days cuz of all the fighting. Yes, I have been the asshole in multiple situations as well, and I own up to them, but mistakes happen. As adults, I thought we can take it in our stride and move on, but enough is enough.\n\nI had forced her to join cult classes so that she gets to step out and get a social life, but she stopped those classes after a few months. She is suffering in her job, but she doesn't study, and doesn't try to switch out either.\n\nMy younger bro lives 5 KM away from me, but if I try to meet him, she gets furious and starts fighting with me.\n\nI am married for 2.5+ years and other than the first 4-5 months, for the past 2 years, it has been like this. Situation is only deteriorating. Of course, we have a dead bedroom for more than 1.5 years now. We have sex like once in 2 months. That also, is if something really passionate happens, like if we watched a romcom movie. I don't see us having it now, cuz I have just developed a mental block towards her now. We are literally dragging the relationship now and pretending to have feelings for one another.\n\nI would like to initiate divorce as I can't let this much toxicity affect my life. Where do I start? Please recommend lawyers or counsellors.\n\n  \nP.S.: I have posted similar stuff earlier as well, but folks, believe me, nothing has progressed since then. It is a cold war right now and prolly more intense now. I am looking for direction to proceed, that's all.",

        "text": "Hello, this is my first time posting here. Me and my friends are right now in a very troublesome situation. We are college students, in our 5th semester, and we organised an event to welcome our juniors who joined our department this year. For this event we ordered food in bulk from a restaurant which is around 30mins away from our venue. Till the day of the event the owner told us to receive the food at around 12:30 in the afternoon but on the day of the event he suddenly changed it to 11:30. One friend of ours was supposed to go get the food using a cab. He was late because we were not prepared to go one hour early on that short notice. He reached there at around 12:00 - 12:15, took some time to load the food on our AC cab and brought back the food. We started distributing the food packets after 20-30mins after he arrived at our venue with them. That would be around 2:00PM - 2:10PM. Immediately people complained that the food was spoiled. And they were right. It was extremely spoiled. Panicking we looked for alternatives and ordered the same thing from Swiggy in bulk. When we finished ordering and apologising to everyone we called the owner and he shrugged if off saying \"I was there when everything was made\", then he called his chef, he recorded the call and sent us that recording. Basically he said \"I have everything to prove that I sent fresh food, I don't know how you guys handled it\" pointing the blame to us. We spent double the original money to get everything settled. Later at night we asked for a refund and coincidentally he started receiving bad reviews on Google Maps Businesses, Zomato, Swiggy. He related that with us saying \"Either you get the refund or you can keep on posting bad reviews\". We told him that untill further discussion we won't post anything but if this doesn't get settled the only way we as mere college students can take some action is post reviews letting everyone know about our experience. But the reviews didn't stop as we the organizing team can't control all the 100+ guests. On total till now there are maximum 12-15 reviews spread across various apps (5-6 on Maps, 2-3 on Zomato as far as I know). He's now threatening us with legal action saying that we have been mentally harassing him with all the planned \"fake\" reviews and defaming his restaurant on the internet. It's way more complicated than this but then writing everything down will take me a full day. Please give us advice on what should we do and you need clarification on any part, I will try to fulfil that as much as I can.\n\nEdit: The owner has asked us to arrange a meeting where he will bring his lawyer.\n\nUPDATE: we got a call recording between the chef and the restaurant owner where they are openly claiming that the rice being used was from the last night saying \"when we took out the rice from the refrigerator it was still intact\"\n\nis it usual for restaurants to use rice from previous nights for bulk orders? can we go forward with this point against the owner?\n\n\nUPDATE 2: we had the meeting today (23rd Aug), we went with one of our friend's relative who's a lawyer, he helped a ton, the owner actually brought his own lawyer as well although the lawyer didn't say anything during our discussion. finally we came to the conclusion that he'll try to make amends, although he hasn't declared how much he'll be paying back yet but we are right now at a higher ground.\n\nthanks a ton for all your suggestions and advice, it really helped, you have no idea how much you guys boosted our confidence.\n\nthanks again :)",

Someone came inside behind her (probably knew she was drunk) through door when she was getting inside home and forcefully raped her. She couldn't scream or resist as he had knife and she was not in whole proper consciousness and froze out of fear. But there are biting and hitting marks on her body. She can recognise the guy's face but doesn't know him or ever seen him.This happened on night of 6th oct and she has only told me about this when I came next day afternoon (7th oct). She hasn't taken bath or eaten anything except a I-pill cause guy didn't used condom so dna evidence is available. Thre aren't any cameras around our place(I checked and asked around) and none of neighbours saw anything (cause aunties would have created ruckus if they saw or knew a guy getting in girls house) and road was also empty as it was late night. I told her to go to police but she is concerned that her image and life will suffer consequences and the guy will not even get caught. She may not be able to recall the face clear enough for sketch like in tv serial cause of alcohol (which people can fail to do so without alcohol) and even if she could it doesn't guarantee him being caught. So please advice what chances does she stand of recieving justice and what proper procedure should she follow? Will police be of any help in investigation and what kind of things she will have to go through and for how long? What should she be ready for or expect to happen or will happen if the rapist is caught and/or not caught? Can whole fir and court proceedings be done without anyone outside, including her parents knowing? And will dna be enough for police to find the rapist? Please also provide any other information or advice as lawyer or someone who had gone through same thing which can be helpful.",

A few months ago, I needed money to pay part of the payment for the house, so I took a personal loan from Cred.\n\nNow that the house is ready, I need funds for the interiors. I approached my bank, and they happily sanctioned a top-up loan on my existing home loan. However, to disburse the money, they require me to close the personal loan I have with Cred. Since I don’t have the funds to close the personal loan myself, the bank has offered to close it on my behalf and disburse the remaining amount from the sanctioned top-up loan to me.\n\nFor this process, the bank needs a foreclosure letter from Cred. Unfortunately, Cred has informed me that they don’t provide foreclosure letters. The only way to close the loan is through their app, but I don’t have the funds to do so (the loan amount is approximately ₹4 lakhs). I also tried contacting Cred's lending partner, LiquiLoans, but they are not responding to emails or calls.\n\nNow I am stuck in a difficult position. I can’t pay the full amount to the interior company to complete the work, and my financial situation is at risk of being ruined—all because Cred is not providing a foreclosure letter.\n\nI don't understand, why can't they provide foreclosure letter, they are getting their money back. based on my research all the financial institutions are providing foreclosure letter. What's wrong with cred.\n\nI am sorry, if this is not an appropriate sub to post. I don't know what else to do. Any suggestions/help will be appreciated.\n\nThank you",

It all started 4-5 months ago when my cousin (her mom) found out that my niece was texting him. He’s the relative of one of her friends. When my cousin found out, she punished her and went to the boy’s house to talk to his parents, explaining that he’s an adult and my niece is just 12. They promised it wouldn’t happen again, and we all thought everything was resolved.\n\nToday, my cousin and her husband visited our home, and I wasn’t fully aware of the situation until now. My cousin shared that she’s still suspicious and caught my niece chatting with him again, this time through a hidden app. I figured out the password for the instagram and went through their messages, and what I saw completely shattered me. The innocent and loving image I had of my niece is gone. They met once in person, and there were explicit photos of them kissing. He’s an addict and a pervert who’s been grooming her, but he manipulated her into sending nudes, sharing porn, and even forcing her and emotionally manipulating her to send him money for alcohol. I literally lost it and vomited after seeing their sexting. As an adult, I would think twice before engaging in something like that, and she’s just 12.\n\nI showed everything to my cousin and her husband, and I strongly urged them to take legal action because she’s a minor about to turn 13, and he’s 21.\n\nI need advice on what we can do to bring this situation back to normal and what legal steps we can take. Any help or guidance would mean a lot right now and also which subs will be helpful if i post it there.\n\nEdit: Not my niece's personal phone she doesnt have one she's using my sister's phone andher grandma's phone. sorry i wrote not solely blamming the boy thinking someone might put blame on us for blamming the boy only as shes also equally involved not in my correct senses since morning.",

She had tried to inform about these to her mom, my mom and even the guy's mom but nobody was willing to believe her and also said that she's trying to wreck our family.\n\nMy sister was literally shivering while telling me this. And I couldn't stop crying. It is so distressing and still breaks my heart. I couldn't imagine the things she had gone through. Our family will collapse if we move on to any legal actions. And I'm not aware of the legal formalities here. Can we file a rape case after all these years? Would it be included in the pocso category even if she files the case as an adult? I'm so sad by hearing all these. I want that moron to be punished and rot behind the bars. But my sister is really scared of the family drama. And how can I help boosting her courage and comfort her? I'm concerned about her mental health as well. Idk what to do. This is so sad. Need help.",

        "title": "Caught a Thief Who Stole ₹1.95L from My GF’s Dad, but Now the Cops Are After Me – Need Advice",
        "text": "Hey everyone, this is my first post, so please excuse any mistakes. I’m 22M and a second-year law student at Delhi University.\n\nEarlier today, my girlfriend’s dad went out to buy groceries and ended up befriending someone. Unfortunately, this guy saw his debit card PIN, stole the card, and withdrew ₹1,95,000 in multiple transactions. We only realized what had happened in the evening.\n\nWith the help of a mutual friend who had been with them, we tracked the guy down. He was acting innocent and even came with us to the police station, pretending to help. The police also suspected him and registered our complaint, asking us to return the next day once they check the cameras as it was too late and the stores and ATMs had probably shut. After that, my girlfriend’s dad did not come with us.\n\nSince we were sure he was the one, we bluffed and told him we had CCTV footage. That’s when he confessed and agreed to return the money. But soon after, he switched off his phone. Panicked, we searched for him all over Sector 56, Gurgaon, and even asked the police to check his house around 11 PM. They told us to go home, but just as we were leaving, the mutual friend informed us that the thief was planning to escape to Jammu.\n\nAt this point, we had a choice—leave it to the cops (who had done nothing so far) or take action ourselves. Despite being scared, my girlfriend, her mom, and I decided to go out one last time. I knew the risk involved, but I wasn’t going to let him get away. We eventually found him in Sikanderpur, one of the sketchiest areas in Gurgaon. This place is known to be a red-light area, and it was definitely not safe for my girlfriend and her mom to be there at that hour. As soon as the thief saw me, he ran. At that moment, I knew I had to act. I chased him down, pushed him so he fell, and held him down while calling the cops.\n\nThis was honestly one of the bravest things I’ve ever done. I was terrified, but I still did what was right. In a city where people hesitate to step up, I literally did the police’s job for them.\n\nSeeing the commotion, some people nearby asked what was happening. When they heard that he had stolen money and was trying to run, around 10–12 guys gathered and started beating him. We tried to stop them (I even got punched in the process), but it escalated quickly. Under pressure, the guy returned some money and tried running again, which led to another round of beatings. Eventually, he gave back around ₹1,75,000.\n\nAt this point, we were genuinely scared. Sikanderpur is not a safe area, and with 12 unknown guys surrounding us, we were worried that they could turn on us at any moment or even run away with our money. We just wanted to leave. I spotted a police car and flagged them down. They caught him, and soon after, the officers from Sector 56 arrived.\n\nThat’s when things got messy. The police didn’t scold us—they outright told me that the thief would be charged with theft, and I would be charged with “maar-peet” (assault). It felt like a warning. I told them I didn’t hit him, but the bystanders did. The thief himself even told the cops that we didn’t harm him, and I recorded a video of him saying that. But the police looked pissed, especially after I recorded the video, and now they’ve asked us to come to the station at 9 AM tomorrow. They also suspect the involvement of the mutual friend.\n\nNow I’m feeling really anxious. I didn’t do anything wrong—I literally did their job for them. I was scared but still stepped up and showed courage. And yet, instead of being appreciated, I’m the one being threatened. We’re relieved to have gotten most of the money back and are fine with not pressing charges, considering the thief’s sad personal situation.\n\nWhat should we do now? Should we proceed with the charges despite not wanting to? Can the cops actually take action against me? They seemed really pissed off. Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nUPDATE: The parents went to the police station, around 20k are still to be recovered and the guy is saying he will pay back. I am not sure of the details because I am in college, but the parents have “thanked” the police people for being there yesterday, and nothing has really happened so far. I will update further.",

In 2017 one month before moving to USA, I visited her for regular cleaning and at the end of it, I discussed that I am thinking of getting a normal teeth whitening through bleaching. She told me bleaching is not a good option and rather than that she will apply a paint. The paint is basically the composite resin and procedure is known as dental bonding. This is not a recommended procedure for teeth whitening because it catches a lot of stain and composite resin doesn’t last and is not strong enough as enamel. She hid all those details from me. \n\nI was naive enough to trust her and I went ahead with her suggestion. She didn’t inform me fully about the procedure and when she started rather than applying the paint she started  eroding all my front teeth enamel. When I realized I started yelling and started giving her signs to stop through my hand gestures but she didn’t care to stop and throughout this she was using the machine aggressively. My consent for eroding the teeth was not taken and I wasn’t informed of that and she didn’t find it important to inform me fully about the procedure as well.\n\nAfter treatment , I confronted her so she casually said “ oh, I just removed the margin” which was utterly bulllshit. She completely disregarded what I was trying to say. \n\nI visited her so many times even after that in few weeks because I was so unhappy with the procedure and the material she applied was really low quality and it started cracking the next day itself. Despite knowing my situation she didn’t do anything and acted very rude and negligent. Obviously she knew I am anyway leaving India so she can’t do anything. \n\nBasically she experimented on me without reading about the dental bonding procedure. She knows she might face negligence charges so she is acting all innocent and claiming that my teeth were already damaged. When police visited her, she refused to provide my medical records and said she lost it. \n\nI am in so much pain because of her actions. I have no enamel left on my teeth and I am experiencing pain 24/7. I have undergone chipping correction 7-8 times so far and I experience dental sensitivity all the time. \n\nI never wanted to boast it but since I can see some of you are speculating my credentials and knowledge on how naive, illiterate or ill-informed I am about the modern day dentistry, let me share something about me, I am a very qualified researcher working in one of the biggest institutions in America currently , I have a PhD and I do hold a green card and multiple international awards overseas which I got based on my exceptional credentials in my field. Just wanted to let you know this in case you question my knowledge about things. \n\nI think this is high time people need to learn to take a lesson on how to be sensitive rather than questioning them. I am not deriving any pleasure from dragging someone down for no reason and this is not fun for me. What happened to me can happen to anyone. I am just sharing my experience so people can be careful and not fall for such fraudulent unethical doctors.\n\n\nYou can doubt me as much as you want but I have better things to do in life rather than falsely accusing someone for no reason. I have never done that and will never do that. \n\nAll I wanted was to spread awareness against her so no one else will suffer. But in case you don’t trust me, go ahead get yourself treated from her and see the result. God bless you all. ",

It would never go beyond hugging and kissing. He would avoid kissing me on my lips. He tells me he is straight and is interested in woman but I think he is asexual. We have been sleeping in the same bed for last one year and we haven’t even taken off our clothes forget consummation. Also I have fallen out of love with him experiencing his neglectful, uncaring and unloving behaviour towards me. I don’t see a future ahead and I have waited long enough.

        "text": "42F here! Got into arranged marriage at the age of 27,  been in an abusive marriage for almost 6 years, tried almost everything to have a happy family with him but the guy rejected all the efforts. We were childless and it came out my husband needed medical help. I begged him to take the medicines but he refused everything and finally I filed for divorce.\n\nMy Husband never showed up at almost every court hearings and literally wasted another 5 years of my life in court. After being emotionally devastated for a decade I met a guy(divorced) who wanted to marry me. We shared a good bonding and I’ve thought maybe he is the one for me. The court, like always, was giving future dates and finally declared if my husband does not appear in court they will grant me divorce on the basis of ‘Ex-Parte Decree’. This guy persuaded me to get married to him asap and said “he did not want to live another day without me and people get away with murders and you are only going to get love of your life”.\n\nI was so much in love and trusted him blindly, got married(I was 37 then) to him in a jiffy and got my divorce from my first husband 2 months later. Things were good initially but it turned out to be the biggest mistake of my life. He drank and smoked too much and was very abusive under the influence of alcohol. I got pregnant with him and was hoping things would eventually turn out good for me after he became a father but I was wrong again. He literally beated me when I was 7 months pregnant and I have called my parents to take me with them for fear of any serious injury or any harm may happen to my unborn child…\n\nHe did not initiate any sort of communication after I left, I was blessed with a kid 2 months later. When my parents called his parents with the good news they kind of hesitated to talk and refused to discuss my homecoming. When my parents visited them at their house to discuss things in person they verbally abused my parents and asked us not to visit them again. This guy has told us that this marriage is not valid in the court of law acc. to hindu marriage act (as i was married to him 2 months before i got divorce from my 1st husband) and also threatened that he would take legal action against me and my family for cheating with him if we tried to reach him or his family again, he also said he did not want to have any kind of relationship with me or with his child. I was devastated again in life. I have been waiting for him ever since.\n\nIt has been 4 years now. My son is 3.5, and has never seen his father. I came to know that he has married again and I was devastated again in life. My parents are asking me to think about my future as it would be too hard to be a single parent. IDK what options do i have now, Parents are asking to get married again and IDK what legal trouble i could get into or do i need any closure from my second marriage as it was not registered in the court of law. Please give me some advice.\n    \np.s. Posting this on behalf of Sister's friend",

I am her younger brother and don't want my sister to suffer anymore. She was like my mentor whole life and I was not aware she is suffering this much alone.\n\nI have all sympathy with fake cases filed on men but as a man myself I feel women are still just an object and need more rights and laws in their favour. \n\nTLDR : sister got beatenby husband and in-laws but there is not proof like major injury.

We left home without even a single cloth and got settled in another city.  \nSo, my questions are,  \n1- How can I save my ancestral land from them so that they do not give it to anyone else?

But it made me angry enough to confront her.\n\nSo after playing badminton, i usually drive her home as we're practically neighbors, her house is 4 houses ahead of mine. So while driving i asked her if she wants to have some ice tea, our regular beverage after playing. We stopped and i started voice recorder in my phone to record everything (i kept the phone hidden and she didn't knew about it) . I asked her, straight away what happened and why she did it. She denied it a few times. Then i changed my tone to suggest as if i am conforming that if she's interested in me. Then she accepted doing it, then she told me the purpose that she felt curious how 'manly' things down there works. I told her that she literally confessed to a crime. She nodded. Then i asked some questions like did someone asked her to do so, or have i touched her, or if i was conscious or not, or i have made her uncomfortable/threatened her before, have i crossed the line with her anytime. Obv all the answers were no, then i asked the 2 big questions. Q1. Have i physically ever did anything wrong with you that i shouldn't have done. She replied with no. Q2. I asked her if she thinks that me dating her is right. She said yes. Then i clarified her that an adult with such relations with a minor is a crime and it will be better for both of us that she treat me as an elder brother. Then she said such words which never should've came from a minor mouth. She said as long as we're having fun and no one knows about it, we're fine. And i gave her 20 mins lecture on how its wrong. After this almost 1 hour long conversation i told her that all this was recorded. She immediately went blank, started to cry. I told her that this is to teach her a very important lesson, and i won't be telling this to anyone. Its just for my safety. She was panicking after that and i told her that she is fine, i won't tell anyone, and she should stop calling me by my name and stard referring to me as bhaiya.\n\nNow even if she proceeds to file a rape case against me, which i never did, i have her confession. Each and every questions that i found important, i asked her. We have met once since and she did called me bhaiya. Am i out of danger, right?",

So I live in a reputed society of Ahmedabad, Gujarat and a lady was sitting in her car right in front of the gate blocking any vehicles to move in or out. As windows were closed I signaled her to adjust car to let vehicles in and out. She became furious and told me \"Tere jese ladko ki wajah se hi R\\*\\*e hote hai\". As soon as she said this, I was shocked and I started recording video in my phone for self defense and in that video it is seen that that lady is pushing my hand. I did not circulate that video to anyone and was solely for the purpose of self defense. Her husband then came with a bouncer and was threatening me to beat and yelling and I confronted him saying let us call the police and then both the lady and her husband were silent and didn't cared to call police. I am just traumatized after this incident that how a lady knowing all the fears of such horrific incidents happening in country can casually say something like this to me(23M). She had a son too of my age! No offense to any ladies out there, I have mother and a sister too and I respect all ladies but accusing men with such words and men can't even record video for self defense just because she is a woman?!",

He has completely lost his mind and is currently in rehab. She left home with her kids and is now living with another man. She demanded 1 crore from my uncle, which he refused, saying she betrayed the family by living with another man. After that, she filed a case of gang rape and domestic violence against my uncle. Someone from my family tried to contact her and asked her to withdraw the case, but she said she would do so only if she gets the money. The police called my uncle and asked him to visit the police station. We explained the situation to the police, and they agreed that the case is completely false and that she’s doing it for money. They advised us not to contact or talk to her. Later, an officer asked my uncle to come in the evening to discuss something. Can someone please explain what we should do next? Will my uncle go to jail just because someone filed a false rape case against him?",

        "text": "(I originally posted this on r/India as I was new to reddit stuff and thinks it belongs here.)\n\nOne of my first memories was 3 year old me sleeping with my dad and he putting his hands under my panties and put my tiny legs around his hips so that he could touch his dick on my vagina...it was dark and I was wide awake at night innocently wandering what my dad is doing to me and why is he hurting me...he would kiss me on the lips in the lift when we are alone while dropping me at school, and it wasn't an innocent parent-child kiss at all. I knew it was bad enough to not ask for that kiss again infront of my mom. I knew what my dad was doing to me every night while everyone are sleeping.\n\n It was happening to me almost every night till I was 10. It felt good, but kinda knew it was something bad, that's why I never told this to anyone. I didn't know it was sexual assault, I didn't even know what that meant, but somehow I got to know that what my dad was doing would get me pregnant, so I told him when my periods started, he looked embarrassed.\n\nBut then...when I was growing in to a woman at 12, he came up to my room to wake me up and slept beside me on bed and grabbed my boobs, I ran downstairs to living room as fast as I could. He did it again.. put his hands under my pants for 10 mins when i was going out to play.  Mind you my dad was a very abusive toxic guy, all of my family members are always scared of him that's why i couldn't even oppose what he was doing since I thought he'd get mad at me...but after that incidence immediately said sorry and never did it again..\n\nI told everything to my mom and brother when I was 14...but her reaction was \" we can't do anything now, since there is no proof\" SERIOUSLY?? That freaking broke me.\n\nHe's 52 y/o now. But I do see how he still looks at little girls and touch them, their innocent parents think that my dad just love kids in general. But surprisingly I was never loved as a child as normal. I actually never felt like a child my whole childhood. And I just became the silent shy girl with not much friends my whole life. I still don't have friends.\n\nOne of the room of my house is given to 2 girls for rent. A few days before.. me, my mom and my brother went to stay at my grandmother's house (mom side) for diwali... 1 girl went to her home and 1 was left alone with my dad.\n\nHe touched her,commented on how beautiful she is and wanted a wife like her, asked if she wants to go to hotel, gave her multiple missed calls in morning, asked if she wanted ice cream and did most of the communication with her while holding her hands, told she could sleep on the bed next to him if she was scared at night. grabbed her hand while she was escaping to room. That girl was scared to death...she gave rent money and left the room the next day, she called to meet me and told me everything.It gave me flashbacks and all my trauma came back and i couldn't stop crying.\n\nI warned my dad to never talk to little girls or girls my age anymore. I can't stay in this house now.. I really cant. I can do anything to get away from my dad and this house since my mom didn't take this seriously too. I just never want to see my dad again. \n\nI want him to go to jail. Can I do anything to get justice? Sure i cannot get my childhood back, but I know that my dad isn't going to stop as this has happened 3 times before and mom doesn't want to leave him as she's not sure where to go after leaving him. This just makes me so angry and i really want to take a step about this.",

On the 2nd of February this month, one of the girls in 11th standard said she and her friend needed some help with a few chapters. I told them they could come, and I would help them because their exams were approaching. But she came alone. When I asked about her friend, she said her friend was busy doing revisions for another subject. She had not focused on the subject and seemed a bit distracted. After an hour or so, she proposed to me, I was fucking confused and told her no and to focus on her studies.\n\nI only shared this incident with my girlfriend (22F). She told me its maybe just an infatuation and not to worry about it and if she continue I should tell her parents about it or I can get in some trouble. Today was her exam on my topic, and she sent me the question paper on WhatsApp. When I tried to open the chat, she sent me some inappropriate pictures of her, which she deleted after a few minutes and said she sent them by mistake. I don't think it was a mistake. Now I dont know what to do.  \nI think I have 3 options:\n\n1. tell her parents- but my fear is that her parents won't believe me, and she may manipulate them somehow. which is easy cause no girl do this kinda shit and my little reputaion is gone.\n2. stop teaching- I don't do it for money, my freelance work takes care of that, but I love teaching and doing what I do. However, it's the easiest option for me.\n3. do nothing- accept that it was a mistake and leave things as they are.\n\nAnd I didn't tell this to my girlfriend. She might do something impulsive.

We were made to sit in another room and were constantly threatened, harassed and our phones were taken. Initially the cops asked for 2.5 lakhs but after a lot of convincing they settled for ₹60k. A cop in civil clothes also accompanied us to the ATM to withdraw the money. When we returned to pay, they reduced to ₹50k. Idk what changed their mind. \n\nWe had tried all possible ways to get the amount down to ₹10-20k but they were not barging in, they were bullying and said this is not a market to bargain. Anything we said, they kept pressing and said they will jail us and we have to go to court. Luckily, they never hit or slapped any of us. My friend who was a girl, was made to sit in the car while we boys were kept in a room inside. She happened to click a photo of the police station to contact people in Mumbai but her phone was taken away later. When talking to the 3 star guy, a cop above his rank was passing by and they tried to hide us (felt weird as their only motive was probably to remove money from us since we were young)\n\nAnyways after two hours of waiting, they left us and asked not to inform anybody. There were around 20+ cops at the station. I wanted to know what options we had and was ₹50k without any receipt a valid fine (more like a bribe) to pay for 4 people?",

All we wanted was to have a good time during the weekend. We were trying to communicate with them in English because we are not familiar with the local language and all the while they didn’t say anything mire than monosyllables like “ganja”. Rest of the time they were communicating in their local language with each other not telling us anything.\nAfter four men searched our vehicle like madmen they eventually had to let us go because of not finding anything.\n\nMy request to the community is to please educate me about the legal rights of the so called border police.

I immediately called Air India customer care, and they informed me that the booking partner (Goibibo) had canceled my ticket. They advised me to contact Goibibo.\n\nAfter spending 30 minutes on Goibibo customer care, they claimed the onward flight was cancelled and that they couldn’t help. I then reached out to HDFC SmartBuy support, who also confirmed that the onward flight was cancelled but offered a full refund for it. However, they said the return flight was still valid.\n\nThis left me stranded, as I had already made non-refundable hotel bookings. With no affordable flights available at the last minute, I had to book a late-night bus to Goa. Traveling 13 hours with a 3-year-old was stressful, to say the least.\n\nAfter arriving in Goa, I checked the status of flight AI 9526. To my shock, it was not cancelled and departed on time. I have no idea why Air India misled both Goibibo and HDFC SmartBuy, and I was not notified properly.\n\nThis entire ordeal caused significant mental stress, ruined the start of our vacation, and left me questioning the reliability of all three parties involved. I’m now considering taking legal action against Air India, Goibibo, and HDFC SmartBuy.\n\nWhat legal recourse do I have in this situation? Has anyone else faced a similar issue? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n__\n\nLooking forward to hearing suggestions and guidance from the community.",

As the guy got to know the girl more(phone calls and chat), he realized that they were lied to, about her age and education. The girl's age was communicated to be 25 and that she was an undergraduate. This was on her bio-data. The guy's family called the whole deal off and want the jewelry they gave (on roka), to be returned. The girl's family is threatening of police case for sexual harassment and is in-turn asking for money for the expenses they had to bear for organizing roka (wtf even!?) \n\nI have a few questions? \n\n1) Can the police arrest a guy of false sexual allegations (without any tangible proof) just because the girl says so?  \n  \n2) What are the repercussions if the guy files the case here first?\n\n3) Best way to navigate this whole deal?",

        "text": "I come from Bihar and it's least say that women from there are treated shit. Dowry, wifebeating, medical, financial and verbal abuse, etc are hella common.\n\nI've grown up seeing women in my family easily getting beaten up for minor things both from meternal and petarnal side. It's very normalised but it would be big deal if women slaps back the husband and it'll be seen as something disrespectful. My aunt escaped the house in middle of the night and hasn't been back since 2019, she filed for divorce few years back but my uncle keeps contesting and going as far as saying infront of us that he'll kill her but won't divorce. \n\nThis man used to brutally beat her up infront of whole house, no shame and NOT A SINLGE person told him to fuck off or stopped. It suddenly becomes \"not our buisness\". I have witnessed all the these because they shamesly do it in front of the kids, pull the hair, punch the face and guts, she used to fall unconscious sometimes.\n\nOne of the other uncles have beaten his wife to the point of her getting ear surgery. But couldn't tolerate when she hit him back finally and he started crying victim, doesn't pay her much even tho she's housewife taking care of all the stuff and started giving tution to make her own money, the man is a fucking lawyer too. \n\nMy family is HIGHLY misogynistic, i feel greatful my parents are even letting me study still instead of throwing in AM. but nonetheless less mom teaches me the same thing but i refuse to ever tolerate this behaviour. I wouldn't even bother getting married soon or ever get in AM after seeing these, all these men doing 180° after marriage.\n\nThis isn't just in rural villages, i live in delhi and it's super common here among the women where i live, drunk jobless husbands fighting their wives using the most vulgar language you can come across. None of the neighbours do anything about it and now it became a normal everyday thing because everyone keeps chanting none of our buisness. These women themselves do not complain to the police i have no idea why, they say that it's normal and that they can't put cases on their husbands because it's sin or sum bullshit. Unfortunately they all are dependent as well with no good educational backgrounds to get a job.\n\nI feel so much rage seeing the unjust behaviour and these men walking consequence free. What can I do at all? Don't bother giving me the \"mind your own business\", these women are related to me and it affects my cousin sisters seeing these and growing up thinking it's normal for their husbands to beat them up. They follow staunch misogynistic religion too if you can guess it. \n\nIs there a way i can help my aunt and get my uncle in jail? She hasn't filed any domestic violence case yet just the divorce but i want her to, at least one case where the husband ends up with consequences would set a good example. I would want all of my aunts to leave their asshole husbands but that's impossible i know. ",

We were married for 2 of years before separating.  \nI filed for divorce 4 years ago when all talks of mutual separation broke down.  \nI have email/chat evidence of her being verbally and physically abusive towards me and have filed it with my petition.\n\nMy Ex, unfortunately, is a sadist who does not want to to sign the papers. The hearing is now ongoing for 4years. Her lawyer is cross examining me for the last 2 years. If he shows up for one hearing, he doesn't turn up for the next two/three hearings, until the judge gives them a final date beyond which the stage would be closed. The judge even closed the stage once because of frequent no-shows. However, they filed an application in the subsequent hearing and got the cross-examination stage reopened.\n\nEven when their lawyer is present for cross examination, his only motive is to ask irrelevant questions and waste the court's time. Even after two years, he is still asking questions about the time when my ex and I were dating. He still hasn't asked a single question about the facts and events mentioned in my petition that happened after we got married.\n\nI have spoken to many lawyers, including my own, about ways to get the process expedited. All of them tell me that there is very little that could be done as long as the ball is in the respondent's court. It is frustrating to see how slow the process is as I step into the 5th year of proceedings. On an average, each hearing is 45-days apart and her lawyer turns up to cross examine me once every 3-4 months.\n\nTalking to her is not an option as she has cut off all ties with me, my friends and my family.\n\nI'm turning to reddit because this seems to be my last option. Any legal advice on how to get out of this faster is highly appreciated.\n\nEdit\n\n1. We do not have any children\n\n2. She isn't doing this for the money. Personal vendetta is her only motive",

        "text": "Hello Reddit,\n\nI’m dealing with a very frustrating and urgent issue, and I need your advice on how to proceed. Here’s the detailed situation:\n\nOn Friday 13th December, I received an SMS from IndusInd Bank informing me that my account had been frozen for debit transactions following a complaint from the State Police. The bank stated that the freeze was due to a Rs. 60 transaction made to my shop's Google Pay UPI account by a person, which is allegedly linked to a fraud investigation.\n\nI had no way of knowing that this Rs. 60 transaction could be related to fraud. It seems like a small, insignificant amount, and I had no reason to believe it was anything suspicious. Upon contacting the bank, I learned that the freeze was requested by the cyber police, and the transaction in question was said to be the 5th layer transaction from one that was flagged as fraudulent by the police.\n\nI decided to visit the Cyber Police station here in Bhagalpur to inquire about the matter. To my surprise, the officer there informed me that the request to freeze my account came from Karauli in Rajasthan and said that they can't do anything and I need to go to Rajasthan. We then contacted the Rajasthan Cyber Cell with the help of some people in Rajasthan, and they were very cooperative and agreed to remove the freeze on my account, but they require an email from the Bhagalpur Cyber Police to proceed.\n\nNow, here’s where the problem has escalated: When we returned to the police station in Bhagalpur to have the email sent, the sub-inspector there flat-out refused to send the email. Why? Everyone knows why right? This is India. That too Bihar. The police can't just help a genuine person, without a few pieces of the paper with Gandhi's photo.\n\nI tried to persuade the Bank too, to unfreeze the account considering I am a customer for the bank for last 8 years. Should I lodge a formal complaint with the RBI Ombudsman portal? This is basically harassment at this point.\n\nHas anyone faced a similar situation? What are my options now? Is there any way to escalate this issue, perhaps to higher authorities or take legal action? How can I get the Bhagalpur Cyber Police to fulfill their role and send the email to the Rajasthan Cyber Cell?\n\n  \nEDIT: \n\nThe account was unfrozen on 24th December. We had submitted an application to the bank on 19th December 2024, enclosing all the relevant documents: 1. The concerned bill, 2. UPI transaction details, 3. GST Details. The bank raised the request with MHA to unfreeze the account, which got processed on 24th December.\n\nThank you everyone that helped by sharing their experiences and providing guidelines on how to approach this difficult situation for me and my family. We are grateful to you.",

        "text": "Dear all,\n\nI need your suggestion as to what legal recourse should I take. They never mentioned anything as such while I joined this organisation 1.2 years back. They issued a circular 5-6 months back stating the term and condition of the buy back. They are forcing employees left right and centre to buy the laptop they gave us to do company work, and if you deny, they refrain from giving one his experience certificate too. Need help as to what actions can I take to overcome this situation, I am planning to leave the organisation in a few months. \n\n\n\nEdit 1 : - I will make it very clear again! I am not trying to defame the organisation or spread hate or bad publicity for the organisation. It's with respect to a policy issue that has been creating issues for employees since there are a large number of employees who fail to earn even 20k a month in hand. \n\nI for one know this for a fact that a employee who resigned after 6 months of work to join another organisation while this policy was not implemented was not asked to buy back the laptop and his laptop is being used by another employee now while his data was transferred to some other employees of his department. I can say that with confidence that only after this policy was implemented (May 2024) the employees who are leaving are asked to pay for the laptops (Obviously with depreciation in price) so the employee who has already worked for a year is being asked to pay a sum of 65,000 rupess for the laptop after which the rest of the formalities will be completed is not cool. This is the entire issue and I came to this platform to ask the legal intellectuals to help me guide my way out or if this was a common practice, I would have understood and accepted it since it sounded illogical to me. It is a wonderful organisation which promotes ethos and young talents but this policy in particular is not appreciated. That's it. I am also reading a few hate comments and I would like to apologise if I hurt them in any sense! Thank you everyone for all your support and suggestions, and thank you for sharing your experiences with me.",

        "text": "First of all let me preface this by saying 2 things. I married down & I did not take dowry.\n\nThis is a long one so feel free to skip some parts if you like, though I urge you to read the whole thing because it's dramatic. popcorn and a drink highly recommended.\n\nIn the next paragraphs I would like to refer to my spouse as \"the girl\" from here and beyond because honestly she was never my wife to begin with. She belongs to the streets. This is my personal choice so please don't mind.\n\nMarried Mid 2022 (arranged, they contacted us through WhatsApp groups within same community). At the time of marriage I was employed in US and she was employed in India.\n\nEngagement + Marriage all happened within 10 days. Looking back, I'd say I had an unreasonable amount of confidence in my parents that they did all the back ground checks. My 2 selection criterias were that the girl should preferably be from same hometown and bonus if girl is an affectionate person.\n\n2-3 weeks post wedding, she reveals to me (after questioning) that she has a 10+ Lakhs loan that \"was\" taken by her parents in her own name few days before the engagement. She claimed to have nothing to do with it, and denied accountability in any regards to her personal loan. I get suspicious a little bit so I delved deeper into her laptop and find that her family has a history of taking loans. (car loan, home loan, personal loan, education loan, more loans to pay existing loans) and basically stretched their own budgets and took a loan in her name to get a gold article so they would seem \"well off\" in the wedding functions. After this news was shared with my parents, they were pretty upset that girl has a loan in her name especially when no dowry was ever asked, no gold demands were made, no money was asked and it was a complete fuck up on her families part that they sent her to our house hold with a negative net-worth. 0 was what I was expecting to start my life with her from. I am well earned till that point of time, I had 5+ years of work ex and was looking to start my life with her in US.\n\nBringing her to US would be a long endeavor, requiring a 2 year min wait and a green card. She was aware and consented to all this before marriage. 1 month post marriage I returned to US and started the visa processing steps and I would return to India every 4-6 months after that. In the meanwhile she was working from home, from my parents home, and sometimes from her parents home. Eventually after a couple months she decided that she likes it more at her parents home.\n\nEvery time I would come to India, whether it be for sankranthi, honeymoon (we had one after wedding and another one during valentines), birthdays, or anniversary, I would always end up in a huge fight with her. She was constantly fighting or creating rifts with my mom/dad. Watching all these misunderstandings happen while I was in US was tough so I tried to talk it out but nothing ever seemed to help. It was like walking on egg shells all the time. Nothing I did was ever enough. No matter how many expensive gifts I got, no matter how many trips I planned and paid for, no matter how much gold or jewelry and fancy sarees I got her during special occasions were ever enough. There would always be comparisons made to what \"others\" in her family example book did for their spouses. I would always find her mom and sister with her gaslighting and using one another as flying monkey's to teach me that \"more\" was expected. Each trip to India was like a 3-4L trip. I was like fine bro, that what a man's gotta do. All this shit will be over once we are actually abroad and there will be no noise to disturb us on a daily basis.\n\nFrom my understanding. She is a total penny-pincher. I have never seen her spend money once actually out of her own. I pre-assumed that maybe it's because though she switched the loan out of her name, she might still be paying a loan somewhere. I thought alright at least, though she isn't telling me, there is accountability in some way and she's cleaning her own messy financials. That is what I thought and similarly, to every one of her red flags I applied some dumbass justification or another. Let me also add here that there was no physical aspect to the relation ship because it was too painful for her when I tried to have intercourse. At first I thought it was genuine pain and respected that boundary but now I'm starting to doubt if that was ever true in the first place.\n\nAs the visa processing continued, things start getting very rough, during one of the trips I was in India. She 'hinted' that she would file some cases and she knows what to do. This was during one of the last days before I had to head back to US. Once I headed back the abuse continued just over the phone and video calls. By this point, I had started to get some severe doubts about her sanity. Started to read about Indian laws and soon realized that I have to start covering my bases. I started recording all the calls, all the the video calls, looking into her laptop disk (which I had snapshotted from earlier and it had a wealth of information about her) and started to realize that she was about to get married to someone right before she met me. The other family (guy) broke it off because they caught on to their bluff about their financial status long before I could. I procured her income statement and started journaling my feelings on a daily basis so I could look back and take a stand on how I feel the relationship overall because it was getting super confusing with all the love bombing.\n\nOn one fine day, during one of arguments she had a slip of tongue and accidentally said something that completely woke me up. She said that she felt no need to take care of my parents during old age and something along the lines of \"I am totally fine if they die\". That broke my heart to be honest and that's when I spent the next 48 hrs digging through all the data I had on her, reviewed everything one final time and took a decision. I canceled the citizen ship application by informing USCIS that I will not be proceeding with the application. I proceeded to inform my employer about resigning and they instead offered me a role in India for lower comp. I booked flight tickets for me to come back to India after 2023 ended. My plan of action at that point was, come to India, live with her for real without parents, assess on the ground level if going to US and having a life in US was even worth it and then take a call what to do next. Giving her green card just because we \"were\" married did not make sense to me because I honestly did not trust this girl. I didn't inform the girl about citizenship cancellation, nor job switching, I just went into isolation because it was sad that I was leaving my US career and I wanted to enjoy every remaining day in US to the fullest and free from the constant narc abuse, with friends, spending time in beautiful nature and scenic locations. When I stopped answering her calls, the isolation drove her crazy. She would constantly be on my ass trying to track what happened to the citizen ship application and I would always tell her that I am thinking about it that I don't know how I am going to proceed and that I don't think we have the required levels of trust and understanding.\n\nAfter a month of no contact, one fall evening, she shows up at my US address to my complete surprise. She came to US on a tourist visa which was granted because the interviewer saw that she had a pending GC application and gave her the B1/B2 based on her interview. She told the interviewer that she didn't want the GC and interviewer was like suit yourself. GC >>>> B1/B2. take B1/B2 and fuck off.\n\nOnce in US, she tried to woe me into sex immediately. I was like hold up..... first of all, we haven't talked in over 4 weeks and didn't you say it was hurting all the time we were in India? but apparently not anymore. When I tried to sit down with her 1:1 to level with her, it became sooooo clear that she was a covert narcissist. To her, I am just an object to manipulate and extract $$$ from and pay her loans. A child was meant to be used as a weapon.\n\nOnce I closed the door on the sex part because her traveling to US to spend time with me \"actually\" a three tier manipulation matrix along the lines of.... 1) get him (me) to have sex, use pregnancy as leverage to stay in US or dictate the relationship. 2) Next, if he doesn't comply, food poison him, teach him a lesson and 3) if he doesn't comply even then create a argument (which she is an expert in), file a VAWA petition and get a green card after proving domestic violence. All three plans were spotted early by me, but yes I was still food poisoned by her in the US while she was living in my rented apartment.\n\nAfter the food poisoning, I immediately went to the nearest the police and they forwarded me to get a restraining order. To file the RO, I approached a US lawyer and he's like this is going to be super expensive and even then to get a divorce, you would have to prove you are married in the first place which would give her an upper hand.... so all in all, this doesn't end well if you stay in US.\n\nSo, that's when I took that call that I must prepone my work relocation and move back to India and deal with whatever the fuck happens in India regardless of women's laws etc. because US divorce doesn't guarantee divorce in India. So I play this insane diplomatic game, act naive and say let's go back to India, get her to agree, book flights, and on the day of the departure....she flips and says I won't come.\n\nI had to call 911 and 2 officers show up, realize that she is dressed to goto airport, luggage is in the car to goto airport and she is stalling and squatting in a house that is not rented by her after it got dark out and these officers talked some sense into her and she got into the car and we go to the airport. After we checked our bags man that was a HUGE fucking sigh of relief for me.\n\nFast forward, We land in India in our hometown and I just walked out of the airport on my own and left her to deal with her luggage and her shit and didn't look back. After the food poisoning thing and realizing that she definitely would have filed VAWA petition I didn't respect this girl anymore even to make eye contact. just left the airport and never looked back\n\nNow it starts --- the actual drama starts\n\nGirl goes to her parents home, files 498A, 506, 509, DPA 3.4 few  weeks after we get to India. (me, parents, sister, BIL)\n\nI am in another city at the time so I respond to 41A notice electronically, get a lawyer and don't goto station but apply AB instead.\n\nShe thought I would come running to her and beg her to take back the case but I was firm on my position and had loads of evidence collected for divorce filing (under cruelty grounds) so I stayed in the same city and waited for bail to go through.\n\nIn a fit of narc rage, one rainy after noon, the girl, along with her parents and uncle break into my parents house in our hometown when we were not in the city. She starts living there with her parents. Tenants record the incident of the lock breaking but she proceeds to break in regardless. Cops were called and they sent some constables to come and check but she tells them stories of being the daughter in law of the house and they back off after taking peanut bribes\n\nAB is granted 3weeks later, we go back to home town and surrender to court and pay up for all the sureties. Parents then goto police station to file a formal complaint regarding break-in and not being able to access their own house. We get the house back after 2 days of police station visits but a lot of things in the house are broken, mom's gold is stolen, and most importantly a property in my name (original document) is stolen by the girl. Finally FIR is filed by my parents for trespass, damage and robbery.\n\nI filed divorce after this (on cruelty grounds)\n\nShe then waits a couple weeks and files RCR and a new curve ball allegation which is section 7C (family courts act) which my lawyer tells me is for dowry articles returning.\n\nThe 498A case which she filed implicates 5 people in total (including myself) but the actual complaint itself is very delusional. It alleges that 1 CR + dowry was given and that my parents and I used to beat the shit out of her regularly demanding additional dowry. She switches from english to local language and goes back and forth like an immature person. It contains irrelevant information that is inserted to seem more intense. But at the end of the day, it's basically a rant about her having to do chores in the house and waking up early. Dude I grew up doing chores like everyone else in the household. In US, there are no maids to depend on. You rely on family members to each take up some responsibilities depending on age when the maid goes AWOL. During COVID, I was in India and when there was no maid, I swept and mopped and helped my parents complete the cleaning. I made the bed, cooked when people were sick and supported in whatever I could. That's how my parents raised me - to be self sufficient. This girl is soo entitled that she put all this petty stuff as a complaint and added that she was harassed immensely and shouted at. She dragged my sister and brother in law in to this when they don't even live in the same city as our hometown. It's comical to read but I know it's still a serious court case. I am ready to fight everything in court. I will destroy this girl when the time comes with the evidence I have. I will prove my innocence and I will protect my family members.\n\nIf any lawyer is reading this or people here that know how this game works, please let me know what to do next that can improve my chances of surviving this situation and how to handle this 7C case. Thank you guys. Take care and godspeed.",

        "text": "Country: India, State: Bengaluru.\n\n\nMy girlfriend committed suicide on May 20 by jumping off the 10th floor of her building.\n\n\nRelationship context:\nWe'd known each other for 2 years. We were in a relationship for 9 months.\nShe had been mad suicidal for years, since before meeting me. Most of it because of her self esteem issues.\n\nShe was a twin. Her twin is the perfect orthodox conservative girl her parents would want. Whereas my girlfriend ( let's call her \"S\" ) fell in love and shit. S always thought that her parents deserved a better daughter and stuff. Mad suicidal. Very low self esteem.\n\nI kept her happy. Our relationship was healthy 100/100. She was so innocent and naive. I always took care of her. Was always there to hear her out when she was suicidal.\nShe told me plenty times that I saved her. and that, if I wasnt there.. she would've been gone long back.\nI kept her happy. I kept her alive.\n\n\n\nIncident:\n\nTwo days before she committed, her twin found out about us by peeking into her college mail ID's google photos (college mail ID logged in her laptop. auto-synced media) and she incriminated S to their mum.\nHer mum travelled from state A and reached state B (where S lives with her two roommates) the very next day.\n\nS works night shift. 6pm to 4am. The day they found out.. they shouted at her the whole day. Slutshamed her. She's the most innocent, naive, *one guy for life* kinda girl you could ever see. Her parents knew it too. But they still questioned her as if she was planning to be a whore for life. Emotional abuse.\n\nShe didnt sleep that day. Went to office by 6pm. Contacted me from office and let me know everything over gmeet call.\nThe next day morning her mum reached state B and continued the emotional abuse. They'll speak badly, make her cry, console her and make her cry again.\nS didnt sleep that day too.\n\nEvening 6pm office again. Told me everything. I helped her do her work. Told her that things will turn out alright.. and was supportive in every way. I was on gmeet call till 3:30 pm.Then I went to sleep.\n\nS hadnt slept for two days now. She missed taking her anxiety meds too as mum was home. (Parents do not know about psychiatric medication. They never trusted psychiatry. She had anxiety. Once attempted to hang herself in April. I saved her, travelled from state C to state B ( we live in different states too ) to be with her, had her consult my psychiatrist over call and got her on medication. )\n\nAfter I went to sleep by 3:45, S left office by 4. Her mum called and kept abusing her throughout the cab ride to her apartment too. At 4:30 in the morning that is.\n\nShe reached her building. Her apartment is in the 10th floor. She went to her floor. She didnt have it in her to go inside the door to face her mum, where she would be waiting with a mouthful of hurtful words.\n\nShe jumped off the 10th floor.\n\n\nHelp:\n\nI have all whatsapp, discord chats where she says how suicidal she was, how her parents never understood, how they stressed her out, and how much I saved her. How healthy our relationship was, how happy she was with me.. everything.\n\nI do not have any chat/message/recording of what she said to me the night before she suicided. It was all over gmeet call.\n\nNow I've been contacted by State B's police. Asked me to come to state B for enquiry. Because her father suspects me.\n\nHELP:  What should I know? What should I be ready with? \n\n\nNote: Her father is a big shot. He has contacts. Politicians, Police cmmissioners, etc etc. And definitely access to lawyers who could spin the story on me.\nIm a little scared and anxious.\nBecause though I know that I was 100% not responsible for her suicide..  I also know that her father's lawyers can spin the story and paint me the bad one.\n\nI need help.\n\nPlease.",

She is very disciplined and does well in her studies.\n\nInitially, she used to complain that her teacher would get angry for no reason and yell at every child in the class. One day, when I went to pick her up, I saw her teacher yelling at one of the kids. I immediately reported this to the school. That same day, I received a call from the coordinator. I told her that I would not send my daughter to school until her class was changed or the teacher was removed. She asked me to come to the school to meet her in person.\n\nWhen I went to the school, she assured me that she would address the issue but also blamed it on the fact that my daughter was still adjusting to the Indian system. She also mentioned that the teacher had been with the school for many years.\n\nFor the next few weeks, everything seemed fine, but then we started noticing behavioral changes in our daughter. She began saying sorry even when she hadn’t done anything wrong. She got scared if her nails weren’t trimmed. She became excessively anxious about completing her homework. When she fell sick, she worried that missing school would make her teacher angry.\n\nWhen my wife tried to discuss these concerns with the teacher, she dismissed them, saying that we were worrying too much and that schools in India function differently from those in the US.\n\nI feel I should do something about this school. I think others simply take their kids to different schools. But ideally this school should be penalised for harassing students. \n\nAny advice?",

At the time of taking consent and before entering the Operation theater, it was never indicated that removal of the organ may be a remote possibility. Infact, the Dr assured me even at the time of going to the OT that there was no need for the removal of organ. I can understand that during OT there could be circumstances which lead the Doctors to decide the remove but my concern is that I was not at all informed that it was removed even after the surgery and during the 3 days of post operation stay at the hospital. Infact, I only got to know about the same after 6 weeks when I fell sick again with 104 degree fever and was sent for another sonography, I was shocked to know about the fact. At that time my husband went to speak to the Doctor and she clearly denied. I fail to understand why she could not inform me and on confronting denied accepting. Secondly, she did not remove the Polyp which was clearly mentioned in the discharge summary (again I was not informed about it). It was only when I went for the second opinion to another hospital, that I got to know that Plolyp need to be surgically removed and that it could have been removed during the first surgery which for some reason Dr decided not to remove. Infact three separate doctors whom I consulted at the time both were surprised why it wasn't done. \n\nCan anything be done against the hospital \n\n1. for removal of organ without consent or informing me even afterwards and defending that it was mentioned (technical/medical terminology was mentioned which a layman cannot understand) in the discharge summary.\n\n2. Not removing polyp during the first surgery as I had to go through mental and physical pain and suffering due to the delay.  Now they charged me another 60k for the surgery to remove the Polyp.  \n\n3.Finally when I went to get the Polyp removed in October. They had asked me to get the sonography done which showed that both the ovary is present.  Subsequently when I raised, the hospital apologised and refunded the cost of sonography. \n\n4.Also, it appears some one has tried to sign my signature in the consent form and risk assessment form which I got to know recently when requested medical records from the hospital.\n\n  \nWhat is the limitation period for Medical case if filed in consumer court.",

        "text": "\nAbusive Gay husband, reveals homosexuality after two years, leaves country, police corruption, cases going on for 3 years, mediation asks to drop cases and let it go or it will take 20 years\n\n1. In a small city of India, my friend married a person.\nThe guy was working in India, immediately in a week he moved abroad without consummation . Once there he stopped communicating, would only message once a day, to order my working friend to cook, clean and serve the inlaws.10 years older Unmarried sister of the man lived in that house and was having an affair with a married man.  She was left with the in-laws and the guy’s sister also  started torturing her. The mother, father and sister’s torture was so harrowing, still my friend didn’t discuss this with her family as she had chosen this person.\n\n2. This sister was almost 40 years old and was having a boyfriend who was married to another woman. The boy’s family had only two bedrooms and this sister slept with my friend. She used to do nude video calls with this married man and disturb my friend. My friend’s husband supported his family’s torture, demanded money from my friend in order to return from abroad. She used to spend all her salary on her husband and family with nothing left for her.\n\n3. She would be woken up at 5:00am in the morning by placing two alarm clocks near her ears. After getting up she was asked to do work, then go to office, then come back and work. Everyday the unmarried sister of the guy would physically assault her and his parents as well.\n\n4. After a few months the guy returned but he had fever and red rashes all over his body. He still avoided being with my friend. He was always taking some tablets secretly. My friend was very confused.\nShe was feeling hurt that this guy is on purpose hurting her and allowing other’s to abuse her. And once again he just left abroad and started only being in touch with his family and avoided my friend. She was not allowed to go live with him. She was being treated like a maid and-not his wife. There are 100s of abusive chats on her Whatsapp\n\n5. My friend then decided to go abroad on her own. And when she did her husband physically assaulted her, and tried to kill her. Multiple times. Still out of love she lingered on, hoping he would change. He didn’t. She came back and when she went to her in-laws house she was thrown out. He didn’t bother getting her back, even though she was still trying her best. After 2 years he confessed that he is a homosexual and bipolar. So immediately her family filed a police case.\n\n6. The interesting part comes now. You’d think that she is having so much whatsapp evidence of her torture and the police had all of it. But they let him move abroad. He has absconded since 2021. He is paying his lawyers to stay out of this country. My friend is living the life of a widow because a homosexual decided to turn her life into hell.\n\n7. The lower courts also are working in the husband’s favor. Despite numerous evidence, the Police let his family be exonerated but in court they were charged with - “Hence, cognizance of the offense U/s.354, 354-A, 377, 307, 379, 323, 406, 498-A, 420, 294, 34 of I.P.C. and u/s.4 of Dowry prohibition Act is taken- There is sufficient ground to proceed against the accused persons'. “\n\n8. Even after being charged with such sections, they are bribing everyone to quash the case. Recently, the judge presiding over the case met the guy and the girl and started convincing the girl to drop the case even though she has evidence and witnesses .  But she is adamant to get justice as this msn has destroyed her life, she suffers from migraines and PTSD and is now in her late 30s.\n\n9. What would be the correct way to approach this? How to ensure justice when justice has a price and the victim is paying the maximum?\n\n\n",

Ours was an arranged marriage and they (my in-laws) didn't tell us about my brother in law having a mental health disorder called bipolar disorder. 2 years into the marriage it was revealed that my BIL has such issue that too when he had a maniac phase. Now my husband has been telling me to take care of his BIL just like how my MIL does and I have to take care of him after them as I have no choice. I retaliated by telling him as I can't give him such care, for which he simply says there's no choice. I told him I was not told before marriage about this, and he is not listening to me. I have already faced many issues in this marriage regarding my in law's relations with my parents, comments by my in-laws on my parents gifts during our marriage and many more things. I do love my husband a lot and I am committed to him in all ways, but all of this makes me suffocate in this marriage. I already have a child to take care off and now this responsibility is over whelming for me. I am not telling him nor do I want him to leave looking after  his brother at all.. but burdening me with this responsibility is what I am not ready to do. I have my own future plans too. I want to know what are my options if his stance doesn't change over this? ",

        "text": "So we are a small college where mostly people from UP, Noida and these places come. Women here come from very strict family backgrounds. Before, we could come and go as we pleased with a 8:30pm deadline. But now, they're introducing a biometric system for every time we leave college premises. A message will be sent to our parents with in and out timings. Food stalls, basic amenities are all outside campus but nearby. Every girl goes outside at least once or twice, but the biometric system means their parents tracking their every move and possibly restricting them to leave.\n\nThey always imply such rules for girls and girls seem extremely powerless every time as we have no support from college or parents and as college students most of us don't have the financial security or freedom or any sort. Boys on the other hand have 0 rules imposed on them. Forget their parents knowing one thing about what they do. They do all this in name of safety for the women but it's literally taking very basic rights we should have as adults.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nEdit: My college is extremely misogynistic and boys here they do a lot of illegal stuff, end up in hospitals, police stations etc but my college always covers up for them and keep restricting women more and more. We have never done anything even close to illegal or bad. Forget weed, smoking drinking nothing. Boys do hard drugs, break bones, knife fights, keep dangerous weapons.\n\nAll the people who've given legal advice I don't think anything can be done about it but thanks for sharing :)\n\nAll the non legal ones, like I said boys have broken the boys hostel biometric already and only they can break ours. If us girls even try we will be kicked out or have to bear heavy consequences. \n\nAlthough advices about acetone, sand, slowly breaking it, loopholes really help out a lot.\n\nThanks for he help :)",

Let's start from the beginning, so she told me that her dad forcefully has s*x with her and wouldn't listen even when she screams and tells him to stop. She said that she has told her elder sister about this and her sister just ignored the topic.. she says that if she tell this to her mom then her mom would immediately blame her for this happening since her mom is very old minded woman. I suggested that we should file a case against him but she said that even if she wanted to she cant, since her \"dad\" is the only person to earn money in her family so her family would just not be able to survive without the financial support. It's been months since she told me this and it has been eating me alive so I recently found out about reddit so here I am looking for advice... what should I do to get her out of the horrible situation she is in.. \n\nJust a point to be noted..\nWe are residing in mumbai so please provide some advice according to the situations in mumbai ",

So the company forced him to sign another bond which stated that he would have to be unemployed for 17 months.

The product was received by my mother, as I was travelling at that time. Since I was going through airport security, I had given her the OTP . I never had an adverse experience with Flipkart before, so I believed that the \"goods should be as expected\". However, I was wrong and a cheaper model was delivered (15.6\", i5, MRP: 62,999). I promptly raised a return request and Ekart came to pick it up the next day. However, on examination, the delivery boy found a speck of bubble on the screen (like an air bubble when you put a screen guard), which neither I nor the lady who had delivered the product had noticed. Ekart refused to pick up the product because they were scared that in case of an issue, the amount will be deducted from his salary.\n\nEkart and Flipkart advised to cancel the Return and raise it again based on \"Multiple issues\". I followed their advice.\n\nHowever, since the last 2 days, I have been on call with multiple Customer Care representatives, who refused to provide a resolution saying it was Open Box delivery so the onus is on me. The Ekart personnels who could vouch for my version of the problem are unavailable.\n\nI understand that everyone has their SOPs, but now I am stuck with a ~Rs 50,000 defective product which was supposed to be a birthday gift for my father who turns 61 on Oct 5.\n\nEDIT 1:\nFiled a complaint with Consumer Helpline and tweeted. But, not very hopeful. \n\nThere are 2 schools of thoughts here:\n1) Who have faced similar issues and can sympathise/empathise. \n2) Who are calling us naive dum-dums (perhaps, rightly so). \n\nTo (2) I would like to say that not every situation is black/white. There are nuances to each. The SOPs are always up for deliberation, to be made better. \n\nEDIT 2:\nBelow constructive advices were given:\n1) File with NCH - done\n2) Tweet - done\n3) Block CC charges - initiated",

        "text": "This was a 7 year long relationship, started with the intention to get married from the very beginning. We had been taking vacations and engaging in physical intimacy since the first month of this relationship. Her parents came to know of it around 3-4 years back and allowed us to date freely. Around 4 months back, both families met together and had a written agreement (known as a lagna patrika) in the presence of a priest, thereby fixing a date of marriage. We then proceeded to engage in shopping for marriage (I bought her whatever she wanted). She then moved to another city, with me reaching there about a week later to help her settle down. I rented out a 3BHK and furnished it fully, with the intention of staying together over there after marriage. After living there for almost two months, I proceeded to head back home. Within a couple of weeks of reaching home, she had a verbal arguement with me over the phone and all of a sudden returned me some of the money that I had spent for the marriage shopping and called of the marriage, blocking me and my family from everywhere (Phone, WhatsApp, Social media etc). We tried to contact their family several times, yet none of them got in touch with us. After about three months, my family went to their house to try and sort things out, but they were insulted and thrown out of their house. Her brother even threatened physical harm to my mother. The entire conversation was recorded. She then proceeded to unblock me and threatened committing suicide if I didn't stop pursuing this.\n\nI have invested a lot of time, money and effort in this relationship. Due to all of these events, I suffered a severe mental breakdown and lost a lot of social credit. She has since returned a part of the money I invested into the apartment. \n\nI would like to initiate legal proceedings against her and her family for breach of promise to marry. I have evidence of cohabitation, evidence of spending huge amounts of money and effort during our 7 year courtship. What are my options?",

        "text": "Lawyer here, currently practicing in Delhi High Court! Just wanted to share some Landmark rulings of the court on the rights of women in live in relationships in India. \nIn India, there have been several landmark judgments that have recognized and upheld the right of women in live-in relationships.\n\nHere are some of the significant judgments:\n\n1. Indra Sarma vs V.KV. Sarma (2013):\n\nThe Supreme Court of India held that a woman in a live-in relationship is entitled to maintenance from her partner under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005. The court also held that the definition of 'wife' under the Act is not limited to a legally married wife but includes a woman in a live-in relationship who has been in a relationship with a man for a significant period and is financially dependent on him.\n\n2. D. Velusamy vs D, Patchalammal (2010):\n\nThe Supreme Court held that a relationship between a man and a woman living together for a considerable period would be presumed to be a marriage if the couple had held themselves out to society as being akin to spouses. The court also observed that a live-in relationship could be considered a valid marriage if the couple had lived together for a long time and had a mutual intention to marry.\n\n3. S. Khushboo vs Kanniammal (2010):\n\nThe Madras High Court held that a woman's choice to live with a man, even if they are not married, is her personal decision, and society should not interfere in such matters. The court observed that live-in relationships are not illegal or immoral and that the stigma attached to such relationships is unwarranted.\n\n4. Payal Sharma vs. N.K. Sharma (2004):\n\nThe Delhi High Court held that a woman in a live-in relationship has the right to claim maintenance from her partner under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The court held that a woman in a live-in relationship could be considered a 'wife' for the purpose of claiming maintenance.\n\n5. Chanmuniya vs. Virendra Kumar Singh Kushwaha (2011):\n\nThe Supreme Court held that a woman in a live-in relationship for a long period would be entitled to the same rights as a legally married wife. The court observed that the nature of the relationship was not important, and the intention of the parties to treat each other as spouses was what mattered.\n\nThese landmark judgments have played a significant role in recognizing and protecting the rights of women in live-in relationships in India. The judgments have helped to reduce the stigma attached to such relationships and have provided legal recognition to the rights of women in such relationships.",

        "text": "\nWe went to the Police Station yesterday to file a complaint against the guy.  After thorough investigation by the Police, a written statement was taken from me, and the guy was asked to come down to the station. When he was called for the first time, he said he would be there within 30mins so we waited. He was called again after 45mins, and this time he said his manager would be coming instead. We waited 45mins more for his manager to come and no sign of him either. By this time the delivery guy’s phone was switched off. After waiting for 30mins more, his manager was phoned and asked to come down to which he agreed. 1more hour passed, the cops started getting pissed as both were fooling the police now by saying one of us will come in next 10-15mins and still no sign of either of them. The manager was called again as to know why he is not bringing the delivery person, his answer was that – ‘sir, he is scared’. This was the same delivery person who was confidently smiling and saying I could complain wherever I want, to whomever I want to, and nothing would happen. Where was his showy bravery now? Anyways, after making the Police unit wait for 3.5hrs they both finally arrive at the station. The delivery guy’s statement was taken. As he was giving the statement, he started addressing me as Madam. His whole demeanor had changed,from being pompous to suddenly a respectful man. The same man that disgustingly remarked on me being alone at home and wanting to know what I was doing, the same guy laughing and smiling while denying the order and enjoying the part where I still wanted the order and was asking him to stop. No right-minded delivery agent asks what you are doing inside alone just because you are late to open the door and especially after noticing that you in fact are alone. At most they will ask what took you so long, show some frustration on their face. So, it was none of this freak’s business to comment on whether I was alone or not which was just blind sided by some people here because they wanted to shift the entire blame to me and sympathize with the delivery guy. Well, guess who had the last laugh now (referring to someone saying that I harassed the guy and if he had complained against me, what would happen and who would have the last laugh) after the Police detained him and now a petty case is on his way, unless I request them not to file one. His arrogance that his misbehavior, teasing won’t be taken seriously and that too by the Police? A lesson was taught. I have also posted on twitter, emailed Amazon’s grievance officer, nodal officers, customer executive regarding the incident as told by some people. Thanks to all you people who thought that this was a genuine concern and provided your inputs on what I should do next.\n\nTo the other set of people here who said that I felt entitled cause I have money, It was not harassment, I am the one who harassed the guy, I am overreacting, ‘YTA’, I am looking for validation, I am whining, I am taking it to the next level by making it about women’s safety, I need to do this on twitter instead of reddit, I was desperate for the order, labelling as borderline classism and what not. I am just glad that I didn’t listen to your comments. And what had to be done is done by the Police. I pray for the women in all your lives and I hope a day doesn’t come in your life where some stranger that just needs to do his assigned job comes to your door and says to your sister/mom/any woman in your life- ‘pata nahi akheli kya kyakarri hai andhar’ cause they were late and also starts mocking, teasing around with the order and has no fear of consequences. I say this cause these women disappointed in you all. This man made the Police wait for 3.5hrs. Guess who is the entitled one now? And yes, like someone commented Respect goes both ways, thali dono hath se bajti hai, I agree with you. In no way he was respectful to me in the entire incident, so I gave back what I got from him.",

Because of various reasons, we had to see each other unfortunately so there is no running away from him. He used to talk random things after that and cleared it to me that we can be friends. I was not interested in that too but I didn't want to have the consequences of abruptly rejecting and blocking him so we became friends with each other.\n\nOne day I had to block him because of constant messages from his side (which I hated), asking my whereabouts when I was travelling back to hometown. I may have overreacted by blocking him out of nowhere, I could have explained him to stop bothering me for sometime but that happened, I blocked him. Now when I am in my hometown I received a call from one of my male friend claiming that the senior is in extreme rage because of me blocking him.

I wanna file a complaint right now on this issue but her dad is working abroad and he is the only source of income for her family, her mom has a lot of health issues that needs a lot of money for treatment. The only reason my friend was safe all this time was because after 9th he went abroad to work but now that ass*ole is coming to India this December and I'm afraid this time he'll do it again, not to mention this time it might be with my best friend's younger sister.\nI came to this platform because I need all the advice I can get, to keep her safe and her family together and to make that ass*ole pay at the same time. I feel nauseatic since she has said me this, I've never felt this kind of helplessness in my life, but she's too afraid to take the action herself due to the above issue, she's also from a Muslim community and that makes it even hard to proceed with what I'm doing as I'm a Christian. She is turning 18 in a couple of months and I'm too afraid to even think what's gonna happen to her after that.

Ashish reminded her that it's not her seat and he booked it in advance then the lady shouted \"Didn't you hear me dead I am not getting up, don't disturb me \" Then her passenger started barking like hell \"Stop involved personal life and Now shut up and go\"\nAshish didn't get a chance to explain to the air hostess. The air hostess asked to get away, and when he explained that it was his seat. The hostess didn't say a word and continued to push toward the back.\nHe repeatedly asked, shouting that it was his seat. Who was she(the lady 40 W) to tell him what to do? Now, one listened to him, and everyone just said. I wanted to help but I also lost hope. After the flight takeoff, the lady passed near me, and Ashish was beside me. She just smiled a little and said, \"Waste fellows\".\nIf this happened to me what can I do \n1) what to do with a passenger and a hostess does nothing? What can he do?\n2) where can I complain against her and the air hostess \n3) What can I do if similar things happen on a train where the passenger has taken all the space under the seat and is disrespecting me ",

My father on listening all these details got really anxious and scared. My father suffers from bad anxiety.\n\nThe caller then threatened my father that his Son-in-law (my BIL) has been kidnapped by them and demanded 1.50 lakhs, to be given to him in person at some location which he didnt disclose, to get him released. He made my father swear on god to not inform family or police about it and if he attempt to inform then his son in law will be beaten brutally and future consequences will be bad for us which he didnt disclose.\n\nMy father panicked and cut his call and immediately called my BIL to know that he's safe at his workplace and no such incident happened with him. Afterwards, my father went to police station and lodged complaint regarding this.\n\nNow more than anything else, I'm worried that caller knew all the information about our family, our work and home locations. Ive an exam in 2 days and ive lost my focus and my father has been panicking alot. \n\nIdk if i need help or i just wanted to vent out but its so scary to be at receiving end of all this turmoil.",

        "text": "I bought a Samsung S24+ for Rs70k+ and exchanged old device which valued Rs12,925, including a Rs10,000 exchange bonus. First of all he said I would get a notification in the Flipkart app about my exchange, and he left, saying he had other deliveries. I got an SMS for consent for exchange which I provided. The delivery guy then called me from his personal number and asked me to pay Rs5000 Extra, even after of Rs 10000 bonus. This doesn’t make sense at all. Even in the worst case, I would only have to pay maybe ₹2.5k to ₹2.9k. Then he had the nerve to ask me to transfer ₹3,000 directly to him if I wanted the phone delivered! His exact words were \"Company ko denge toh 5000 dene padenge, mujhe 3000 do abhi kar dunga\", I refused and confronted saying that 10k was the exchange bonus to which he replied with \"3000 toh fir bhi dena hi padega na\". I was not able to record this call as I have been doing online purchase for years and this was just another delivery for me but it went other way.\n\nI asked him to come to the address and I will pay the remaining amount, but I guess till now he felt that I knew this is a scam. He tried raising a cancellation request showing that I am refusing delivery and I received an OTP for cancellation. He said \"Sir OTP aaya hoga exchange ke liye\", I said that I won't give any OTP unless he is on the address and he disconnected the call.\n\nI tried calling him back, with intention to record it on call and ask him to visit the address so that I can record him on camera, but he didn’t pick up. Later, I got a message that my order was canceled, without any OTP or approval from me. Now, I’m being refunded the amount with Rs199 less, meaning I lost ₹199 for the pickup charge due to Flipkart team’s mistake and the delivery guy's unprofessional behavior. In the end, I didn’t get my order, I lost ₹199, and I’ve had to deal with this awful service. Some reddit users suggested that I will receive this ₹199 refund too but I have not received any message till now regarding this.\n\nAnd the support guys are just cherry on top, \"Sir nothing can be done now as the order is cancelled\" LOL atleast register a complaint if I am saying so, I have to literally school a support girl to get my complaint registered.\n\nMy order was cancelled stating that the product is damaged. No OTP, no Email, just a refund message.\n\nI might have avoided a potential scam but don't know how many decent buyers fall for such scams daily. I just want to keep everyone aware on this and possibly need advise on the ways action can be taken on the delivery guy. I don't think Flipkart will take my complaints seriously but I lack any evidence to make it a strong case.\n\n  \nEdit: What I have done till now - 10+ calls to support. Posted on Twitter and Reddit. Registered complaint to social media team and normal support team. I asked the support guy twice if I will get the pickup charges refunded as its not my mistake, he said no. He had no resolution except registering a complaint, which I did.\n\nEdit 2: FK support team says they are able to see the exchange value of Rs12726, so ideally I should’ve paid only the 150-200rs difference.",

He tried to threaten him saying he will do a police complaint and tell his family about what he's doing. But he didn't react at all and said he's family will never believe he can do something like this and that he's the perfect son even had the audacity to say he's not scared of police and getting the police involved will only damage her reputation and her parents won't be able to trust her ever again. He said he had connections and you won't be able to do anything. but after some time he said he had no intention to blackmail her and just wanted to talk to her but she was rude (she definitely should be as he treated her like shit) to him and wasn't picking up the call so he sent her the pic so that she will talk to him. He said just wanna talk to her on call once and if she wants he will never contact her again. My friend talked with him on a conference call and we recorded the call as well. He said he was worried about her and just wanted to know if she's okay but did this because she was rude and wasn't picking up the call. He said he deleted the picture (which I don't believe he did) she clearly told him that she don't wanna talk to him anymore so he said he won't contact her and he want her to call him when she is done with her graduation. This is how the call ended. She don't think he will do anything but I'm not sure.\n\n\nI'm greatfull to everyone who replied to this post.",

My uncle (my sister's father and my paternal uncle) called my grandfather's friend's son, who is a sub-inspector in the police. I don't know if bribe was involved, but the sub-inspector said even if you break his head, we'll handle it. Seven of my family members (all were male), went to that shop, along with the sub-inspector. They took my sister with them. This happened around 12pm today.\n\nThe guy is of different religion. I honestly didn't know this would take a religious turn because they went to the shop and started beating him up. Just with their hands, no weapons were involved. Now the inspector says we need to cover this up and threatened the shopkeeper that if his name comes out, his shop will be shut down. He didn't say anything at that moment and just nodded in agreement.\n\nBut now, this has become a religious issue. I don't know if he called his relatives or friends, but he has threatened us, and now the matter has taken a religious turn. We are going to file an FIR, my uncle and some other family members are at the police station right now. I really don't know what's going to happen.\n\nMy sister is leaving here in a few days after her semester break ends. She will be safer at her college, and she will stay with our relatives there until this matter is completely resolved. But now, I don't know what will happen next.

Upon arrival, I discovered that the company operates in the stock market sector, providing services to clients such as stock market tips and advice, particularly in options trading. My interest in the finance field, especially in the stock market, made me intrigued by the role. \n\nDuring the interview, I wasn't asked any technical questions. The interviewer only inquired about why I wanted to join the company. I am aware that providing stock market tips without proper registration is illegal, and in order to give financial advisory services, a company must be registered with SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India). When I asked if the firm was registered with SEBI, they confirmed that it was not, despite the company having operated for over four years. I questioned them further, asking why they hadn't registered with SEBI if they had been operating for that long, and what would happen if a client incurred losses and reported the firm. The interviewer nervously responded that their operations were completely legal, and they were confident no one would report them.\n\nAfter that, the interview ended, and I was asked to leave with a promise that they would inform me if I was selected. Once I got home, I messaged the HR department, and they informed me that I was not selected for the job.\n\nDuring my time there, I noticed some peculiar things. I saw a group of employees, mostly girls, rehearsing scripts designed to attract new clients. They had a detailed sheet of questions and answers. The building's exterior looked completely rundown, almost abandoned, but the interior was lavish, resembling a five-star restaurant. Surprisingly, even though the company deals in stock market services, there were no signs or banners indicating its name or industry. Instead, the walls were covered with matrimony slogans featuring pictures of couples, which left me quite puzzled. \n\nOverall, the entire experience felt strange and raised several red flags about the legitimacy of the company\n\nI took screenshot of the job posting from workindia and also reported them.

When I told this to my parents - my dad constantly warns us that  he'll commit suicide and tries to provoke us even in very small matters. This problem only arose because my girlfriend's caste is not as same as me. We already had a lot of heated discussions and calm discussions - all stop when he starts mentioning suicide. He creates a web of lies just to create any narrative that casts me in a negative light to my friends and family.\n\nHe has already blackmailed me and my gf multiple times - violence, mental harassment, police action and what not. What can I do in this case? Is there a way this can still be dealt with amicably?",

Her parents forced her into the arranged marriage, and she didn't confess about her past until after the wedding. She showed little interest in household activities and seemed disconnected. When my brother asked to borrow her phone to make a call, she refused, citing it was her personal phone. This raised suspicions.\n\nUpon investigation, her phone revealed evidence of her infidelity, including chats and messages. Furthermore, bank statements proved that she has a nearly 8-figure bank balance, demonstrating her financial independence. Despite this, she's seeking alimony and monthly maintenance.\n\nWe've submitted these evidence, including social media chats and bank statements, to the court, but the case still favors her. It seems the Indian judicial system prioritizes the woman's claims, regardless of evidence.\n\nThe woman has also filed a counter-complaint, alleging that my brother's mother tortured her. They've appealed to a higher court, but haven't received a response yet. My brother's family has endured years of emotional and financial pain. I'm seeking advice from a good lawyer to help them.",

Have tried asking my network for favour. \n\nTLDR : don't know husband salary and husband denying even child support to the daughter. Can we get salary details in any way?\n\nEDIT - it took her 4-5 hospital visits, she is on depression meds and therapy for last 2 years, and living in an abusive marriage for 7 years to even consider seperating for sake of health. Northern part of india is still backword and don't want a girl child.i know some of the friend's family where women are beaten to death and still they are living for the sake of child because they are financially dependent on husband.\n\nWish I could upload pictures of beatings, reports of hospitals to even stop this money extortion debate, but i know it won't mattey. The father simply denied the money for the child saying his salary is less. We willing are not at all asking money for wife. I have been paying from my salary for last 6 month for child education and rent.\n\nImagine you ask your father to pay for your college educcation and he simply denies and says ask your mother. And if you ask for your rights as a legitimate child of your father, you are blamed with extorting money.\n\nAND YES CHILD SUPPORT DEPENDS ON HUSBAND SALARY AND STANDARD OF LIVING BECAUSE A CHILD CAN BE PUT IN GOVT SCHOOL , EAT MID DAY MEAL AND FREE RATION FOOD AND LIVE IN A VILLAGE. SO FATHER SHOULD NOT GIVE ANY MONEY AND SIMPLY GET MARRIED AGAIN AND SENT NEW BABIES TO BEST SCHOOL, PRIVATE COACHING AND FORIEGN TRIPS YEARLY.\n\n\nNOW I UNDERSTOOD WHY DIVORCE IS A TABOO FOR WOMEN.\n\nI HAVE GOT KIND WORDS AND ADVICES.

        "title": "Insurance Company dropped a bombshell on me! Am I fucked?",
        "text": "Hi, \nI am a 35 year old working professional and I have a medical insurance policy from New India Assurance for a cover of 15 lacs. I have had this policy for 20 years, give or take. \n\nI had a medical condition which required surgical intervention back in February this year. I happened to find a surgeon (on a subreddit for the very same condition I had, ironically) so I decided to go visit. I really liked him and he quoted me approximately 6-7 lakhs in total. Both for the surgeon fee and the hospital stay. Despite the seemingly high fee, I was keen on getting this done because he seemed like he was very familiar with my condition and also, I really needed to deal with this once and for all, and so I agreed. \n\nI submitted an application for a total claim of a little over 7 lakhs. The insurance TPA made me run around a LOT during their process of reimbursement, and about 2 weeks ago, they informed me that they will only be reimbursing 3 lakhs from the total claim amount. On paper, they have written my claim is “beyond the limit” for my condition. And my insurance agent on the phone tells me that the TPA spoke to other hospitals and believe I was overcharged. I have immediately raised an appeal with them to which they haven’t responded. It has been two weeks. \n\nThis is absolutely gut-wrenching and I am just not in a position to write off 4 lakhs that I paid out of pocket for. Shouldn’t I have the right to choose the doctor and hospital I feel comfortable with? My claim amount is not even half of my cover, so what is even the point of paying these premiums? I am feeling cheated, and fucked over. I am gonna fight this, but I just don’t know how. I would love whatever help I can get from this sub. Thank you!\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for taking the time out to respond in such detail. I’ll quickly respond to some of the common comments in this thread:\n- the hospital didn’t have a cashless agreement with my insurance provider but my surgeon only works out of Breach Candy. So I didn’t have a choice really. \n- I did in fact speak to my insurance agent before going ahead with the treatment. They asked for a certificate from the surgeon stating my condition and upon submitting that, they gave me the go ahead for the surgery. \n- I chose a room well within the cap on room tariff mentioned in my policy doc. \n- I was not aware that there is a cap on each kind of treatment but I am yet to read the insurance policy in detail. \n- I actually did undergo a less invasive treatment for my condition back in October. And it was a 2 month process that didn’t help at all, so this surgeon was actually my second opinion and he is definitely the best option I had available in Bombay. In fact, it has been 4 months since my surgery and I am finally healed!",

        "text": "Hi,\n\nMy wife and I have been married for a month and a half. Although we’ve loved each other for the past six years, we've been constantly fighting and making up. Her parents always get involved in our fights. Recently, during an argument, her father attacked me by slapping my face and hitting my head five times. He also verbally abused me with curse words. I didn’t fight back because they were recording the incident. When I returned to address it, they forced my wife to leave our home and moved her to a new PG.\n\nHow should I handle this?\n\n**Update:**\n\nA month ago, my wife and I had a heated argument, and her father, as usual, tried to interfere. She has a close colleague with whom she started sharing personal marital issues after our marriage. I confronted her about this and warned her not to do it again.\n\nA week ago, she went to her parents' home without informing me and stayed there for a week. When she returned, she started behaving strangely and laid out conditions for continuing our life together:\n\n1. She doesn't want to come to my mother's house because she feels unsafe and uncomfortable there.\n2. She doesn't want to contribute her earnings to our household expenses. She wants me to take care of her financially, even though I already am. She earns more than me and sends all her money to her parents.\n3. She wants the freedom to go to her parents' home anytime she likes, even if we have other plans as a couple.\n4. She wants us to visit our respective homes separately.\n\nIf I don't agree to these conditions, she threatened to leave.\n\nHer father never wanted us to be together since it’s a love marriage, and I’m not the son-in-law he wanted. He called me names like \"rascal.\" I told him that if he gave respect, I would reciprocate.\n\nSuddenly, he started attacking me, accusing me of wanting his daughter’s salary and saying she was cheating. He slapped my face and hit my head five times. My wife held him back from attacking further. I told him to step aside, acknowledging his age, and said that otherwise, I could have thrashed him.\n\nHer mother accused me of abusing my wife and wanting dowry, even though I have never taken a penny or any gifts. Her father told my wife to reject me and start packing her things.\n\nMy wife returned to me, crying, and asked if she should leave. I remained silent, and she left with her parents. Later, she called me, saying she wanted to continue our relationship because she loves me. I told her to stay with her father. She’s now asking for another chance to build our life together, but her father hasn’t apologized.\n\n\n**Update 2:**\n\nAs a Muslim, we had a religious ceremony and registered in Jamath. but have not yet legally registered our marriage due to work constraints, though we plan to do so this week.\n\nWhen my father heard about this incident, he informed my father-in-law that he would file a case against him.\n\nIn defence, my wife threatened to file charges of assault, harassment, domestic violence and dowry  case against me if any case is filed against her father.\n\nCan she legally file a case against me? I would appreciate your advice on this matter.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if there are any additional details you'd like to include or any adjustments you'd like to make.",

When I told her to be respectful and politely showed her that she was also making the same mistakes which are human errors when you're working with such large volumes, she became even more rude.\n\nFinally on Sept 19, she fired me saying that it's not working out for the business. During this time, I made business worth AUD 16,500 for her which she would be collecting over 8 weeks.\n\nShe owes me AUD 1650 plus USD 125 and has only paid me AUD 248 saying this is all she owes as commission for the first installment.\n\nShe is not responding to my messages and has now blocked me on insta so I cannot connect with her in any way.\n\nThe day she fired me, she put up a post saying I'm the 8th person she fired and I realised that she's done the same thing with two of my friends as well.\n\nShe hires people from India and Nigeria and other third world countries, treats them like dirt, speaks rudely and fires them before payday and doesn't enter into any contracts to save herself.\n\nI have tried complaining about her to fair work ombudsman but cannot do so because of a technical error in the website which I have highlighted to them.\n\nI don't know what to do about this legally as it might take a lot more time and money than what she owes me and there is no guarantee of getting it back so I am posting it here and hoping no one else falls prey to her.  \n",

I got a lot of great suggestions and I wanted to share what worked for me.\n\nThe most common advice was to beat the snot out of him. Tempting as this was, it wasn't going to solve my problem. I could even face charges for assault, or worse, a bunch of chhapris out for revenge.\n\nThe next popular advice was to file a formal complaint on [indiapost.gov.in](https://indiapost.gov.in). I almost went this route, but then I decided to give it one more shot.\n\nI went to the Police station where the verification had happened. The person whom I had met earlier was surprised at this. He suggested maybe the guy was looking for some chai-pani. After I explained the situation to him, he told me that my address is verified by the Police, and saying that it is incomplete is a pretty big claim. He called his contact in the Post Office and told him to hand me the passport the next time I'm there.\n\n**Today** \\- I received an SMS saying my passport has been dispatched again and went to the post office. This time, it is a completely different vibe. Our Hero greets me with a smile and asks me to wait while he looks for my package. Even addresses me as \"Sir\". Then he proceeds to hand me my package while politely requesting to get the address updated (he's still not convinced it's the correct address)\n\n**TLDR:** Took a lot of running, but I finally managed to get my passport.

She started to message me, and I simple played along with some basic pickup line. But this suddenly took a turn as she got pretty obsessed. She would start spamming me with msgs if I didn’t reply and started to beg for my number and instagram id. Me being a bored fool, started teasing her with lines like ‘What would we do once I give ya my insta id’ I was just tryna be be flirty n funny but I had no intention to give or take anything from her. She then one day messaged me saying I’m coming to this place and I want you to come there don’t be late, I started to find her craziness funny and replied to her saying ‘What will we do once I come there ?’. Ik I should have blocked her at tht instant but my dumbass was just too bored n was looking to fuck around. She then told me ull find out, after a while she messaged me saying I’m here and I just told her sorry I can’t come maybe later. She then got veryyy pissed and started cussing at me. Then she proceeded to threaten me to export me to the police for harrassing a minor sexually ( her acc said she was 18 ). I got scared and unmatched her on hinge, in fact I realized my stupidity and deleted my hinge acc.

        "title": "Wife asking for divorce and 65 lakh rupees after just 9 months of marriage threatening with fake dowry and dv case.",
        "text": "I originally shared my story here: https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceIndia/s/lKjSTN4I2n. One detail I did not mention is that I work in the UAE but am an Indian citizen.\n\nSince then, things have taken a serious turn for the worse. This incident began in August while I was in India, and my wife was at her home in Chhattisgarh. An argument between us escalated, and my patience ran out. Realizing the severity of the situation, I asked her to involve her parents so we could attempt to salvage the marriage.\n\nHowever, her father refused to come and instead requested a one-month cooling-off period, to which we agreed. In October, when I had returned to the UAE, she called me to discuss the next steps. I told her that the situation had deteriorated significantly between us and our families, and I felt it was best to discuss matters with both families present rather than handling it alone.\n\nFor context, she has a history of multiple relationships and admitted to me that she continued texting one of those men after our marriage. Many of her male friends were either former romantic interests or individuals who had pursued her, a fact she openly confessed.\n\nShe suggested that I come to India in two weeks, and she and her family would visit my home to discuss the matter. I agreed. However, just two days later, she called from the Indian airport, stating she was coming to the UAE instead. When I confronted her about breaking our agreement to discuss matters with our families first, she accused me of wrongdoing and made baseless allegations. Suspecting ulterior motives, I canceled her visa and told her not to come to the UAE for both our sakes. I feared that any confrontation in the UAE could have unforeseen legal consequences, especially if the police got involved.\n\nHer father then began threatening me, accusing me of abandoning her after supposedly inviting her to the UAE, which I never did. I have a full recording of that conversation, which proves I never suggested she come to the UAE.\n\nCurrent Situation\n\nRecently, her father and some relatives visited my family. The meeting quickly turned hostile, with her father accusing my parents of mistreatment. He also objected to me recording conversations with my wife, even though I only did so because she had verbally abused my mother and sister and threatened me with false cases. He further alleged that we tortured his daughter, even though she only lived with my parents for 20 days in total.\n\nAfter hours of accusations, her father stated that his daughter no longer wished to continue the marriage and demanded a divorce. We agreed and asked them to provide their compensation demands. They requested a few days to prepare a list.\n\nTwo weeks later, without any prior communication, we received a call from the police station, informing us of a complaint filed against us for dowry harassment and domestic violence. The next day, my parents and relatives went to the station, where her family reiterated the same accusations they had made at our home. The police mediated and asked her if she wanted to continue the marriage, to which she clearly said no. The police then instructed both families to decide on financial compensation.\n\nThe following day, her family demanded ₹65 lakhs as compensation. This amount included:\n\t•\tHer salary from the job she left before marriage.\n\t•\tCompensation for a job she declined after marriage because she didn’t want to work in a service-based company.\n\t•\tHer projected salary for the next year.\n\t•\tCosts for the car and fuel they used to attend these meetings.\n\t•\tExpenses for her mother’s ankle injury, which occurred months before our marriage in May.\n\nMy Concerns\n\nI do not have the means to pay such an exorbitant amount. Her family is now threatening to file an FIR and initiate legal action. They have significant influence with the police and local politicians, which puts us at a disadvantage.\n\nFriends and advisors have suggested I avoid returning to India for now. My father is a paraplegic, and my mother is his primary caregiver. If she files cases in Chhattisgarh, it will be nearly impossible for my parents to attend the hearings due to their health and mobility issues.\n\nI have recordings of our conversations, which prove the false nature of her accusations. However, I am unsure if these will be admissible as evidence in court.\n\nEmotional and Legal Struggles\n\nThis entire ordeal has left me deeply stressed. It pains me to see my parents, who have always been supportive, suffer because of this situation. I am overwhelmed by concerns about my career, my parents’ well-being, and the possibility of facing false legal cases. I swear I have never raised a hand against her, and my parents have never mistreated her in any way.\n\nI am desperate to navigate this crisis and find a way to defend myself while ensuring my family’s safety. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.\n",

        "text": "I want to share a harrowing experience my family had with Indigo Airlines at Chennai Airport today. We're in desperate need of advice or assistance, and I hope someone here can help.\n\n**Background:**\n- Our flight was scheduled for 5:10 AM.\n- We arrived at the airport at 3:00 AM, well ahead of time.\n\n**The Nightmare Begins:**\n- My father was asked to undergo a medical checkup by an Indigo airhostess, which ended up taking over an hour.\n- Due to this lengthy checkup, my family missed their initial flight.\n\n**False Hope:**\n- After returning from the medical checkup, they were provided new tickets for a 7:20 AM flight.\n- Shockingly, before this flight, they were subjected to another medical checkup, causing them to miss the flight once again.\n\n**Uncooperative Staff:**\n- The Indigo staff at Chennai Airport, specifically named Lavanya, Geeta, and Gobi Prasad, have been extremely uncooperative and refuse to communicate with us.\n- We even attempted to speak with the airport manager, who was outright rude and dismissive, stating that it's \"not his business.\"\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- My family is now stranded at Chennai Airport with no accommodation or assistance.\n- Indigo Airlines is claiming that all flights are packed and they cannot provide an alternative.\n\nWe're feeling helpless and frustrated, not knowing what to do next. Has anyone else faced such a situation with Indigo or any airline? Any advice or contacts that could help us in this dire situation would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading and your support.\n\nEdit 1 : people asking why my father was asked to do a check up at the airport \n\nMy father underwent dialysis a few days back , so he had his arm bandaged . The indigo crew saw it when we were collecting boarding passes and advised us to go do a check up even after we said that we have the written fit to fly approval from the speciality hospital and showed them the same . They only measured his BP and told us it was low ( even though he's a high pressure patient) which somehow took more than an hour . They didn't allow my sister who's a doctor herself to go with my father and took him to the company doctor's room and made him sit there for no reason at all for around 45 mins before checking his BP. This same thing happened to us both the time which led to us missing the 2nd flight as well.\n\nEdit 2 : we have received several phone calls from Indigo Airlines representatives after filing a complaint on the airsewa portal. During these calls, we were repeatedly told that my father was not fit to travel despite having the fit to fly approval from the speciality hospital. When we requested clarification or asked for the reasons behind this decision, the calls were either abruptly terminated with the claim of \"you are not audible\" or the promise that someone would follow up, which has not occurred in any case. Here's the [tweet](https://twitter.com/_pradpt/status/1700393361386168521?t=pGWT2qhp5lpKp0pem3dBMg&s=19) I had made earlier if anyone wants to RT it\n\n\nEdit 3 : Got a call with the Indigo corporate office in Gurugram, Haryana. They reiterated that my father was not fit to fly today. We asked them why they issued tickets for the 7:20 am flight and why the need for a second checkup. If he was deemed unfit at 5:10 am, it raised questions about his fitness two hours later. Moreover, we inquired about the extensive time it took for a simple blood pressure check, which lasted over an hour. When we questioned this inconsistency, they assured us of an inquiry but failed to provide satisfactory answers. Instead , they told us they can give us a ticket for tomorrow at 5:10 am for free as a \"goodwill gesture\". When I questioned how they could be certain he'd be fit tomorrow when he wasn't today and inquired about the compensation or accommodation as per the DGCA guidelines , they just told us \"our company doctor told us so, but we'll not be able to provide any compensation for the ordeal due to company policies\"",

        "text": "I am brother of a girl studing in class-8 (~age 13) whose class teacher (x khan, age- 25+) is dating her friend (madhu). He created such an aura around her, right now she is not just in love but also blinded by an imaginary utopia with him. Late night calls, confrence calls by him along with his friends, random gifting in class, meeting in lone places in school are common occurrence.\n\nHow did I know:\nRecently my sister said some profile with a girl name (ex classmate) was chating with her on Instagram for about a month. But recently when she talked her over the phone, her friend denied and said she has no Instagram account. Upon further inquiry what's happening in her class. She said about all this. My sister has already tried to make her aware and back off from relationship but she didn't fudge. \n\nHow do I proceed:\nI don't want to create any controversy which will affect her life. Best way, I want it to end without involving her or her father.\n\nOptions:\n1. Directly talk to teacher and ask him to leave her alone.\n2. Ask help from some relevant government authorities (such as child helpline etc) who can handle it and make teacher back off.\n3. Inform school management and let them handle. (In this if her father got involved her life is destroyed)\n4. Inform her father (huge consequence and things can get out of control, dangerous for both girl and teacher)\n\nPlease help me and suggest me any relevant authorities whom I can contact.\n\nUpdate 1: Talked to her brother over phone. He is going to talk with father and short the matter out.\n\nUpdate 2: Teacher is suspended from school.. (his insta story: Pta h school se nikalne ka reason diya hai ki ladki se baat karte isme v ek hi ladki ka sath wo v class 8 ki):- I don't know with how many girls he wanted to talk to qualify for suspension.\n\nApart from this her father made her drop the school and beat her up.. which I personally didn't want.. hopefully once things cools, I will persuade him to let her continue schooling..",

For the past 2-3 years, my wife has been cheating on me.All this happened when I used to leave for work and she lived alone here in India. She used to give my mom sleeping pills, and then her partner used to come to my house. This was revealed to me when a neighbour (a friend) sent me a video asking, \"Do you know this guy?\"He frequently comes to your house\". I was broken into pieces. I began looking for evidence without acting emotionally.I discovered that guy's Instagram account, and my female friend assisted me in communicating with him using a fake ID. I made him confess how all this was happening, how they met, how many times they had a physical thing, and he also sent me( to the fake ID) my wife's pictures and some of her bold pics when I forced that I wanted to see her. He also confessed that my wife's plan was to kill me at some point when she would be fully satisfied. I have the screen recording of all those chats and video calls, which clearly shows his face and his voice. The whole colony is an eyewitness to him hanging around my house every night.\n\n* HELP\n\nAll I want is to get rid of her having custody of my son. The house is half in my name and half in my mother's name and that is the only asset i got. How can I protect the house, and will she seek alimony if I file for divorce? If yes, how can I escape it? It's clearly her fault, and moreover, she's ruined my life and my son's life.\n\nJust ask in the comments of you have further queries or need more info\n\nEDIT :  Thanks for the support, Gyz, even though it is virtual; it meant a lot to me. I'll begin my search for a good lawyer as you have suggested. I don't know how many men go through this situation in life because of these biassed laws. We move to other places to earn something for the betterment of our families, leaving our parents and our luxurious life behind going to bed by just having chai and bread, and this is what we get. For the women out there who support their families and are loyal to them, I have a huge respect for you ladies; you are the rarest of the rare. ",

What's worse is that this kid was transporting a package as a part of his responsibility at his job, he was actually a smart college-going lad.It's very likely that he might be acquitted of the charges, but the trial has not even started in all these years.\n\nThe NDPS Act straight out puts a bar on bail in such cases, and with how the legal system (trial court) works in this country, you could remain in jail for more than half of the maximum punishment period as an 'undertrial' person, not even a convict.\n\nThere is also this concept of 'constructive possession' where even if the narcotics aren't in your possession when you're caught, you have power and control over the narcotics and that muddies the water quite a bit.\n\nKids these days seem to be very nonchalant about drugs and narcotics, with little regard for safety or privacy. Know that a few hours of high can ruin your life for good. The legal system will ruin your life far more than any narcotics ever could.\n\nSure, a lot of people might dismiss this by saying 'don't get caught' or 'just pay off the cops', but that's just you getting lucky. Don't stake your entire future in the hands of lady luck.\n\nGood luck, everyone, stay safe.",

Broke my heart to see him being safe as always, driving over a huge bump on the road and having the fall that cost him his life and all of us, our beloved person. \n\nTo make all of this more painful, he was the only child to a single and divorced mother. He was everything to her. If there is anything I can do to make life easier for her from here on, at least financially, I would like to do that. Any advice is appreciated.\n\nEdit: it was a national highway. + he did not have term life insurance (he was only 21) and his vehicle insurance was on pause (yet to be renewed, all documents submitted).",

        "text": "Hi guys,\n\nI(38M) from Pune, rented my flat to a person who is divorcee. We later realized he is living there alone instead of with his parents which he pretended to be a permanent thing. He has kept the flat in s super dirty condition.\n\nNow our legal rent agreement ended in Nov 2024. We intend to sell the flat, this guy has kept the house in bad condition so we cannot show the flat to buyer in that condition. We have been requesting the tenant to empty the flat so they we can paint it and try to sell it. But the tenant is super rude and hameless says he will leave the flat only when he finds a sufficiently good flat. No dates nothing. We as simple people tried to send him the No broker listings, and helped him with broker too. But he is still not ready to leave. \n\nOnce we had some heated argument, he said do what you want to do. Worst part is he has kept paying rent regularly and I have no idea ho to evect the guy. \n\nNeed to evict hime asap, as we have buyers for the house, need to sell the flat as soon as possible due to financial need.\n\nI read lot of posts in this sub and others too, I realized going legal route sending notice, getting eviction notice etc will take years... Being a simple and (yes I accept this) cowrd man, I cannot just take few goons and throw him away... \n\nWhat are my chances, how can I get rid of this person? I am afraid if he files a police case against me for any reason shouldn't affect my job which is in a reputed IT firm.\n\nAny help and advice to get rid of this person asap will be helpful.",

This guy had recorded videos of her and told her if she decides to marry off she will leak her videos online and he also took her father’s number from her phone and has miss called several times to keep her scared. This guy is a local goon who has political connections and have been in jail several times in harassment cases as per details i got from ex’s friends, he has been asking her to come to visit his whenever she’s out of house forcefully , she lives far from his house and this he has been doing with several other girls.\n\nShe comes from conservative family and they will probably beat the shit out of her or probably kill her if they came to know about the videos. So she has been acting slave to this guy for almost 3 years.\nShe has a second phone on which this guy calls 24x7 and abuses the shit out of her if she doesn’t pick up his calls, so my ex has developed some sort of trauma due to which she can’t talk to people on phones, she doesn’t talk to him with also , she just shows what’s happening around her on video calls as he wants to know where she’s and she cries all day and self harm all day.\n\nShe’s afraid that police will come to her house and if she files police complaint and her character will be annihilated and he will kill her, if police doesn’t charge him and he walks free. We live in different cities and this guy carries knife and what not with him and whenever he sees some guy brother or relative with her, he warns her in public and takes her with him and beats her.\n\nThis guy doesn’t have any idea she has two phones and she used to text me with other phone as he checks her text messages, call logs etc.\n\ni want to help her but want everything to be done discreetly.\n\nCity- BBSR, Odisha\n\nNeed HELP!!!!\n",

I was a regular patient at her clinic for dental checkup and regular cleaning since 2012 to 2017.\n\nIn 2017 I asked her that I want to get the bleaching done for teeth whitening as I had very mild fluorosis on 1 tooth. She told me bleaching is not a good option and she will apply a paint on my tooth and she told me to get it done from molar to molar otherwise color will be different.\n\nI was really naive and I trusted her recommendation. When she started doing it, she started eroding my teeth which I strongly objected to and yelled to stop. But she didn't care to stop and went on to damage all my front teeth. She intentionally damaged my teeth despite knowing that she is damaging my nerves.\n\nShe misinformed me about the treatment\n, did the wrong treatment, used terrible quality material and ill-treated me when I raised an objection.Because of her misconduct, I lost all enamel and I am not able to eat. Dental bonding is not recommended for teeth whitening because it catches stain but this idiot didn’t even care about reading of a procedure and directly operated on me. I desperately tried to stop her but she didn’t even stop between a treatment.\n\nThroughout the years, I told her about her wrong doings and how much I am suffering but she refused to take any accountability. Because of her actions, I am going through severe nerve damage, monetary loss and mental trauma. When I complained about her misconduct she tried to manipulate the situation and made it look like something else. She refused to take any accountability for it. She has blocked me everywhere so I can’t expose her negligent and pathetic services.\n\nPlease suggest what should I do and how to take a legal action against her?

I wasn't even aware that the police had imposed section 144 in that area, otherwise I wouldn't even go. Some random lawyer is fighting our case and I don't even know who this guy is, I've never met him. He took up our case because he knows someone from the 18 people involved in the case\n\nIn Sept 2022, the state govt issued a gazette asking the courts to dismiss all criminal charges against those arrested during these protests. However, my case remains pending on an unready board in the district court for the past 3.8 years, we just keep getting hearing dates. I'm not even able to prove my innocence.\n\nThis year, I graduated and I've been actively looking for jobs. Even if I get hired, I'm scared a BGV might jeopardize it. The pending case will pop up, and I'll be fired/my offer will be revoked. I don't know how to deal with this problem. I'm eager to start working and provide for my family, but securing a job seems extremely challenging. Will the company even consider hiring me despite my pending legal case? How do I go forward with this? Should I proactively tell the company about my case during the interview itself or should I rely on the hope that it doesn't pop up during my BGV because I seriously need a job right now.\n\nAlso, I didn't have enough resources to hire a personal lawyer back then. I thought this issue would get resolved before I graduate but I was wrong. My hearing date is in December and I plan to hire a personal lawyer before that.\n\nI humbly request you all to guide me.\n\nPS: This is a my second account as I don't want to disclose my identity",

He canceled the wedding just a few days before the event (after all the prep and inviting people etc). This has caused a lot of grief to me and my family. If the guy would have mentioned this even a couple of months ago, it would have been fine, but the fact that he waited till the last minute to make a decision makes my blood boil. We are at a loss as to why he did this. To give some details \nThe guy works in a reputed company in US. \nHe and my sister got engaged in November of last year. We have proof of the event, pictures etc. We have the wedding card etc as proof too. Not sure what can be done here and what proofs are needed for this. \nPlease advise. \nThank you \n\nPS:\n\nFolks, I don’t want to file any false case against him. He didn’t ask for dowry, and I wouldn’t do that. But yes, there is trauma he has caused us by the way he has handled things. And I wanted him to understand that what he did is not right. \nBacking out is fine as long as it doesn’t come at a huge cost financial, emotional. I have spent close to 10L for the wedding prep. They wanted a grand engagement and we obliged. Sangeeth, done. Clothes to be given. Big wedding hall, done. No expenses were split. \n\nWe are all humans after all and playing with people’s emotions is not right. Which is what this post is for. To understand what laws are present in such scenarios and what can be done. Not to file false cases or destroy someone’s life. \nI thank anyone who has responded with any relevant information.\n✌🏾 ",

They started beating all five of us present at the scene, then they took all of us to Police station where they beat us more even my friend, who is only 17 years old, suffered a broken ankle due to the police brutality. The repairman was already present at the police station, and we showed the police the bills for the repair. The repairman then confessed to installing the stolen motherboard.\nThe police realized their mistake and apologized, saying it was a misunderstanding. However, by then, they had already beaten us severely, leaving our hands and legs swollen. We thought the ordeal was over, but it worsened when some of the police officers got drunk and started beating us again with slippers. They blamed us for not opening the gate and claimed it was our mistake.\nSome of our friends gathered outside the police station to rescue us, and the police eventually released us at 1 a.m. They told us to return the next morning at 10 a.m.\nIdk what should we do or how can we take action against them, our only mistake is that he didn't open the door.",

        "title": "M29- I was involved in a bike accident in which a pedestrian (yet unidentified) was fatally injured- looking for advice",
        "text": "Hello everyone, I will try to share my experience as a story, so that the chronology is clear. \n\nBut before that a rudimentary intro: I am working professional, staying in an Indian metro and an immigrant to the city, who doesn't know the local language. My office is about 20 Km from my residence, and every office day I get to office on my bike- a 350 cc Royal Enfield Hunter.\n\n10.30 AM: I was going from my home to the office. My office generally starts at 9 but this day I had taken permission to be late, and I was ambling to my office on my bike. \n\nThe incident occurred on the first part on the journey only, which is on a state highway with dual lanes for bidirectional one way traffic divided by dividers. \n\nAfter 3-4 Km, in a situation on the road arose that I was tailing two cars, one on the left, slower lane, and one on the right faster lane. The car on the slower lane, which was doing around 50, slowly started braking to maybe a 20-30, and seeing this, instinctively I went for an overtake of the slower vehicle on the left lane.\n\nAs soon as I had revved my bike for the overtake and got in lane to complete it, I saw that a old man, who was walking using a stick, had emerged from the front of the slowing car, at a distance of about 20 metres. I immediately honked and slammed my brakes at full, which made my tyres wobble to the point of skidding. However, as I have ABS, the brakes locked in, and at about 5-10 metres distance, the wheels start rolling again at a speed of maybe 20-30. all this while I had been honking and even screaming continuously, and though the entire episode was only 2-3 seconds long, not once did the old guy look up. Moreover, as he was leaning forward with his stick, he was casting a significantly larger projection of his body in his path.\n\nSo then the inevitable happened, I tried my level best to avoid him by swerving right aggressively, but couldn't, and slammed into the guy, albeit at and angle and a side. I flew away, and my bike dragged itself away further. \n\nAfter I got up, I saw I had minor injuries only, and people around started swarming. I ran up to the guy, and saw the guy was almost still, which made me terrified, as I had already realised this was the hardest collision I have ever had in my life, I have had only 2-3 proper collisions in my 12 years of biking, and this was the hardest.\nI was helped by another guy to pick up my bike and park it on the side to clear the road for the traffic. At this moment, i had about a 5-10 sec window where I could've run, but I first considered the fact that my bike had had a crash, I wasn't really sure about it's condition, and if i was chased down, then i would be beat up publicly. Moreover in my heart i knew that it wasn't my fault, and I was concerned for the guy too, so I decided in that moment to do things by the book.\n\nThe guy was carried to the side of the road, where it was fortunately concluded that he was alive, just that he was injured gravely, had a broken leg, bleeding on the temple, and was badly drunk, to the point he was not able to answer anything. Now I'll take a moment to describe the person, he was around 60ish, and from his appearance it was clear that he was really poor, if not a street dweller. The stick he carried was because he had already broken his other leg before, which had healed badly and was visible. The people of the locality had never seen the person ever, and he could neither provide a name or address or anything of that sort.\n\n10.45 AM: Someone from the crowd had already called 100, and an ambulance arrived. The ambulance staff got down, took a photo of my bike, and asked me to accompany the victim. The victim at this point, was drunk so much, that he had to be physically forced by the ambulance staff to stay inside the ambulance, but he could speak nothing. I tried to negotiate with the ambulance staff to take him directly to the hospital, but they insisted that as it was a accident case and 100 dial, they didn't have an option other than the PS.\n\n\n11.15 AM: The ambulance staff took us first to the nearest PS. I went into the PS, where my details were taken, and my bike key was detained from me. The police, which i got to know retrospectively, didn't register a case then, as there was no one from the victim's side. I had called some colleagues to be there to back me up.at the PS, one of my colleague's elder brother, let's call him X as he's relevant to the story, who is also a police officer at another adjoining PS, also comes to help me out. The police decree that I was responsible for the treatment, and after discussions on wether to admit him in a state hospital or private hospital, I chose the first option as it was obviously, cheaper.\n\n12.30 PM: I arrived at the hospital in the ambulance with the victim, and was soon joined by 2 other police officers. Over the rest of the day, I wheeled the stretcher around the hell that is the biggest goverment hospital in any metro, for various tests, plasters etc etc. I even assisted doctors in procedures as they had no staff, got drenched in the guy's blood even at one point during the ICT. \n\n8.00 PM: after this long cursed day, I turned back to go home at around 8. The guy's injuries were more serious than it initially looked, he had a broken rib which had caused a pleural effusion which had to be drained, and he had skill fractures, in addition to his now plastered broken leg. The guy was practically a malnutritioned street dweller and drunkard, and his body was already frail and weak, even before the accident, and this had him hard. But even now, no details to identity or address.\n\nAll this while, X was primarily guiding me and liasoning with the police for me, and was very helpful to my panicked self, telling me what to do. While returning, X told me to send him 15k, and told me that if the guy survives this would be enough, however, if not, the tab will rise.\n\n\n-Break-\n\nOver the next 3-4 days, I had to visit the hospital everyday to check up on the guy whose condition kept detoriating. As a government hospital, it is mandated that every patient is required to have an attendant (friend or family) or at least someone 24*7. As the primary contact, the hospital staff expected me to stay 24*7, which was not possible for me. To achieve this, this required a 2nd round of bribes to the police officers who were stationed at the hospital, which was relatively lesser, and not too relevant to the final outcome. All this while, there was no update on the guy's identity.\n\nYesterday 10.30 AM: I was informed that the victim had expired. I immediately went to the hospital, didn't get to see the body but the victim is gone. The hospital and I both informed the PS of the situation. The SI told me to come back home and report in the evening to the PS.\n\nIn the PS, I was accompanied by X, and 2 other colleagues and my gf to back me up. Our efforts were primarily to try that the case is not registered as there are no next of kin of the victim, and most probably won't be, as he looked like a street dweller. However, the police told me that they had to file a case as a person was dead, unnamed he may be, but if in the near future, any next of kin arrives, he would lose his job and I'll go to jail. So, as X had already talked about it, I was told to fill in all my details, including family details, on a form 41 (a)? for station bail, and signed on it. Apparently, a police person also compiled a petition in my case, but no official statement was taken from me yesterday. I was told I was free to go, my vehicle would be released after the completion of the post mortem in 2 days. X says that I need to pay some more, which is expected, but I don't know how much, and I still haven't paid him anything extra yet. But I will have to pay him soon. No details on the identity of the guy yet. This is the current situation. \n\nEpilogue\n\nSo now I'm an accused in a case under Section 304 A, and out on station bail. According to the police folks, and a few lawyers too I had a chance to speak to, as the guy has no next of kin or someone to fight for him, the case will be closed automatically after 3 hearings when and if, no one shows up from his side.\n\nIf this case goes to court, I have a photo of his initial admission report which has it clearly written that he was under the influence of alcohol. Additionally, he was on a state highway, no zebra crossings, and I wasn't going at lightning speeds beyond 90-100 or something, it was conventional speed. I think even if the case goes to trial, maybe I have a strong case. Moreover, I have a good 3rd party insurance which should cover accidental compensation if the next of kin shows up.\n\n\n\nSo now guys, you must have realised that these days have been living hell for me, and I'm too tired to decide which is the correct thing to do, so tell me, in how much trouble I am now, what should I do next, what could possibly go wrong, how to ensure nothing goes wrong, and most importantly, what next???",

Raise a formal complaint with the other party via e-mail.\n2. If that does not resolve your issue, file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (**NCH**) via 1915, Umang App, or the NCH app.\n3. NCH escalates the complaint directly to the grievance officer of the accused company, who is required to respond to the complaint within a stipulated time period.\n\nIf your dispute amount is small, i.e., around ₹10,000, filing an NCH complaint might resolve your issue and save you the trouble of going to a lawyer.\n\nIt is important to note that following the abovementioned practices will increase your chances of getting a redressal without going to court. If you do not get a redressal, the abovementioned will create a paper trail for your lawyer to add as a reference to your complaint. The same may benefit you in the court.",

I pay house rent (45k) and my wife handles cook and maid salary (8k). \n\n(Some background) Marriage has been bumpy and I feel it's due to my wife's neurotic behaviour - getting offended in every small things, shouting if things don't turn out well, always dominating. Everytime we fight she would call her parents and exaggerate the situation. Then her parents call my parents and when my parents come to alleviate the situation she would blame them that they are destroying our marriage. There is no physical abuse or monetary problems. \n\nHowever things improved somewhat and we didn't fight for 5 months straight - I would basically agree to whatever she wanted and it was going ok. But issue started when my parents came to visit. She told me if my parents come to our house she would go somewhere else as she is not ok with them. So my parents decided to stay at some other place despite being in my city and travelling here from far. But I felt it's too disrespectful and I called them to stay with us for last 2 days of them being in the city. Now she has started behaving weirdly and not talking to anyone. (Background ends)\n\nI am sick and tired of this and feel I am wasting time with this person. As a man, what are my options? I would want to stay separately ( married or not) so that I can reclaim my mental peace. Should I go for divorce first and then live separately or should I get live separately and then file for divorce? What are your thoughts? \n\n\nEdit (legal question below)-\n\nI am unsure if there is a difference - does living separately for let's say 6 months ensure swift divorce or if we immediately file for divorce will the court deny it at first and ask us to mend things? How to ensure smooth process here is the question.",

        "text": "Hi, everyone. \n\nAround a week ago, I started getting messages from different men asking if I was a certain name (and this name is a nickname some people use for me. A shortened version of my full name). When I asked how they got my number, they said it was on a \"sexy website\". Some asked for nudes, some tried to call, some asked to video chat. I managed to get one of them to send me a screenshot of where they found my number, and I was able to find the page. It's a porn video and in the comment section, it says \"Call me <my number>\" and the name of the commenter was my nickname.\n\nThe first thing I did was to write a comment under it saying anyone who's been calling the number has been getting reported to the police, so don't call it.\n\nI then wrote to the website owner asking for it to be taken down. It's been 24 hours and nothing has happened, so I wrote to Bengaluru Cyber Crime Police, Namecheap and Cloudflare.\n\nI don't want to have to change my number. I'm hoping this dies down.\n\nMy main question is, is there any possibility this could have been a bot? I don't want to think that it's someone I know. There are so many scenarios going through my head of who might have done this; from people I know to random people I've interacted with: delivery persons, taxi/auto drivers, etc.\n\nManaging to get the IP address of the person who did this would be a task as well, but is there a legal procedure through which I can do so, and is it worth the hassle?\n\nDoes anyone know of this happening to anyone else recently? Any advice/insight about what steps to take would be greatly appreciated.\n\n#**EDIT**\n\n\nThank you so much, everyone, for all your very kind messages and advice. I didn't want to think it was someone I know, and was hoping this is a new bot scam. But every single comment is telling me it most likely is someone known to me and bots don't work this way.\n\nThis information is very troubling and has disturbed me; the calls could have easily been dealt with by just changing numbers or getting the page taken down (which I have contacted the domain registrar and webhosts about). The messages have been very sporadic for a few days and hopefully will completely stop.\n\nRegarding the cyber crime police, I've been reading that it's very hard to get them to take action. I don't have the energy to follow this through (unless it escalates/is done again, in which case I will lodge another complaint at the station). I know I might not ever find out who it was, although I do have a little hunch about who it might be. Here's hoping nothing further happens. \n\nI'm also sorry about the other people this has happened to and hope you're all doing well.",

We had found the place on Instagram we decided to go for it. We had booked a camping tent, might be off season so there weren't many people there, just me and my friend and 1 more group. Since we had taken a camp we had requested the staff for hot water, one of the staff members offered us a washroom in one of the room which had showered and we agreed. When my friend went to shower, I was waiting in the lawn area for her. The guy with a smile on his face took a ladder and went behind the room, I followed him to find out that he was recording my friend through the window. When confronted he denied and immediately deleted the video, smiling infront of me, the staff at that time said that they were firing him but I guess he has been taken back. It is shameful that young staff like there was, can't seem to understand that this could happen to their daughter, sister, mother or girlfriend. I wish we had taken some extreme measures at that time, to be honest couldn't really process it. It's disheartening that even after years, the thought still haunts us, can't travel anywhere in peace. Please write review about them on Google so that others can be aware about this as well, and what are the steps which we can take now? I know it's too late but still. ",

I told him about one incident happened to me where I invested around 65 lacs rupees. And that company ran away. And didn't return my investment. And for all that I had taken loam only. \nSo my EMIs were very huge. It was getting difficult to manage. \n\nThen he told he is doing one investment from last 2 years. And that person is giving return upto 5-7% every month. I told him I can't take risks as my EMIs are already huge. If I take loans it will be very difficult. He gave me assurance don't worry. I am doing it from last two years. And he told don't worry. And if they didn't pay he will pay me. And he gave me one blank cheque as well. So I invested 3 lacs first and he was giving return regularly for 2-3 months. After that I loan instant loan option.\nAs he is from Bangalore and I wanted to start something in Bangalore.\nOne day he told me he is planning to open one franchise of one famous restaurant. I thought as he is from Bangalore. It will be good to take local support. So I thought to invest.\nSo we decided to invest 8 lacs each. \nI took money from me and he told he had given for franchise fee and shop advance.\nI agreed. And 5 lacs I given him for franchise and 3 lacs he asked for his brother. As his brother needed money. So I gave him 3 lacs for his brother.\n\nOne day he told me he got one very good deal. Where he will get upto 8% returns monthly. He again convinced me. Because of previous incidents where company ran away. I was not getting ready. I told him. Brother I am in very bad condition if something happened. My life will be ruined. He told don't worry. He is also getting cheques from the person where he invest money. I agreed and I took topup loans upto 27 lacs. \n\nAs I had I my mind that, with this money I eill able to manage previous as well as current EMIs. And I will able to save some portion of my salary.\n\nSo total amount I given him is around 38 lacs.\n\nHe gave me profit for few months. Post that he started making excuses that the person is out of station and all.\nI got suspicious as he was not doing anything about franchise as well.\nThen one day I called landlord and came to know that he hadn't given any money to him. \nAs I don't know kannada( I am from North India), he was dealing with all this. Then I came to know he hasn't given money anywhere. No franchisee fee, no rent advance. I got shock.\n\nFrom November 2023 I am keep asking money. He is saying, don't worry he will give money. But he is not giving money. He is saying that third party hasn't given him and all. \nAnd he has also told me don't worry, he has one plot he will sell and give my money back.\n\nI am keep following him. He is not giving money.\n\nHe gave one date to pay 15 lacs. Since he is not taking any action or not telling any plan. \nSo I don't think he will pay me.\n\nI am thinking to file one FIR or send him a legal notice.\nSince he has given me one blank cheque as well. So I am thinking to deposit that cheque with my amount and in case of cheque bounce I will file a court case. \n\nPlease suggest what should I do?\nFIR?\nLegal Notice?\nCheque bounce?\nOr should wait more?\n\nSorry for the long post.

She blocked him and recently, two of her friends from her hometown told her the same but never disclosed the name of the group or who send it to them. So, they were a bit concerned, but did let go of it thinking it might be someone else.\nTthis morning, a mutual friend of ours told her directly that he saw some pictures of her in a telegram group called 'Kulasthree'. Apparently the post had her photos with my friend (25M) which arent nudes but decent ones they took but never posted it in the public domain. Along with those, these is some faceless nudes and her phone number as an album of some sort. He sent her a screenshot of the same and everyone is blaming my friend, except her. They are in this together and my friend assures her 100% that the pics didn't leak from his devices and he never showed, or send those to anyone. She believes him and the news has spread in our friend circle like wildfire and the guy who sent her the screenshot directly is refusing us to share more info about the telegram group he found and he isn't saying who forwarded the pictures into the group, because the group is a small knit group with his friends from the armed forces including his superiors. \n\nI've asked them to move legally and surprisingly she's holding up well or maybe she hasnt reached her breaking point yet. But my friend is devastated since everyone is blaming him.\n\nCan someone suggest the legal procedures to address the issue, ensuring their anonymity and safety? Is there any way to not proceed through the local police station? The boomer officials will slutshame her for taking the pictures in the first place!",

It’s come to the point where we filed a case for eviction but the dude filed a counter case against us that we’re harassing him when we are absolutely not. My parents are old and tired of dealing with this. \n\nHe says absolutely false lies and false claims and the court case is dragging on for 8 months now. It’s almost as if he’s done this before and knows how to game the law system. We’re noobs because this is the first time we’re ever facing something like this. \n\nTo make things worse, the tenant whose name is on contract passed away and we were always dealing with his son who is a jerk. By the way, the contract was never signed by the other party since their first lease expired. The lawyer says, if tenant is dead, legal heirs need to provide death certificate and only then we can issue anything at all. \n\nWe really want them out asap and are really upset this is happening. Please advise. This is on Hyderabad, telangana. ",

Please suggest me some legal advice for what can happen to me and what should I do. They are not letting me give my exams without signing the affidavit which is unfair.\n\nEdit - they are not telling me to sign the affidavit but it is on the behalf of my father which states things like if school takes any action on me. My father or any family member have no right to go against them (school)  or take any legal action. But they are telling my father to sign the affidavit to let me give my exams.

        "text": "My grandfather has not been in a proper state of mind since the past two to three years. It was a gradual realisation. He lives by himself in another building in the same area and we have appointed a lady to take care of him. A tiny space (ex-store room) has been taken on rent in the same building by my family for her and her family to stay since she was recently widowed. However this woman has time and again taken advantage of my grandfather’s situation. We once found out that she had gold earrings made for her. Another instance is where some investment money (around 50k) was put in her name. When confronted she was forced to return the gold and the money. Despite this we continued her employment considering that she was desperate. Having two young college going children who had recently been rendered fatherless was obviously very sad we thus we were very empathetic towards them. In hindsight I feel that this was a bad decision.\n\nBut recently we happened to get his passbook printed only to find out that frequent transfers had been made to this maid’s daughter’s UPI id. We were shocked because he can barely use WhatsApp, forget about opening and operating any UPI account. My cousin went over and downloaded G-pay on his phone on my aunt’s instruction. She somehow got access to his account by clicking on forgot password and what not and changing the UPI pin. We then checked his transaction history. Turns out that frequent transfers had been made to the daughter’s UPI id, all of ₹ 5000 or sometimes 4 or 6k and for other things like nail salon, hair salon, spa, etc. Till now we were able to trace transactions of over ₹ 1.2 Lakhs in favour of this person. Also this is only half the story. In the passbook there had been more entries so we are guessing that these transfers were done through alternate UPI apps. We are yet to get his other two bank accounts’ transaction history which we will be doing soon.\n\nShould we approach the police directly or first confront the maid and ask her to return all the money. It’s really depressing cuz it’s sad to see your loved ones being taken for a ride like that by some absolute horrendous natured people with no gratitude whatsoever.",

Also it's not even a registered company and it's just 1 guy who is the founder. He said that he will register once he launches an MVP and it gets some users, but I am skeptical of that as well. I am thinking of leaving it, please give some advice.\n\n\\[Edit\\] Just wanted to say thanks to everyone for their advice, I have terminated my internship.",

I ended up on swiggy instamart's customer service who transferred me to another person and so on.

        "title": "A Cruel Judge",
        "text": "Hello all. This the story of my sister. She joined as process server in a civil court in andhra pradesh. Initial days the job was good and she was limited to office work, coming home by evening. Everything was going fine. The court has only one judge as it is a lowr court. Six months since joining Everything is going fine.  After 6 months, judge wife and daughter left to hyderabad for the law education of daughter. And the problems started since then. \n\nUntil then my sister was doing only office work. But after his wife and daughter left, judge started ordering her doing work at home as maid. He ordered her to cook, clean at home. My sister did it fearing his position and bad name my father carries at my hometown being drunkard and womanizer. One day he asked my sister to come with him to guntur to work at his family function,  for which she declined. From then it got even worse. One of the officer at court said to her that judge has ranted about her for not working. Saying that \"does she think herself as actress for not to work\" and few castist remarks. He started making her to stay at court even till night.  He made sure that she only leaves only after last bus to my hometown left. Know this she was leaving late at night my dad asked her if he can arrange a car for travel. She declined thinking that process server coming to court in car will only make problems worse. And judge might only allow her to leave late at night. \nDuring this time there was another officer in the court who helped her by droping home to whom she became close and thought as friend.  He is 40 plus though. I am saying this because giving half picture will not solve things. Soon rumours about their relationship started to spread. When asked my sister denied relationship but only sees him as friend. The cause for this is because the judge is making sure she leaves only after last bus left and he is the only one she can rely to get drop.\n\nSoon she got fed up with work and asked judge about this work, only for her suprise, he said that he wanted her to resign so that he can get another person whom he likes as process server. And the tourcher only got worse. He made her clean rooms and mentally abuse in such a way they she started crying all of the sudden. She wokes up from sleep due to nightmares. \n\nI was out of town for the past 6 months when this is happening and only recently got to know about all these. And my immediate reaction was asking her to resign which she complied. I want her to work hard to get another job or do pg. My parents doesn't want her to leave the job now but take LOP till judge transfers, since it is a government job. But for me i want her to leave it and find peace in another jobs. Their another idea is that she doesn't need a job and should get married.\n I am fine with any choise she makes. \n\nThe reason for this post is to ask few things \n1.aren't judges supposed to be protectors of law. How can they behave like this.\n2. Is there a way to get back to the judge legally.  My family fears retaliation from him given his position \n3. I know there are few mistakes made by sister trusting colleagues. But she isn't the kind to do something that shame her. So how cam we dispel these rumors.\nPlease help me, i am struggling with thoughts.  Your answers might help me find a solution and peace. How can i help my sister.  She is scared to doing job",

        "text": "I am a 21-year-old F, and I want to share my story to seek advice and understanding because the pain and injustice my family has endured still haunts me to this day.  \n\nBack in 2012, when I was just 8 years old and my brother was 5, my father passed away under suspicious circumstances which was very traumatizing for us. He was not a great man. He had an extramarital affair, and we suspect his death was either caused by his mistress or someone in his family. My father and grandfather never got along, and their relationship was always strained. Infact , my father wanted to live seperately  because of my grandfather as he used to create fights with my dad and always supported my uncle [chacha]. During my father's funeral ceremony , I saw my grandfather laughing , smiling and there was no sign of sorrow or grief\n\nAfter my father’s death, things became so much worse. My grandfather, grandmother, uncle, and aunt emotionally manipulated my mom into signing ppapers of the businesses that were set up by my dad , the LIC insurance money which was to be transferred to my mom. They fraudulently transferred ownership of everything that rightfully belonged to my mom, me, and my brother. They also took all the money that was ours. Once they secured ownership, they threw us out and left us to fend for ourselves.  \n\nAs if that betrayal wasn’t enough, they pressured my mom into marrying someone else. In this new household, we were mentally abused, and life just kept getting harder for all of us.  \n\nIn 2018, after years of struggle, we filed a fraud case against my grandfather for taking away what was ours. We won the case, but the process of actually getting back what belongs to us has been draining and frustrating. During the execution proceedings, my grandfather and his lawyer conveniently did not show up for most of the hearings. But when it was time for the court to make a decision, his lawyer suddenly appeared and raised objections, which delayed the case further. My mom had to change her lawyer thrice , as all of them were taking money from my grandfather to ruin the case. \n\nWhat hurts the most is that while we are still fighting to get what is rightfully ours, my grandfather and his family are out enjoying life, traveling to places like Singapore. Yet, they still cannot be present for court hearings.  \n\nIt breaks my heart to think about everything my mom, my brother, and I have been through. My mom has been our rock, handling all of this on her own since my father passed away. Despite all the manipulation and abuse, she has fought hard to protect us and continues to do so.  \n\nI wanted to share this story to shed light on what we have been through and to ask for advice on how to navigate these endless legal delays. Has anyone else experienced something similar? How do you deal with family betrayal and legal battles that seem to drag on forever?  ",

Then asked me to provide a written Complaint over this issue. There I came to know that until and unless I won't have good network I won't get justice.\n\nOne of advocate reached me out and asked for hefty fees. On which I felt so miserable to ask for justice. This is the reason no one thinks of going to officials to ask for justice.\n\nI am from Uttar Pradesh and the scammer resides in Gwalior kampoo , Madhya Pradesh.\n\nTo make it ease out for officials I have searched for his permanent address, his PAN CARD, BANK ACCOUNT DETAILS.\nHis father Name and occupation.\n\nI have each and every proof of chats, voice records and payment details with me.\n\nAs the suspect resides in some other state then how can it would impossible to get the justice.\n\nI don't know what to do now.",

        "text": "\n\nIs it only me, or is anyone else tired of being asked for their mobile number at every turn? Whether I’m buying a cup of tea or clothes at the mall, everyone seems to need my number.\n\nI’m already bombarded with spam calls and texts. How can we be sure that businesses are asking for our numbers for their promotions and not just to sell our data?\n\nHere are some scenarios I’ve faced:\n\n1. When I rejected giving my number, a staff argued that they couldn’t provide a bill without a valid number. When I suggested entering a random number, they said they couldn’t do that because they verify with an OTP. I had no choice but to cancel the purchase.\n2. In another shop, they needed to get the bill from a self-help kiosk instead billing from the counter. However, the while redirecting, the sales guy sarcastically asked, \"Won't you give your mobile number if it's a bank?\" Unfortunately, I wasn’t at a bank; I was buying clothes.\n3. The last time I was at a phone store, they opened the new phone box even before I made the purchase. When I got to the billing counter and refused to give my mobile number, they pressured me into providing it. In the end, they used their own alternate number. When they handed over the bill, they mentioned that the warranty couldn’t be claimed since I hadn’t provided my mobile number. I believe the warranty should be linked to the product and the bill, not my mobile number. As I was leaving, another guy who didn’t know what had happened asked me to fill out a form for their lucky draw, which again I politely refused. \n4. Most of the new age coffee/tea outlets ask for mobile number for billing. When asked is there any discounts.. they don't know. Then why?\n\nI mean, can’t we just pay and get the product without all this hassle?\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you also find this excessive. If so is there anything we can handle this in legal terms",

        "title": "For Those Battling False Accusations and Divorce: Trust in Karma and Stay Strong",
        "text": "I’ve seen a lot of posts lately about divorce, false accusations of dowry, domestic violence, and outrageous alimony demands. It’s heartbreaking, and it’s almost as if there’s a standard template for these situations now.\n\nTL;DR; in the end.\n\nThis post is for all the honest victims out there, enduring false accusations and battling in silence. Stay strong, be true to yourself, and trust in the laws of the universe and karma. \n\nI’m a 30-year-old man, and I got married at 27. It was a love marriage. We were the same age, and we belonged to the same caste. I ignored all the red flags during our relationship, because I was naive, in love, and, quite frankly, stupid. But she was also good at hiding behind a mask. \n\nAfter our marriage, we moved into a separate house(not with my parents). She would run to her mother’s place over the smallest quarrels with me. These fights were so minor, the kind every couple goes through. We’d had fights during our relationship phase as well—it was nothing new. But now, she’d run off to her mother’s and threaten me with divorce. If things didn’t go her way, she’d drop divorce threats and make unreasonable demands. I bought her a SUV, taken her on trips and budged to many demands due to these threats. This went on for about a year.\n\nI finally had enough. One year after our marriage, I told her to stop with the threats. This particular fight was about me paying for my parents’ medical insurance, which she didn’t want me to do. That was the last straw, and it turned out to be the last time we were a couple.\n\nA month later, she filed for divorce, accompanied by the usual criminal cases against me and my parents: domestic violence, dowry, and more. She demanded 50 lakhs in alimony and 75,000 rupees per month in maintenance. It’s almost like the lawyers have a standard template. \n\nI want to be clear—I have never raised my voice, let alone my hand, to my wife. I didn’t take a single penny as dowry. In fact, I paid for half the marriage expenses, let her freeload on my money, took her on trips, bought gifts for her family, and even pampered her with an SUV. Just for context, she earns as much as I do. And my parents were never involved, as we stayed separate. \n\nFor three years, I fought hard, running from family court to criminal court, defending myself against these baseless accusations. It was mentally, physically, and emotionally exhausting. But I’m a firm believer in karma, and I had a deep sense that “truth will triumph.” During those three years, they tried to negotiate the alimony, but I held my ground. I prayed, trusted karma, and believed that justice would prevail.\n\nAnd it did. When it came to presenting evidence, my wife and her family had nothing. They were desperate to end the cases and get a divorce, realizing that their false accusations were getting them nowhere. After three years of court battles and one year of a failed marriage, the nightmare finally ended. \n\nFour years of my life were wasted—lakhs of rupees spent on marriage expenses, pampering my freeloading ex-wife, paying lawyer fees, and enduring endless stress. But it’s over now, and I’ve come out stronger.\n\nDuring that time, I fell into depression but eventually found my way out. I focused on my mental and physical health. I began meditating, practicing yoga, embracing spirituality, and hitting the gym daily. \n\nNow, I’m happier than ever. Life is blissful. I still meditate, work out daily, and travel the world, seeking new experiences. I’m at the peak of my health—still single and happy.\n\nTo anyone going through something similar, stay strong. Be honest, trust the universe, and have faith in karma. You’ll get through this, and you’ll emerge stronger on the other side.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:** After enduring a love marriage that ended in false accusations and years of legal battles, I emerged stronger by trusting in the universe, karma, and prayer. Despite the mental, physical, and emotional toll, I now live a blissful, healthy life. Stay strong and trust that the truth will prevail.",

My mother on the other hand is extremely extroverted. And she always misconstrued my wife's introverted behavior as disrespect towards her. She misbehaved with her by bitching about my wife with me. Within 1 year of my marriage, situation evolved into a full blown altercation between the both of them. And of course since then, nothing has been the same. I never took sides and let the discontent amongst the both of them brew. For the past 5-6 months, I have told my mom in very very strict tone & harsh language that her behavior is not acceptable.\n\nI even got my mom to write an apology letter to her. In the recent months, I have been begging both my mom & my wife to give one another second chance, but nothing is moving.\n\nMy relationship has hit a rock bottom now. My mental energy is drained now. I have bad terms, with my wife as well as my mother. My wife is now taxing each and every mis-step by my family towards her.\n\nMy only recourse has been apologize to her repeatedly, but I can't take it anymore.\n\nI need to separate myself from her for my sanity. How do I go about it?\n\nupdate: I live in BLR. Mom is in Delhi NCR.\n\nUpdate: Thanks to the redditors, it has helped me re-affirm that my is completely in the wrong here. for the past few days, my mom had massively colored my thoughts about my wife & I let her do that as well. i am feeling better after engaging with all the discussions.",

He took a pantocid as he thought it was acidity. While coming home at 2:00pm he didn't want to risk it so he checked with an hospital. They did an ECG. It came out normal. The doctor told him it was just acidity. So he came home, walked the steps ( further straining his heart, mind you he thought it was acidity) and suddenly collapsed five minutes later. He died of heart attack.\n\nWe found his ecg report in his pocket and consulted a heart specialist. The ECG report showed changes which the doctor neglected. For some reason the report was normal. The heart specialist we asked said that doctors Don't usually check whether the report shows normal or not but check the frequency of heart beat printed. He also said that there is a possibility that the machine was broken. Further more we found that the doctor was not a heart specialist but a duty doctor. The hospital my dad went specialise in cardiac cases. \n\nThis is definitely a neglect on the doctors part.

Since the panel was broken it cost around 1lakh to fix it and the customer agreed for it and the panel was replaced thereby resolving the problem. Dad had done his job and carried on with his work that day. \n\nA week ago Dad got a call from the same person at 9 pm saying that the had some issues with the tv. It was election day in Karnataka and we were returning back from our hometown. The phone was connected to the Bluetooth and we all heard him speak. Dad guided him through few settings that might solve the problem but the customer said it didn’t and my dad told him that he would visit their house once he is back in Bangalore and when he comes to that area. This guy got mad for some reason and started swearing at my dad. Since it was connected to the hands free in the car we all heard it and dad immediately cut the call thinking this guy must have been drunk. He calls again after few seconds and starts swearing again and my dad lost his cool and sweared back at him as he was swearing on my mom and grandmother. Dad later cut the call. Soon after this dad started receiving calls from these unknown numbers and they were threatening dad telling that they would break his bones if he didn’t apologise. Dad cut those calls as well. But we still started receiving a few more calls and one of them told my dad that if he calls and apologises to his boss they will leave him alone or they will come to our house and deal with us ( meaning they would kill us) they asked where we lived and dad told a wrong address. Since Dad was not in the wrong he never apologised. The next day this guy came to the office and dad had already informed his manager about this. The guy accepted that he was the first to swear and that he started it they discussed it and closed it there. The company then sent the trainers to inspect the tv and there was no fault. Everything was working fine and they were satisfied. Today the manager of this guy calls and asks for my dad’s location and name (the people who created all these scene haven’t seen my dad yet in person) he told the they can come to the office tomorrow morning and that they can see the manager there but this guy says he wants to see my dad and talk to him personally. Dads manager is on leave and will be back only after 4 days. We are scared that these guys will do something to my dad. They can’t do anything to him in the office but when he is out we fear that they might do something. We have a phone recording of one of his goons threatening my dad telling that we will break my dads legs if dad doesn’t apologise to his boss. We are kind of scared and not really sure what to do. This guy is gonna come to my dads office at 10am and my dad is planning on not going fearing that something might happen. I told my dad that all of these shouldn’t scare him and that he should go to work as usual tomorrow and that everything will be fine. In case if something goes south is there anything that I can do legally? Dad asked his manager whether he should file a complaint for harassment but then his manager told not to cause this might blow out of proportion and make things worse. I am not really sure what I should do. It seems like the rich with ego can easily destroy a family. Please do let me if there is anything that I can do legally if something happens (I wish it doesn’t) 😞",

Then again i asked him to sit in the car and we dropped him 15mins after at the exact point where we picked him in front of the road cameras. i gave him the grocery along with some money and he thanked me.\n\nAlthough my friend later said i did a mistake by letting that kid sit in the car as he can accuse us of kidnapping and other things. By mom also told to not indulge in such things again as it can backfire. I realised my mistake but am really anxious and overthinking about it.

        "title": "Friend's wife eloped without divorce",
        "text": "\nMy friend entered into a marriage with a girl who was initially against the union but succumbed to societal and family pressure. Despite facing financial instability, my friend made efforts to keep his wife happy, even borrowing money and relocating to a big city to fulfill her wishes. They spent 1.5 years together until my friend fell seriously ill and was hospitalized with little hope for recovery.\n\nDuring this challenging period, his wife returned to her parental home, expressing her unwillingness to become a widow and requesting a divorce. However, my friend's mother did not give up hope and arranged for his admission to an expensive hospital. Miraculously, after a month, his health began to improve. Despite this, his wife refused to return and started accusing her in-laws of abuse and dowry demands, ultimately filing a case against my friend.\n\nAdding to the complexity of the situation, without obtaining a divorce, his wife eloped with another man whom she had maintained continuous contact with. It is evident that she had been involved with this individual while still being married to my friend.\n\nThis sequence of events showcases the challenges my friend has faced within his marriage, including the initial reluctance of his wife, his own financial struggles, and his subsequent health crisis. Furthermore, the false allegations made against him, followed by his wife's elopement, have further complicated matters.\n\nNow what legal action he should take in situation like this?\n\nEdit 1 : Thanks for all the responses. I got my answer. Elopement/cheating is not a crime and divorce is the only option \n\nEdit 2 : Let me clear few things because people are thinking my frnd is more on wrong side than girl. First thing the girl was initially asked before getting married. Her family was not in that position that they can marry her to richly Prince so they had to settle down on as per their status. And i think most of the marrieges in India happen like this only. U won't get a Prince charming coming on a horse and take u to his castle. \n\nSecondly i mentioned that my friend got seriously ill and people around are strongly doubting that she has done something(maybe mixed something in his food. That's why she was sure that she is going to be widow and came to her parental house ) but there is no proof so i do not want to drag it further. \n\nAnd lastly financially she has done more damage with her unreasonable demands. He is now debt ridden.\n\nEdit 3 : After her elopement, I received the latest update regarding the situation. The man she eloped with is described as a chapri guy, someone with a casual and carefree demeanor. Although he is currently jobless, he maintains a stylish image. It is worth noting that while this elopement is the first for the woman, the man has eloped with three other girls previously, making this his fourth elopement.",

        "text": "We are a Muslim family from Maharashtra, and I am sharing my sister’s painful story. She was married in 2020 through an arranged marriage. The groom’s family seemed educated but turned out to be extremely controlling and orthodox. From the very first day, my sister faced mental and physical abuse.\n\nHere’s what she went through:\n\n1. **No Freedom from Day One:** On the first day after her wedding, her in-laws took away her phone and sent it back to us. When she asked her husband, he told her that daughters-in-law in their house are not allowed to have phones and she should use his phone instead. To avoid arguments, my sister gave up her phone and her connection to the outside world.\n2. **Total Control Over Her Life:** Her in-laws controlled everything—what she wore, who she talked to, what she ate, even how and when she laughed.\n3. **No Respect in Her Marriage:** Her husband ignored her completely. He spent most of his time with a girl named \"Gudiya,\" who lived with the family but wasn’t related to them. Shockingly, they even shared my sister’s bed while she was forced to sleep on the floor. He avoided talking to her and came home late at night to avoid any confrontation.\n4. **Her Career Dreams Crushed:** My sister is highly qualified (MA in Geography and B.Ed) and wanted to become a professor. Her husband was also a teacher before their marriage, so we thought he would support her dreams. But after marriage, she found out he had quit his job because his mother told him to. When she tried to prepare for exams like NET/SET, her sister-in-law created drama and stopped her from studying.\n5. **No Healthcare or Basic Dignity:** If she fell sick, she was mocked for being weak. They refused to take her to the doctor unless her condition was serious.\n6. **Gold and Dowry Demands:** Her in-laws constantly praised their elder daughter-in-law for bringing dowry and gold every month. They took all the gold my sister brought with her and kept it in a bank without her consent.\n\nShe silently endured this abuse for two years before finally telling us everything. We immediately filed a domestic violence case against her in-laws and husband.\n\n**Legal Struggles**\n\nSince filing the case, her in-laws have avoided every court hearing by manipulating the police and the system. Over a year has passed, and they haven’t attended a single hearing. Meanwhile, my sister has to go to every hearing, reliving her trauma.\n\nEven when a non-bailable warrant was issued, they managed to escape. Their lawyer even got permission for them to skip court appearances. The judge handling the case seems hesitant to take any action, leaving my sister stuck.\n\nTo make things worse, during this time, her husband secretly married another woman without my sister’s consent. While he lives happily, my sister is left to deal with endless legal battles and mental pain.\n\nWe once thought of settling the matter out of court to get her a divorce, but her in-laws refused. They want to “set an example” for other daughters-in-law, showing what happens if they speak out.\n\n**We are desperate for help.** All we want is for my sister to get a divorce and move on with her life.\n\n**Questions We Need Help With:**\n\n1. How can we speed up the court process and make sure her in-laws and husband are held responsible?\n2. What legal steps can we take to secure a divorce and protect her future?\n3. How do we fight the manipulation of the police and courts by her in-laws?\n4. Can stricter action be taken against her husband for marrying another woman without her consent?\n\nPlease help us. My sister deserves a chance to live her life with dignity and hope.",

        "text": "Yesterday, between 2 and 3 AM, part of our house collapsed due to weakened wooden and iron support pillars. Thankfully, no one was harmed, but three bikes parked outside were damaged—one crushed, one dented, and one unharmed. A steel almirah was also destroyed.\n\nWe've owned this house for about 26–28 years after purchasing it from the previous owner. Over time, minor cracks appeared, but they worsened significantly in 2019 when we were away in Kolkata for my sister’s wedding. During that time, my father’s friends informed him that lights were on in a storage room (approx. 300 sq. ft.) with an entrance only from the outside. This was suspicious because we had cut off the power before leaving. A friend confirmed there was activity inside, and we later discovered that the adjacent mosque/dargah had illegally broken into the room, installed an iron door, and started using it as their own.\n\n[The Door](https://imgur.com/gallery/1kpkve0)\nOur lawyers advised us to take pictures and videos of everything happening around the house.\n\n\nThis wasn’t their first attempt at illegal possession. In the 2010s, they forged my father’s signature (in Gujarati instead of English) to claim ownership, which failed. This time, they bribed the previous owner's son and created fake documents, mainly focusing on the storage room. When we returned, we filed an FIR immediately, but the case has been dragging for nearly six years due to COVID delays and legal postponements. My father has all the proper documentation, but the mosque authorities have strong local influence. Unfortunately, friends who could testify in our favor are too afraid to get involved.\n\nThe unauthorized drilling of an entrance weakened the structure, ultimately leading to the collapse. We informed our lawyers, who advised us to file a panchnama, which we did on Saturday. Officials are expected to inspect the site on Monday.\n\nAt this point, we’re exhausted and stuck, unable to sell or move due to the ongoing illegal possession. How can we fast-track the legal process? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n[before the house fell down](https://imgur.com/gallery/uwncpWA)\n\n[After the collapse ](https://imgur.com/gallery/IpcNbIW)",

He said that I will also land up in jail if they do not send him INR 50k immideately. To this she said that we were just on call 2 hours ago and everything seemed alright. He then brought some other guy on call who started weeping and saying ki much boot mar the pain gala phasa diya hai and what not. He then proceeded to forbid her from calling me and said that he is speaking from CBI and that my phone is with \"bade sahab\" and if she calls he will put me in jail.\n\nShe immediately called dad and made him transfer 50k on the number the guy gave. But at the end the amount deducted was 1.25 lakh rupees and not 50k, I do not have the exact details how this can happen. The number he called is from Pakistan and the number he asked to transfer is a virtual network number from Denmark.\n\nI know it is very difficult to trace such people, but is there any hope of getting the money back?\n\nThanks in advance.",

It was a petty amount - something that I lose almost everyday in Options trading <insert crying gif>. \nBut everytime I saw his updates about buying a car, buying a new Husqvarna, going on trips, etc I was reminded of the small amount of money he couldn't return. \n\nThe money was not the issue. Me feeling cheated and made a fool out of was. \n\nSo the other day I randomly came across a reel where I learnt I can sue him under IPC 406. I didn't want to because it was such a low amount that the paperwork and legal fees itself would end up costing me multiple times that amount. \nNevertheless, I texted him one line \"I am suing you under IPC 406\" and radio silence in the chat from his side was finally breached. Within 15 minutes I had a barrage of texts saying \"have you lost your mind\" \"nice try\" \"who would sue someone for 3k rupees\" \"my family eats law for breakfast I'll see what you can do\" - I mean how can one eat law for breakfast but okay. \n\nI just replied him - \"I am suing everyone who has defaulted even 10₹ and refusing to pay back. Our WhatsApp chats and UPI transaction history are enough evidence. I don't care how much it ends up costing me because I have 2 Lakh to recover so any amount I get back is okay. I am anyway paying the same amount in legal fees. I just thought of texting you myself because I never wanted our friendship to come to this. Everyone else has received a call from my lawyer directly as legal notice along with a hardcopy reaching their residence. So could you please confirm your address for me as I don't want to involve police just for finding your address in order for the legal notice to reach you\"\n\nHe pleaded to give him more time but I knew he is doing the same thing again so I straightway refused to do so. I just left him on read didn't even say no. He tried calling but I didn't answer his calls. \n\nLo and behold my money was credited back to me. \n\nSo everyone, just make your lawyer friend talk to your defaulter in legal terms without threatening language, just pretending that you're trying to make sure the legal process doesn't stop.",

The risk of never seeing that money again is huge.\n\nWhat’s even more worrying is that when the pressure mounted, he started threatening to take his own life if people kept pushing him.

It all started when my mother passed away 9 years ago and she was a government servant and I was working at a top IT company at that time, my sister was doing her BTech, my father however was not so good in his business, so after my mom was passed, I was the sole earner and my mom had pending dues from her service which we supposed to get and we had a house and empty land. I work in a different city as my eductions were don there but my sister in home town. \nSo, my sister and dad were ok when I was giving them money and suddenly when my moms settlement started coming in their activities changed, they stopped telling me everything. Here are the things how it was divided:\n\n1. X cash settlement - 70% my sister took 30% for me\n2. My moms gold - Everything my sister took (it’s a lot, I don’t know how much). Except my childhood dollar which had my name shaped.\n3. I signed for my sister to take moms govt job which was coming for me, since she died during service (Still my sister didn’t get that job because she got married and all).\n4. Moms pension - when they started getting moms pension they didn’t even tell me about it and I was also giving them money, after I got to know I stopped. \n5. My dad took loan for my sisters marriage, for just giving more gold and I did my marriage with mine and my wife’s own money.\n5. My dad transferred the remaining property ownership to my name in a settlement papers, of which the land was sold for just 10 lacs (less than the direct cash what my sister got) because of an another dispute the land was half encroached. My sister created a scene when my father died how I can sell the land without telling her.\n6. So finally we have our house, no one is staying in it since my dad passed away in Covid. My sister wants share in this too, since my sisters husband is a loser staying at his parents house, I thought I will give this house to my sister if she gives 70% of the property value, as I am all already staying in my own house near my office.\n\nMy wife is fine with this plan, in fact she suggested this, but we are not ready to give any share if my sister is not ok with this plan.\nCan my sister go for legal and ask for share after I sell it, if she does I am ready to do a share of whatever we got, which will give me more. Please advice.\n\n(I want to keep the relation with my sister, but she is not a adjusting person from childhood, she wants share in everything. If the situation was other way around I wouldn’t have made such a scene, since I got enough, she eve took the property settlement papers after dad died, I thought fuck it she can’t do anything with just papers)",

He used to say things like “I’ll keep you like a queen.” “No one in the family will have the courage to point fingers at you.” \nRight from the first day of marriage, abuse started. He called my sister names(R-word, ma behen ki gali). He used to gaslight her. Within a month, my sister became a typical scared girl from bubbly girl. His parents did the same thing. \n\nI’ll give one example: \nGuy’s parents also lived with them and once my sister was ironing the clothes and by mistake one cloth got burned. My Sister’s mother-in-law made a scene out of it, started crying and her father-in-law started abusing her and her(my) parents as well. Guy on the other told to apologise to them, not just apologise, his exact words were “pairon mein gir jao mere mummy papa ke aur maafi mango” and forced her head to do the same. \n\nThis is just one instance, I could go on and write hundreds of them. There have been moments when my sister’s father-in-law has tried to hit my sister but her husband stopped him but later that night, he would say to her that she deserves it. \n\n3 months into marriage, my parents went to my sister’s place to receive her for the first time visit to maika after Marriage. They confronted the guy and his parents for the behaviour and for every allegation they had an excuse and they justified it. My mama also went with them and got the recording of the guy saying “gaaliyaan toh mujhse flow flow mein nikal jati hain” and many other things they confessed but justified somehow. \n\nNow the point is, next month there’s going to be a meeting between my family and Their family for separation/divorce and my father is adamant on getting the money that he spent on the wedding (he literally spent all his life savings). Be it mutual divorce or a court case. \n\nGiven all the facts, should we go for court case? There has been a dilemma on whether or not we should go for it. Is the struggle really worth it? Given that the marriage failed in 3 months, we have the intention of marrying my sister again as well.",

What are the legal actions that I should be taking here?\n\nInsurance is from a well known private company.\n\nOne more thing - Business was profitable and growing and factory was full of raw material so there is no reason for us to do anything shady here and we didn't have any huge loans also.\n\nEDIT - I mistakenly mentioned denying in the title instead of delaying and now can't change the title.

        "title": "Whistleblower protection for doctors in India",
        "text": "So, I'm in a bit of conundrum. \nI work in a  tertiary care private hospital in New Delhi. But since I have begun working, I have found that patient safety is the last thing they care for. There are so many concerns that I don't know where to begin. Anyways, I'll list them out here. \n\n1. The wards are staffed with incompetent nurses (mostly). They have no idea about the diagnosis of the patients, what procedures are they planned for etc. They fill up syringes with injectable medicines, for all the patients in their ward, at the same time, leave the filled syringes uncapped, on the unsanitary dias surface, without any labelling. My mind was blown by the utter disregard for high probability for medication error, and hospital acquired infection! \nNot only that, there are no sterile gloves available in the nursing station. Whenever I go to the wards and ask for sterile gloves for any procedure, they just aren't available. Also, basic drugs, even emergency drugs, like insulin, heparin, calcium gluconate, and many other drugs aren't available in the wards. Even ambu bags, laryngoscopes aren't available. Everytime I need something, they have to send someone to the pharmacy to get it. \n\n2. Documentation: The doctors are at fault here. Everytime i go to the wards to see patients, I first go through the documents. I was flabbergasted that in almost all patient's records, diagnosis and planned procedures are nowhere to be mentioned. And there is no facility for mentioning these in the electronic records either. The funny thing is, even most of the patients have no idea about their exact diagnosis and planned procedures. Also, the consent should be taken by doctors after duly explaining to the patients about their diagnosis, the procedure planned, the benefits and risks etc. Here, in this hospital, the consent is taken by the nurses. The poor patient has absolutely zero idea about what he or she is about to undergo.\n\n3. Coming to ICU, many patients are admitted to the ICU who do not need ICU care. ICU care as such is a joke. It is managed by MBBS doctors. Headed by one ad hoc critical care specialist. \n\n3. OT. There are many many basic and emergency drugs that are not available INSIDE THE OT! \nThe OT complex, having six OTs have just two ambu bags. Most OTs don't even have the emergency drugs inside the OT, rather, all drugs have to be got from the pharmacy, even in emergencies. \nMost ventilators are malfunctioning. If there's a powercut during the surgery, the ventilator gets switched off as the battery is non functional, and one has to scramble to ventilate the paralysed patient using a bag. Also, this was the first time I witnessed water leaking into the gas flowmeter of a ventilator. \nThe surgical cautery system are malfunctioning. \nThe urology surgeries are done with irrigating solution of glycine, even in cardiac patients. Nowhere have I seen glycine being used for urology surgeries. I had only read it in textbooks as obsolete for urological surgeries. \nThere are no epidural kits in the OT. The handling of the epidural catheter and system is done using bare hands both in the OT and the wards. \nSome Surgeons come two hours after induction of anaesthesia. \nAlso, there is blatant flouting of biomedical waste management. Every kind of waste goes into all coloured bins. There is no segregation at all. Same in the wards. \nPatients are accepted for elective surgeries, unoptimised, even if they have major issues. For example, hypertensive patients with BP of more than 200/100, or kids with active cough and cold. A young male had to be reintubated and kept on ventilator in ICU because they operated on the patient under ga despite having pneumonia. They just want to increase the number of cases without any regard for patient safety, and increase revenue. \nThere is no regard for maintaining sterile environment inside the OT. Visiting doctors or Surgeons don't change into scrubs, rather they just put on a gown over their personal clothes, and come inside the OT. They keep wearing their watches and bracelets, making contact with sterile drapes and new born babies. They even bring in their tote bags inside the OT, and when objected to, they just don't care. \n4. Coming to revenue, the patients are charged very very high for procedures that cost way less in other better hospitals. I couldn't believe the anaesthesia charges for a simple spinal anaesthesia, let alone all other charges. \nOh, by the way, last month, many nurses were found to have been charging patients (God knows since when), for stuff that they would have never needed. For example, pregnancy test kit for menopausal patients, hair removal cream for patients admitted just for fever, and thousands and thousands of antibiotics that the patient never got. The news has been suppressed by the management. \n\nI have video graphic and photographic evidences of some violations in medical practice. \n\nI have two main concerns. One, will the staff who are good at work, both in competence and integrity, get punished if I whistleblow? \n\nWill my career get damaged if I whistleblow on this? \n\nI have had a stellar academic background and a good career, but I wouldn't want my career to suffer. But these people, especially the management, should be brought to court. \n\nWhat should I do?",

Banged her head on multiple surfaces. \n2. Tried to punch walls. \n3. Shattered mirrors through her punch. \n4. Have threatened suicide multiple times. \n5. Would not let me sleep when she is angry would snap fingers or whisper in my ear. \n6. Tore her clothes off to ensure no one else can interfere in the fight as a power move. \n7. Sat in shower naked on the floor. \n8. Screamed at the top of her lungs on multiple occasions. \n9. Spat on my face. \n10. Slapped me multiple times. \n11. Punched me. \n12. Scratched with her nails. \n13. Completely cut me off from my social circle. \n14. She hates my dad and always complains about him as he lives with me. \n15. Verbally abused my dad. \n16. Destroying my personal property and also tried to break my office laptop twice. \n\nThere is many more things but these are big enough points for me to come to a conclusion. \n\nThere is one more part of the store. Her “happy mood”. She is in happy mood most of the time as I am completely under her control like a puppet and ensure I don’t trigger her. \n\nSo when she is indeed happy, she does take care of me. She doesn’t work and takes care of the home. Cooks, cleans and ensures I am comfortable. \n\nShe is too attached to me and extremely possessive. Even on weekends, I should spend the entire days with her on the bed next to her in the bed room. I can’t even sit in the living room. \n\nTo her, the entire life revolves around this relationship. She doesn’t have a hobby of her own. No interests. Doesn’t go out with her own friends. She has no social circle and has now implied those rules on me as well. \n\nI am finding it very difficult to tell her that I am done with this and I want to end it. I have been attending some therapy sessions and my therapist agrees that this isn’t healthy and it is highly doubtful she will ever change. \n\nWe are living in the same home which on monthly rent. Everything in the house is purchased by me with my hard earned money. \n\nThe law in my country favours women and I am not really sure how and what to do so I can get my things and also break the relationship. \n\nOne thing to note is, she isn’t from a rich background. Her dad has abandoned her mom. Her mom lives with her younger sister who is married to a rich dude who is abroad and visits twice a year. \n\nAny tips or guidance? \n\nPS: I am from India.",

So I wasn't aware about this as it was leave yesterday and I didn't check my mails. Today I get a call from HR telling me I'm terminated and I have to resign immediately. Today is my last working day, according to them.\n\nThere is a clause in my contact that states that I can be terminated immediately in case of breach of contract/insubordination/ etc.\n\nBut I haven't done any of this. I asked them if I can serve notice period or if they can share severance, but they are not willing to agree.\n\nWhat should I do? Should I resign?\n\nEdit: they're inventing reasons to terminate me such as making mistakes at work, client not happy, not being responsive on slack (it's a remote company). \n\nI missed this detail- 2-3 months ago I was given a warning letter for insubordination and I was in a performance improvement period. I passed that with flying colours and they were happy with my performance. But they didn't document that my performance has improved. Will this affect my situation?\n\nUpdate: I sent them an email with a description of all the events from my work mail. Shortly after they removed my access to the work email and removed me from all WhatsApp groups. Should I send the same email from my personal mail? As it's lost now. What should I do?",

        "text": "Hello everyone. I'm 17M living in kanpur and my cousin sister (17F) lives in Lucknow. She is my mother's cousin sister's daughter but we are extremely close. \n\nNow here's what happened-\n\nLast year she used to go to this man's house who was around 50 years of age for computer tuition. This was when she was in 10th and 16 years old. Her friend also used to go there (also female). \n\nNow, the tuition teacher is unmarried and had always behaved weirdly around her. For instance, once she told her friend that she was in the gym yesterday and her abs were starting to form and showed a pic to her. When she closed the phone he said \"Arey mujhe bhi dikha deti\" or \"I also wanted to see\". \n\nThis was when they were done with that day's class and she was waiting for her mother (my masi) to pick her up. She immediately called him out and he said that he was joking. \n\nNow flash forward to December (she is now 17), she was in his home for the classes alone and when only 5 minutes remained, she called her mother (my masi) to come pick her up. When she was about to get up, this man held her arm and forced her into a hug which lasted for an awkward 30 seconds. \n\nAs soon as he let go of the hug he grabbed her chin and moved her face towards him and kissed her on the lips. She obviously didn't kiss back and was frozen in fear and immediately got up and ran down the stairs and out of his house cuz thankfully she heard her mother's car's honk outside.\n\nWe were really thankful that this happened in the last 5 minutes when her mom was already outside otherwise god knows what else that man could have done with her.\n\nThe man later called her and said that he usually does not feel this way towards his students and she said that this can't continue and he said \"Haan lag hi rha tha\" or \"Yeah I thought so\" and hung up the phone. She left the tuition and never went again and has been dealing with trauma because of the incident. \n\nYesterday, icse announced the result and she got a really good % along with really good marks in computers. Now her parents are forcing her to go and meet the tuition teacher to tell him her result and to thank him and they will probably go with her to thank him as well.\n\nThe thing is that the parents do not know and can't know under any circumstance. She has made it clear that the aftermath would be ugly if they get to know and is not comfortable in telling them/ letting them know. She told me all this yesterday and asked for help. \n\nWhat do I do. Any help is much appreciated. Thanks a lot. ",

        "title": "My(42M) father(73) is harrassing me by demanding money all the time and that he will go to court or end his life if I don't give all the money that he wants",
        "text": "My father (73) and my mother live in the house that I, their son (42) bought ten years ago in chennai. I also provide for monthly expenses. It is on average 30k rupees but more as needed if there are ad hoc expenses or medical expenses of course. \n\nI have been providing for them partially since 2007 up until 2011. Then my father stopped contributing. He started saving whatever he earned for himself. Since then I have contributed completely for all family expenses while also getting \nmarried and taking care of my other family. \n\nI bought the house in 2013 while sitting abroad.y parents helped me purchase the property by visiting sites to finalize an apartment. I bought it all with my money. \n\n2 years ago, I brought them abroad on visitors visa and as I had purchased properties abroad, and funds were tight, I had asked my father to break one of his fixed deposits for flight money. Around 4.5 lakhs. (He saved all this money in the past decade by keeping his money for himself. He wouldn't spend a penny on the family, not even for my mother) \n\nCar:\nThey stayed with me and my family abroad for a year and then they went back home. He keeps trying to find a job at this age with no qualifications and gets himself into small level schemes like insurance agent etc. so he goes to these places in car and demands a lot more money than the money that is being sent for expenses each month. If it was just to go out for groceries, medical visits, recreation, then it would just be nominal expenses. I even advised to sell the car and use Uber for everything to avoid constant maintenance charges for the car. While going back, he promised that he would sell the car but now he isn't. He says it would be a great loss. \n\nMedical expenses:\n\nHe has extreme dermatitis and that's age related. So I provide for his medical expenses. But apart from doing allopathy, he also buys sidha/ayurveda medication and half of the medicine doesn't get used. In addition to that he also buys homeopathy tablets. So I request to just do one type of treatment so that it is effective and not waste unnecessarily. Also, even though there are dietary restrictions for his skin condition, he would take all the medications without following any dietary recommendations. He consumes oily fried snacks on a regular basis.\n\nI'm struggling here because the real estate has been too bad and the properties I purchased aren't doing well. What I earn is just enough for my family here, mortgage and to send to my parents. I can't live a luxurious life. I can't even go on vacations with my family. I can definitely provide for a comfortable life for my parents. I'm happy that I bought the house where they live. I'm happy to provide for monthly expenses and whatever more is required for medical or any adhoc purchases for example a new washing machine. But I can't afford to keep giving more and more as per my father's whim. \n\nMy mother doesn't need much and she tries to curtail expenses even and she also feels and knows that what my father asks for is too much. \n\nThe horror:\n\n\nYears ago, he sent a letter from a lawyer in a word file to my Gmail account. No stamp, no nothing demanding separate 20,000 rupees just for him every month apart from regular family expenses for him to be able to buy a car. Then that situation was somehow neutralized. That has been traumatic to me to this day. I'm addition to not getting any fatherly affection, guidance or advice in times of need, he harrases me and causes me trauma. \n\nWhat was in the letter?\nThat children in India have to support old parents else they can be legally punished. Something of that sort. That is only applicable when kids don't care at all for old parents. \n\nPeriodically since he went back to India, he has been demanding more money for his additional expenses. He threatens me to give him more money else he will kill himself. \n\nGrowing up, we didn't live lavishly and when the family asked him for something remotely extra, he would say things like \" I'm not tata birla, I can afford only this much\". \nAnd now I can afford only this much. And he has no compassion for me. \n\nAnd when I say that I already have been doing so much, he reminds me that he paid for my school fees and took care of me when I grew up. \n\nHe has been asking me 8 lakhs. This is 4.5 lakhs which he gave for the tickets to come abroad and return to India. And he has added interest amount to this money and arrived at 8 lakhs somehow. \n\nI said that I will try to arrange that 8 lakhs and give him but then he needs to move out and he won't be part of family. To which he says, I owe him 1. 5 crores( amount plus interest) for all that he has done for me since I was born till I started earning. Isn't he supposed to provide for me after having given birth to me?\n\nMoreover he also says more than 50 % of the house that I bought, that he lives in, belongs to him it seems. Because he went to various sites to help buy this apartment. And he has been living for free here. I don't even know how he formed this logic. \n\nMy mother says she should have divorced him long back but now it is too late. If we make him go out now, he will create a huge scene and it is so hard to manage thos because my poor mother is alone there and I'm abroad and there is no one to help. \n\nHe has been harassing me and my mother this way for years and the frequency and intensity has now increased. \n\n\nI applied for a PR in Canada for both of them and the application is in progress. I want to do this because I've no relatives or siblings there to take care of them in their old age. But he is not cooperating to complete the application. He doesn't want to come. Only if they both come, I can sell the house and manage my finances here. He won't allow me to sell my own house. \n\nMoreover, he doesn't want my mother to come abroad as he wants her to stay there and cook for him. \n\nI want to bring at least my mother to live with me. I care about her too much. And he is causing so much stress for her. She doesn't even want to live with him there. \n\nOne day she will also get really old, then who will cook. And he doesn't even consider that it is his duty to provide for his wife but he expects her to cook for him even though he is so passively harassing. He is so far from redemption.\n\nI don't want to waste time going to court or fight battles. I know he has nothing bad to prove about me. I take good care of my parents. But it seems like he treats me like an enemy and he has nothing to lose. I don't want to spend time getting involved with court proceedings, going to India. I have a life here abroad. \n\nPlease help me here. I'm so lost and defeated. ",

Yesterday, I got sick from an allergy and messaged HR in the morning saying I needed leave.\n\nThe harassment timeline:\n- HR demanded I work despite being sick because \"I'm WFH anyway\"\n- Kept pressuring me while I was resting, calling repeatedly\n- When I couldn't provide immediate prescription, threatened termination\n- When I suggested they could mark it LWP if medical leave was an issue, they used this against me\n- Marked my leave as LWP despite having 11 medical leaves available\n- Today, sent termination email stating they'll:\n  - Withhold entire month's salary\n  - Not provide experience letter\n  - Terminate me for \"unnecessary arguments\"\n\nAll this over ONE medical leave request when I have 11 unused leaves. Is this even legal? What steps should I take now?\n\nTLDR: Used 1 medical leave while sick, HR harassed for prescription, terminated me next day and withhold month's salary.\n\nEdited - Just want to mention I travelled last weekend from where I got sick, I took half-day on thursday and LWP on Friday. And then applied for ML on Monday which got rejected and converted to LWP, on Tuesday got Terminated.\nIf you are wondering why I needed to take LWP on Friday, it's because we don't get causal leaves for a whole year. You have to earn them 1 per month which will be updated on 1Jan of each year. ",

        "text": "I recently got to know that My wife lied about her marital status in passport. \n\nMarital Background: \n\n-We changed her surname in Aadhar card from her parents’ to mine after marriage.\n\n-Things in marriage got complicated\n\n-She filed false false 498a and dv against me and my family.\n\n-she decided to move to USA for studies (as every woman who cannot show their face in society after filing false cases).\n\n-Applied for passport at this point as she did not have passport. At this point, her Aadhar still has my surname.\n\n-She takes IELTS, applies to colleges, gets into one etc\n\n-Applied for visa\n\n-we filed for mutual divorce with the understanding that she will withdraw the case. It is mentioned in mutual divorce affidavit that she should withdraw the case.\n\n-she still hasn’t withdrawn the cases\n\n-She flies off to USA in august 2023\n\n-Now i get to know in feb 2024 that she is not able to go embassy to give statement via Video conferencing. Upon drilling down, i got a hint that she has lied in her passport application that she is unmarried. This made me wonder, if she could go to that extent, her disdain for me could not allow her to take my surname in her passport. She could have somehow manipulated Aadhar as well.\n\nAlso, her family has a criminal and political background.\n\n\n**My question is, can she go back to passport office and tell the officials that it was a mistake? Or will it considered a crime  no matter what. **\n\n\nEdit: i dont think people are understanding the point here. For me to give her divorce, she has to withdraw cases, obviously. For that to happen, she has to go to embassy for video conference, which she can’t do because when she claimed she is unmarried how come she has filed 498a (the embassy will ask). I think i might have touched some feminists’ ultra sensitive parts here. But i haven’t filed a single false case against this woman, yet. Only she has. \n\nEdit 2: people are also missing the point that how could she have changed the surname in aadhar card before divorce? If she has given duplicate or older aadhar card, that is a bigger crime isn’t it?\n\n#passportlaw #indianpassport #passportfraud",

        "text": "Every startup, along with a good idea and strategy, needs money to grow. But how will you, a budding entrepreneur, raise funds without knowing the right people?\n\nOne of our clients, a start-up founder, faced this problem too! This is what happened with him:\n\n1. Let's call our client Mr. V. He approached a 'Startup Investment Consultancy,' seeking investors for his company.\n2. The consultancy connected him with an investor, to whom Mr. V pitched his idea.\n3. The investor offered INR 4,00,00,000 to Mr. V, even though the demand was for INR 40,00,000.\n4. Mr. V agreed to go forward with the deal. However, before releasing the funds, the consultancy asked Mr. V to sign an agreement.\n5. As per the agreement, Mr. V was required to put in a **refundable security deposit** of INR 4,00,000. The consultancy issued a post-dated cheque, which Mr. V can encash in case the deal does not go through.\n6. Mr. V was oblivious to a termination clause in the agreement which stated that in case ANY party backs out of the deal, the security deposit will be forfeited by the consultancy.\n7. To put it simply, even if the investor decides to back out of the deal, the complete security deposit will go to the consultancy.\n8. As expected, the deal did not go through, and Mr. V deposited the cheque to the bank to claim the deposit.\n9. The cheque bounced due to insufficient funds. The consultancy stopped responding to calls and attempts to communicate thereafter.\n\nThe case is going to court. Such consultancies and scammers prey on the desperation of startup founders to make it big.\n\n**Here's what to do if you are approaching a startup consultancy to raise funds:**\n\n1. Always conduct due diligence on the consultancy. A quick Google Search with the keyword <consultancy name+scam+fraud> will give you what you are looking for.\n2. Without proper documentation, a sound idea, and a transparent term and balance sheet, no investor will give a huge chunk of his money to you. If someone seems too eager to provide you with cash, it is too good to be true.\n3. Always do a background check on the history of the investor.\n4. Get agreements and contracts vetted by a lawyer before signing. Every mischief is hidden in the fine print.\n\nGrow fast, but grow safe!",

Even If A Women Working Hard For Her Money Gets Ripped Off By A Guy In Divorce. I Will Still Feel Same For Her. But This Situation Is Very Rare)**\n\nAfter seeing so many people getting offended just because a men don’t want to take dowry but also don’t want to pay alimony. With all the confusion today i booked appointment with best attorney of my city. \n\nWhat i got to know that i am already safeguarded from alimony and he said i don’t even needed to form a Trust. He said if i ever go through divorce court only have power to order me to pay maintenance based on my salary that i take from my company that’s only 2.5L annually maximum court can order me to pay maintenance of 25-30% of the salary. \n\nAlso he told me about very similar case closed in M.P high court last month where a guy who makes around 20-25 cr annually was going through a divorce. In his case even the company was also on his own name. But all the assets house cars he bought on the name of company. He didn’t bought directly on his own name. His wife tried so hard to claim huge amount but eventually failed. As that guy takes around 40k in salary from his own company. Even judges knows that this guy is rich but they can’t make order against law as company and person is two different entity. Though he is making 20-25cr annually court ordered him to pay 30% of his salary in maintenance which is 12k per month. \n\nHe told me in my case i have an extra layer that even the company is not registered on my own name. Also lawyer told me still you want more extra layer you can form a trust but its not needed . And he said you can take another step for extra layer that is file a case from your own father to yourself demanding maintenance and than agree to pay maintenance and try to pay as much high as possible as court have threshold of ordering 1/3 salary as a maintenance.if i pay 30% to my dad than in case of divorce court can only order me to pay 3.3% of salary as a maintenance that too of my just 2.5L annual salary (this is all done by my own lawyer its just a tactic so you will have more liability to show to the court)",

My mother had made 22L to 24L and she gave everything to him to buy house.\n\nLong story short, because of my bro’s shitty marriage my parents, against our guidance sold the house at 85L. No plans of what to do next.\n\nCurrent issue:\nI was back in Mumbai because of my bro’s shitty marriage and living on rent near office. I had to rush and make a house purchase within a month. I bought a 2 crore 2BHK house, used the 85L from sale deeds, my entire savings (which I saved to start a business) and a 80L loan. Thankfully I stood my ground of not involving my bro in EMI considering his previous track record.\n\nNow I am paying monthly EMIs, maintenance and renovation for the house. My parents spent some money but they want to round figure to 5L. I am ok with that too. My parents and I lived at this new place together. I take care of all their needs. This was all before I was married.\n\nNow my bro is upset, because his wife thinks my parents gave everything to me. Me and my husband will live there forever, which we don’t. \n\nMy parents have not decided how they want to share their assets, but there is always tension on how to solve this problem.\n\nWe have property at native which is also similar to my parents share in the city house. So we thought if we let him enjoy the native house, which he frequents to and has invested in. And me keep the Mumbai house. But his response is but we won’t be selling the native house. So he wants cash and a house. \n\nI am upset because I am paying EMIs, maintaining the house and want to do major renovations for my newly married life BUT I cannot because of constant tension.\n\nI am not allowed to sell the house or pay them off either. Everyone is sentimental and adding stress. What can I do to safeguard myself?",

        "text": "\nPosting on behalf of my friend that isn't on Reddit. \n\nAbout a year back, my father retired from his govt job. He was approached by a neighbor to discuss about wealth management after retirement. After about a week, 3 officials- Associate director of wealth team, Relationship manager and another representative from a very well known Private Scheduled Indian bank came to our house to discuss more in detail about this. My dad was interested in policies offered by the bank to manage retirement funds.\n\n\n My father had a disposable investment amount of 1 crore. The team suggested to buy a policy of 1 crore with yearly premium payment of 20 lakhs for 5 years. In the presence of the other two bank representatives, Associate director convinced my dad that balance of 80 lakhs shall be invested in mutual funds and deposits and that this was a very safe , promising way forward. Also assured that the capital is absolutely protected as this was a very big and trusted Indian bank. But later he made my dad to download a third party trading application to this end ,and made him initially  invest 50 Lakh telling it was for mutual funds, but instead he used the funds to invest in currency trading. He convinced my father to invest further 20 lakhs from the balance of initial deposit of one crore in bank when he lost the initial funds. By this time, my father started alerting the wealth team of the bank through phone calls which was shot down by the team and kept assuring my father that his capital will always be protected. \n\n\n\nFor a senior citizen being from middle class, it was completely out of his domain to understand how his funds was being utilized in the name of renowned bank. (not realizing that third party trading application was not connected with the bank in any way)\nUltimately the associate director of wealth team had lost all the capital and he absconded. Now the bank is not holding any accountability to retrieve my father's lost corpus nor is helping him get legal justice from the culprit being the employee of the bank. We took this issue to the highest level of the bank however the resolution was not in my father's favor and they used the fact of using third party application to trade the funds against my father. They acknowledged that he was a fraud but are not taking accountability for the fraud housing in their company.\n\n\n\nI want to use this platform to reach out to anyone who has faced something similar. Also I am hoping to get advise on how to go about this legally against this Bank.",

        "title": "Really fed up with our legal system - Case against the State going for 24 years",
        "text": "It is a long post, please bear with me\n\nMy(M24) grandfather (M84, still alive) owned a property in Koramangala Bangalore, and had a factory on it, for many years, till around the time I was born, when one unfortunate day(it was a few days after I was born), Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) came and demolished it, citing that the land was theirs. The case pertaining to this has been going on for about 24 years now.\n\n Now, let me explain the facts of our case. The property that my grandfather bought, was from a third party person(X). Now, X owned a large piece of land in the area(consisting of about 150 sites, today) which the BDA agreed to buy from him to develop into a layout. There was some advance money transfer as well, and the agreement was signed between X and the BDA to buy the land. But BDA did not go forward with the deal, and there is some law that if the the land is not developed within 15 years by BDA the agreement lapses. The BDA did not do anything for more than 15 years, so X himself divided the land into plots and sold them(this was a clean sale, as many of our lawyers validated). My grandfather was one of those people who bought the plot. We have all documents to prove ownership and my grandfather had paid property tax for years after he bought the land.\n\nNow a few days after I was born, the BDA demolished my grandfather's factory and the neighbour's property citing that the property was theirs. This was an unjust demolition, even if we assume that their claim was true, because out of the 150 sites in the area, they demolished only 2 sites. Later we came to know that the then district collector had some enimity with our neighbour guy, and he wanted to demonstrate his power, so his primary aim was to demolish that person's property, and the demolition of our property was collateral damage. \n\nNext comes the lawyers. After this event my grandfather became nearly bankrupt. He put all his savings into hiring a good lawyer who initially handled the case very well. Right when we were about to win, he absonded. We suspect that he was bought over by the opposition (which were public prosecutors). This also happened with next lawyer that we hired. After that we no longer had the money to hire good lawyers, and all the lawyers we hire initially say that our case is a clean win and then just drag on the case. The case is going on till now.\n\nNow all this while, the high court gave an interim order about 10 years ago, that the BDA allot an alternative site in Bangalore within 3 months of the order to my grandfather to compensate him. Till now the site has not been given by BDA.\n\nAt this point we feel that the entire state apparatus is moving against us. The state has infinite resources to drag the case for eternity, but not us. My grandfather is already 84, feeble and weak and he has no energy, money and time to fight this case. I myself have started earning, but not enough to hire big lawyers. Even if we hire big lawyers, we're scared that they might be bought over. Right now our aim has been to just keep the case alive, hoping that somewhere sometime in the future our destiny would turn. But still, I'm here asking for opinion on what's the best course of action for us to do with this case, to get justice asap, just in case we missed some options we could have taken?",

        "title": "Just another Desi dad falsely accused of 498A case!",
        "text": "So my case sadly is a very common one: I live in US, I am from Hyderabad. 9 years ago I decided to get married. I joined a matrimonial site and there I was approached by my fingers crossed soon to be ex wife’s father. He contacted me, asked the questions and basically introduced me to my now wife (she also lived and lives in US). We lived in different states, met a few times and were married in three months here in US. We also went to India and got married there as well. My family and I do not believe in asking for dowry (not she had the money anyways) so we didn’t ask for one. We got married and both came back to US.\n\nShe is educated it and makes over 6 figures salary. I am also educated and make double her salary (This fact is important because now I was targeted from day one). Fast forward to a year after my child was born; she started it been demanding of my inheritance, mind you no one has died yet, so I don’t even have it yet. Her and her family started it putting pressure on me to make drama with my family over money, my family is not like that, so I didn’t it. Well, she left me and asked me to please let her move with my child to her home town here in US, me naively let her. Well as soon as moved she file a DV false case against me and filed for divorce. Not only she did it here, she did the classic move of going to India for “Vacation” and while there she file a 498A, DV and the classic dowry charge (remember I didn’t even ask for one).\n\nFast forward to now; she has filed at least 10 more cases in India, has paid over $60,000.00 American dollars to the Hyderabad court and also paid to blacklisted my family and myself. She claimed in the Indian court that she is a housewife who does not work and I abandoned her and the child and fled to the US and left her with no money in India. Is been three years and the case in on stand still in India because she is paying a lot of money to the police and the court. \n\nThe question is, what can I do? Can file a case against her for lying? She has the police and politicians harassing my family, telling them to advise me to just “Do the right thing” and give her all of the land we bought together, the properties and even some that belongs to my family. To give her the money and assets that we have here and if I do all of this, she might consider coming into an agreement. I already offered her 70% of everything, all I asked was to be able to be with my child in peace. That was not enough, she wants 90% and full control of the child and for me to see the child once a week. \n\nSo Reddit Lawyers, people going through this, what can I do? Is not about the money, if I settle and give her all that she wants, it won’t end there, she is also doing everything here to keep my child away from me and she has no plans to give me the divorce. She keeps manipulating the system by creating delays, she is on her 10th lawyer because they all quit or she fires them. \n\nHere in US I am all set, thank God she is a terrible lair so the judge, clerks and even the GAL knows she is the problem, so things are going my way here. But in India still very bad, I have not seen my family in years, I cannot go see them and they cannot come see me. Please HELP! What can I do. Since the police and the courts are been bribed, is there any one I can go that is above them? Who can I report them to and let them know what is happening? Is there a TV station, news paper or anyone that make this abuse public? She is all about image and has lied to everyone that I left her, she would hate for her far relatives and friends to see the paper work showing that she is the one that left the home. \n\nAny advice will be very appreciated it. I also want to some how help other Indian dads and husbands going through this, so I want join organizations that do activism and report all of these abuse happening in the India family court system. Thank you for reading  and if you are going through this I hope your case gets resolved soon! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾",

I am 20 year old , I look like a boy, this whole sh\\*t family was on me for no reason. in between his wife and daughter , means that dumbf\\*k girl and her mother also tried to slap me but it didn't reached me properly. then i took out my phone and started calling police 112, so they tried to snatch my phone first then said \" bula bula , hm bhi bulate h\". \n\nin  hat \"tata punch rich ghamandi family\" , 2 members had some mind. they were constantly saying \"sorry brother , aap chale jao\". because of which i cut the police call at that time.\n\nknow I think i did no mistake and they are liable for legal consequences for such actions. but I don't know how should i proceed safely? or even should i proceed for this small matter? they were more than 10 and i was alone. please help . I want that this kind of sh\\*t shouldn't happen to anyone.\n\nEDIT: I said the daughter hdumbf@@ck, since she was younger like me and looked educated, but she yelled at me the most and shouted the whole time \"meri road h\" and tried to assault me. I am not a misogynist. Everyone deserves to be criticised for what they did irrespective of gender. And here the daughter and mother were leading and yelling the most. They were the one who tried to assault me first.\n\nLatest Edit: \nThank you everyone for such great responses. I have decided to let them rot in their ego. let them kill each other in anger. these dumbf@ck will surely get fuc*ked by some other dumbf@k one day.\n\nhere is little more i want to share...\n\nI cannot stop myself when i am being treated badly, when someone opress me, or violate my rights. The very first incidence of my life , i was in 6th class.on way back to home The DTC govt bus driver was abusing us and pulling our hairs , he was harassing us, i abused him and said i am writing your bus number and will complaint to dtc and started writing the bus no with pen, he came to me and slapped me, i pushed him then both the conductor and driver hit me. I ran to police station and reported that incident. The next day the bus driver was changed for the same bus and same route. After that i have never kept quite. i had fight with doctors, lawyers,Police, govt employees, IAS, politicians and more , and if i tell you the story you will tell me to kill such people. i and my group have damaged properties and beaten people in fight, also got beaten sometimes.\n\nafter my 12th class during my graduation i got lot of exposure, i read books and learnt philosophy, pyschology etc. which made me think of my actions and others actions. Now i keep calm and believe in legal battles.\n\nthe reason i told you my story is, I think if such things happens to educated and aware civillians, what worse condition can be of poor, uneducated and underprivileged people. i can't think what they face in their daily life. \n\ni don't know what is the solution of these, but one thing is for sure, if poeople starts treating everyone equally this can be solved. if they stop judging, stop running for power and money this can be solved. if everyone adds politeness and fraternity in their character this can be solved.

Now I didnt declare my shoes while checking in I didn't think that shoes are something you declare right before checking in as they are part of my personal items and not as per say \"valuable items\" like electronics, jewellery etc. Please help how I can get compensation for my shoes from the airline and if you could reccomend any legal avenues against air India for my claim. Any help is appreciated thanks !!",

It's about to be completed and only a few final things are left to do now. OP was going to get the questions and answers from the internet archive's snapshots of Toppr. But OP is not sure if Toppr will take any action if OP does this and launch a website. Does this cover scraping the QnA from the Internet Archive?\n\n  \nOP IS vry much excited to make this but need help in figuring this out. It would be best if there is still some way to get their QnA as it doesn't seem toppr will be back, and today Byjus was also taking a lot of time to load. Others are good but don't have many text solutions.\n\nPS: Topr is a subsidary of Byjus, which is about to be bankrupt. Due to this, there is possibility that Topr might shut down for good, as Byjus does not have the funds to run it.\n\n  \n",

I believe she won't do anything to mess up my life.*\n\nWe've been friends since 2019, started dating six months ago, and recently moved in together. Her mom and sister know we live together, and my parents and cousins in my family also know.\n\nShe's struggling with addiction, specifically to Xanax and Tramadol, and she told me about it before moving in. We're slowly lowering the medication so she can overcome it in the next six months. Once that's done, I plan to introduce her to the rest of my family. I haven't told my family about the addiction yet. (Her family knows about the addiction)\n\n# My fears\n\n1. She is trying to leave the pills, I know it. I closely monitor it, but there have been instances that I have caught her talking to medical stores to procure the pills. She has relapsed multiple times, it's taking a toll on my mental health. **What if she's not able to leave the pills ever?** I don't like her in that state, she's unreliable and confused when on the pills.\n2. She's very obsessed with me, **I'll die without you kinda obsessed**. She constantly calls whenever I'm away. I can't spend time with my family happily. (I'm still  in my early 20s) She's **super insecure**. When I call her out, **she says, \"it's just because of the pills and I'll be normal later.\" I'm not sure.**\n3. The main thing I'm scared of is **what if it doesn't work out**. She never leaves the pills and doesn't change her bad behaviors. What If I decide to end the relationship, a**nd she decides to go all out for me, with her toxic family behind her**?\n\n# What to do?\n\nI've mentioned to her that it's not gonna work out with the pills. She knows it and doing everything to make it work. At the same time, I don't wanna be irrational because if this turns out badly, can potentially ruin my entire life.\n\nI am in a very delicate situation being a man, and the Indian legal system being what it is. Especially, after the recent introduction of section 69. **What measures should I take to safeguard my life in case of a worst-case scenario?**",

        "text": "My parents had access to my bank account connected to dmat account.\nMy father gained access into my bank account and  transferred 6 lakhs from HUF into my account. This is counted as a loan. This amount was then squandered away by my mother in share market. \nThe loan amount incurs a commerical rate of interest.\n\nThe issue is that both the trading account and bank account are in my name, although all of this was done without my permission or knowledge by my parents.\n\nI got to know about this situation when I was pursuing my masters in a different place, my father contacted me and made me aware about the whole situation.\n\nSo far I can not see any plan from their side to return the amount to HUF. \n\nWhat legal action and preparation can I form to secure my position and to get the amount back from my parents.\n\nEdit: I'd like to provide more clarity here.\nHUF is Hindu Undivided Family account. Here members of the family pool their income.\nThe Karta of this HUF is my Father, that is why he was able to allow the transaction from the HUF account to my account.\n\nIn my previous conversation with my father, he has explicitly said it is a loan. The money is obviously from the family fund, it was not earned solely by my father. The pool belongs to my grandfather, chacha and papa. \n\nAbout my account: When I turned 18 my mother opened my zerodha account and kept essential details like id, password with her, she submitted her own mobile number too.\n\nAs for the savings account attached to this bank account,it was opened as a minor account ( when I was 11 years old). I'm not sure what happened, but the mobile number submitted for this account is again my mother's.\n\nNeedless to say I immediately took over the control of my accounts when I got the wind of this scandal. It was very tough for me to change the mobile number for zerodha account because it requires OTP from the previous mobile number too, which was my mother's.\nMy bank account still has my mother's number. I will have to change it.\n\nAbout my relation to my parents: hot and cold at the best, too complex to define. They were very abusive when I was younger, it has caused quite a many issues with me, so I'm taking therapy. Right now the relation is... ok (?).\n My mother has previously made huge loses in her own trade market account and also in my father's.\n I'm very sad that he esssentially enabled my mother to do the same in my account.\n Being young and 18, I was very naive, didn't care about the control she has had on my financial state.\n\nCurrent state: I've completed my masters in a basic sciences field and preparing for fellowship exams for Ph.D. (and taking therapy for mental fuck ups :) ) So, I'm completely financially dependent on my parents.\nEven if I do get a fellowship, the stipend will not be good enough for repaying the loan, and why should I repay it? It was not taken by me or by my knowledge. My earnings should be directed for my future and savings, not dissolve into loan repayments.\nMy father has been to the ICU thrice since my graduation, so this wouldn't be a good time to trigger this conversation. \n\nI still want to be ready legally, should they flip in the future. I had an idea from the start itself that it will prove to be a tough case. \n\n\nThey did the transaction in my home state, while I was in another state, also the mobile number used was mother's.\n If I do get proof for these things, I may be able to form a case for my self.\n\nFor now I think I'll have to consult a CA. I could have used a lawyer's help for direction though, in regards to what more evidences I could collect.\n\nThanks to all people who tried to help.\nP.S I'm a woman, not a man.",

        "title": "Abusive alcoholic husband - need advice.",
        "text": "My (35f) Husband (39m) is an alcoholic.  He drinks every day, sometimes starting in the morning. For the past year or so, he has been emotionally abusive and recently he slapped me once and shoved me etc. He has also forced me for physical relations. \n\nWe have 2 children, 5 years & 10 months. I am educated to masters but have not worked for about 10 years now, so I don't have a career nor do I have any financial independence.  \n\nH doesn't currently work. He had a job at the time of our wedding but quit to join his father's business but then had a disagreement with his father about 2 years ago and has since been looking for a job with no luck. We still live together with his parents and unmarried older sister. His father still provides for all of our expenses including travel tickets for me to visit my parents, who live abroad, twice in the last four years (cost must have been about 2 lakhs for both trips together). \n\nNow since he has been abusive, i have no desire to stay with him anymore. Ideally i would like to walk away with my children and never look back at him or his family, and not expect anything from them either. But as my family is abroad, i dont have a place i can easily go to. My father is on work visa and mother is a dependent. I would only be able to get a visitor visa to go there, even if i could afford the tickets for kids and me, and that would only be for 3 months. Also, baby doesnt have a passport yet. \n\nMy parents are not very well off financially. They mostly live hand to mouth and also have some debt. They own one property in india which they have been trying to sell as it will help pay off a lot of the debt. So they cant afford our tickets or be able to support us financially for long-term. \n\nI want to know what my options are for legal separation. I know husband will contest just to make it difficult for me. He is good with kids when he is sober, but most of his day is spent outside drinking or asleep at home. \n\nIn-laws didnt ask for any dowry during wedding but as is indian custom, my parents bought jewellery and silverware for me. Half my jewellery is with me and rest in in-laws' locker. I assume they are not so evil thay they will withhold these from me. While they didn't outright ask for anything,  mother-in-law once made a comment that by rights my parents should have bought us fridge etc. And father-in-law and husband implied that some of my jewels are 18 carat gold (they are not). Father-in-law just said it once. Husband said 'you tried to fool us'.\n\nAlso, (my parents don't even know about this) Husband has taken a gold loan to repay a friend and has mortgaged some of my jewels for this (worth about 1.75 lakhs maybe - but one necklace from this was a wedding gift from in-laws). When i bring this up, he talks about the travel tickets that they paid for so I'm not sure whether i will get this jewellery back. \n\nWhen he hit me, i told him i want a divorce. I wanted to leave that same night but couldn't because i had nowhere to go and no money.  Now he knows how helpless i am and cant really go anywhere so he has been verbally cruel and mocking and even brings up divorce hinself, saying things like 'ask your father to arrange for the papers and go away, i can take care of my children '. I am worried he will use the children against me. \n\nAlso he says my father owes him compensation bacause H and his family have provided for me (food, basic needs etc) during the years of our marriage. This sounds ridiculous to me but does it mean anything legally? Also H has bought 3 phones for me since we were married, one was a wedding gift. \n\nSince we live together, my mother-in-law does all the cooking. Early in the marriage she told me she doesn't need help as she is a fast cook. Sometimes i knead dough or do little things like that. Otherwise i take care of children full time snd when i have free time i do small household chores like hanging/folding clothes, some dusting. For a couple of years during peak Covid, we didn't have househelp, so i did more work then (sweeping/dishes). Husband is constantly saying that i never help his mom and I'm useless. \n\nEvery afternoon when my baby is napping i talk on the phone to my mother. Phone call timing has ranged from 10 minutes to over 30 sometimes. Both husband and mother-in-law have commented on how i talk on the phone so much. I only speak to my mother when i literally have nothing else to do. Older son is watching TV or playing and younger is sleeping. H also hates when I talk to my best friend (once a month maybe) or visit her (once in 3 months maybe).\n\nMy father in law mostly ignores the situation. My mother in law is always defending her son. I complain about his abuse and she tells me not to provoke him. She enables his drinking and idleness. When he runs out of money, he tells her and she  asks his father to send him more. \n\nAnyway, the instances of emotional abuse/verbal cruelty are endless and i have already written a very long post. All i want is to be free of this family and live peacefully with my children. Any advice is appreciated.",

Rather he wants me to discuss every expense I would have for her and then he would pay half of those. He also believes those expenses doesn’t include rent since anyway I am not going to pay extra for her. \nRegarding the house, if we sell the house, is there a way for me get more money since I paid almost entire down payment and till date he has only paid 50% of mortgage? What about the furniture in the house? He wants to keep it all  without paying me anything.\nIs it better to file divorce in India or Canada?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all your replies. Many of you suggested going back to Canada. If I go and file divorce there, it’s very likely court would order 50-50 custody which would mean I would be stuck in Canada. I don’t want to live next 16 years of my life in a country I don’t like it live in, that’s my concern. He wasn’t a great father when we were together also and he told many times he will remarry and have children soon. So living in Canada doesn’t look like a good option for my daughter either.",

Only the bare legs were visible which were 90 degree from the body and the rest of the body including face was covered with a saree. There is a possibility that it was a case of sexual assault. She informed the nearest police station and they took the body. She called them back to find out what happened thereafter and they simply replied that they would take the body to mortuary. \nThe police can't declare death, they should have confirmed the death first. When she asked about it further, they told that the lady who lost her life was a beggar on that street and asked my friend if she wants to file a complaint. She doesn't have any problem in filing a complaint but she isn't sure if it would cause a problem for her. What should be done here??",

        "title": "28F What to do when indirectly forced to leave job",
        "text": "I am a QA engineer 28F in an IT company in Pune. I live with an extremely toxic family. The Family is toxic only because of my paternal aunt. Let's call her \"aunt\" for this post.\r  \n\r  \nI unfortunately never had the chance to live with my mother and father. This is because my mother had divorced my father when I was 1 year old. \r  \n\r  \nMy father got married second time and left the house. So I had to live with my Grandmother, grandfather and aunt. My Grandmother is the one who loved me unconditionally and raised me. My Paternal uncle is the one who paid for my education.\r  \n\r  \nFast forward to the last 4 years. I am the sole earner in the house because father doesn't provide financial support and uncle has become an alcoholic due to his past.\r  \n\r  \nSo basically everyone demands money from me in the house and I'm not able to save anything for myself. That is also okay for me, I'm still doing those sacrifices because they are my family.\r  \n\r  \nMy Aunt  is making my life total hell. She never married and is aged enough that it's almost impossible for her to get married. She has collected enough money from me to set up her \"business\" (I don't know what business).\r  \n\r  \nShe has gaslighted me for my entire life and obtained money from me by emotional manipulation. Now that her work is done and she doesn't need my money anymore, she is hell bent on making me lose my job. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \nShe has manipulated my grandmother into thinking that I have an affair with someone. This is simply not true. I had to come back to my hometown 4 years ago due to work from home. Since then I'm basically living in an indirect house arrest. I'm fine with that as well. Now, grandma is blackmailing me emotionally that \"I will die but not let you go to Pune even if your job demands it\".\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nMy Aunt is making every possible move to make me lose my job. She's saying that \"Don't accept promotions or ever become a manager because if they ever call you in the office, we'll never let you go. We will do every possible thing to make you lose your image in your company and lose the job.\"\r  \n\r  \nI tried talking them out how my career is important\r to me and I will take care of them like I always do. But my Grandmother has become stubborn and is emotionally blackmailing me that she'll unalive herself if I leave the house. All this because of my Aunt. She gaslights me by saying that she doesn't want to let me go to Pune or progress in my career because \"Life is more important than career, the outside world is a dangerous place. I'm doing this because I love you more than your job.\" but I clearly understand that this is just a statement to hide her jealousy from me on the fact that she was always unemployed.\r  \n\r  \nMy hometown is a very bad place for women. I've been eve teased once.\r  \n\r  \nMy Aunt has controlled me ever since I was a kid because obviously I was fully neglected by parents. No mother and inattentive father.\r  \n\r  \nDo you guys have any suggestions to talk my grandmother out or taking legal actions against my Aunt to save my job is the only way? If legal action is the only way then please suggest me what I can do. They just can't make me lose my job and jeopardize my career.\n\nEdit 1: I am unable to leave my house due to the restrictions put on me and the people of my community can probably give me a beating if I try to leave the house. Please note that I've never faced domestic violence ever in my life. Just mental harassment. \n\nEdit 2: By indirect house arrest, I meant that I'm not allowed to travel outside my hometown. I'm allowed to go just outside the house with the condition that my aunt will go with me all the time. So I'm not able to plan anything at all because inside the house she's always keeping an eye on me and outside the house also she's always with me.\n\nAnother direction I would like to say is that only my aunt is responsible for making my life miserable. My grandmother and my uncle used to be very supportive once upon a time. But this woman is turning people against me as if she owns me.\n\n\nNote: It's a humble request that please do not advise me to get married.\n\n\nEdit 3:--\n\nI have asked my father to take care of my documents. He said that he's ready to help. Getting out of this situation is easier said than done.\n\nThe amount of support I got from this post has given me the will to live and handle things with a calm mind. Some comments were so nice that I almost cried reading them. I was mentally very down during the time I posted this. I will forever feel grateful to you guys. I wish to reply to every single comment and thank the commenter. However it's a little difficult to reply since my aunt keeps an eye on me all the time. \n\nTHANK YOU GUYS FOR GIVING ME SO MUCH STRENGTH. YOU SAVED SOMEONE'S LIFE INDIRECTLY. THANK YOU, THANK YOU.",

Until now, I would get his call and go get my order, but recently he has been entering my house and looking around without my permission.\n\nI have decided to now keep the door lock, which was dumb of me to not have been doing so far, but here's the problem. Something like this, with other people where I live, has happened about 3-4 times.\n\nVendors come, look around, and then rob.\n\nYup, just last years, 2 happened. And they came with guns. Some guys came selling some carpets, looked around, checked for how many lived in each house, etc... and then robbed two houses, though they were once unsuccessful (though still not all of them were caught by the police), they did end up brutally hurting a lady, my neighbour.\n\nSo, having seen this happen, I don't think that I am very paranoid. So now, what do I do? it seems like he's gonna keep on delivering them, other than locking the main gate, what do I do? He has already looked around a lot, and I do feel scared :( Can't exactly trust delivery folks when I've seen them rob my LITERALY NEIGHBOURHOOD.",

He claimed the pin code was incorrect, even though it had been auto-detected by Amazon.\nHe then told me he would reschedule the order for tomorrow due to the incorrect pin code and said he was sending me an OTP to confirm the rescheduling. Unfortunately, in my urgency, I gave him the OTP, and that’s where I made a mistake.\nThe delivery person used the OTP to hack into my Amazon account. When I checked my account to see if the order had been rescheduled, I found it had been canceled. I called the delivery person back, and he acted surprised, pretending not to know why this had happened.\nI immediately contacted Amazon customer service through Chat to explain the situation and request the delivery for today. To my shock, the delivery person who hacked my account started chatting with customer service at the same time, trying to request them to keep the order cancelled and even providing his contact number in the chat!\nI had a long call with Amazon customer service and even got the delivery person on a conference call. During the call, he admitted to logging into my account. The Amazon representative assured me they would take strict action against him. I also requested that the person be sacked, which I said directly during the conference call.\nI’m still in shock over what happened. I’ve changed my account password, but I’m afraid because the delivery person knows my address. I’m worried he might hold a grudge against me if any action is taken against him or if he’s fired.\nShould I take further action? Has anyone else experienced something like this?

I used to visit her every alternate weekends, until her mother  decided that my presence isn't conducive to her second marriage. I have court orders saying that both of us have joint custody, but the ex-wife doesn't give shit about the court orders and is acting in outright contempt of court orders. I last met my daughter in March when I managed to find a sympathetic police inspector to order them to bring my daughter to the station so I can meet her, but thereafter i was told that the police can't do much in family matters. And from what I understand of the legal system, the worst that can happen to the mother is that court ordering her to 'behave in my daughter's best interests'.\n\nWhen I finally managed to speak to my daughter a month ago on the phone she was completely hostile towards me. I fear that I will completely lose her. I've already been through 3 sets of lawyers in Chennai  over the past years and am just utterly disappointed in the way they handle things. \n\nI'm looking for a proper lawyer who can really work the system to make sure that I am a part of my daughter's life so that i make sure that she grows up to be a balanced person.\n\nPlease help, I'll do whatever it takes at this point.",

Any documents, chats, media, or communication records depicting your relationship with the complainant. This helps in identifying the nexus between you and the other individual.\n2. Any suggestive history of the complainant's nature to falsely accuse individuals in such cases.\n3. Any threats or suggestive communication from the complainant to you.\n4. This is important. DO NOT hide sensitive information from your lawyer, even if it might embarrass you. They are there to help you.\n\nIf there's strong evidence that you have been falsely accused, you can file a defamation suit in the court of law seeking compensation and an apology from the complainant.\n\n**Note:** False accusations lead to loss of reputation, mental peace, and some instances, life itself.

A biker, who wasn’t wearing a helmet, tried to overtake an auto from the opposite direction and ended up hitting our car head-on on the driver’s side. The impact caused the airbags to deploy, and thankfully, none of my family members were seriously injured. However, the biker was severely injured.\n\nMy dad immediately called an ambulance and ensured the biker was taken to the hospital. Unfortunately, the biker passed away later due to a stroke caused by blood loss. His family filed an FIR against my dad at the local police station, and he secured bail. On advice from others, we chose not to file a counter-FIR because there’s often an assumption in such cases that the larger vehicle is at fault.\n\nNow, we’ve received a notice from the Bengaluru Tribunal naming me (the vehicle owner) and the insurance company as respondents, seeking ₹50 lakh in compensation for the biker’s family. This has left us confused, as the accident occurred in Andhra Pradesh, and traveling to Bengaluru for the hearings will be extremely difficult for us.\n\nHere are my questions:\n\n1. Is it legal for them to file the case in Bengaluru when the accident happened in Chittoor?\n2. Can we request to have the case transferred back to Chittoor?\n3. Should we now file a counter-FIR since the biker was overtaking recklessly and wasn’t wearing a helmet?\n4. What’s the best way to handle this situation?\n\nSome additional details:\n\n* The car is registered in my name.\n* My dad was driving very cautiously as we had a pregnant family member in the car.\n* The biker wasn’t wearing a helmet.\n* We haven’t filed an FIR against the biker.\n* The car is covered by third-party insurance.\n* We’re looking at repair costs exceeding ₹2,00,000 for the car.\n\nAny advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.

        "text": "So I met this indian girl[25F] on Whatsapp through a friend and we've been talking for 4 days. She claims she's mentally ill and was traumatised by a sexual encounter with her boyfriend. I choose to talk to her because even I suffer from mental illnesses and having someone who is going through the same problems might help me feel better as they can understand me and support me.\n\nOne day they sent me a voice recording of what happened that day and I was tired of her trauma dump but I didn't want to abandon her because I felt bad so I listened to it and then just gave her some pointers that since she was a minor, she cannot consent to it and it could be rape and then she starts overthinking and claims that her life is now ruined and she thanked me for ruining it and sent me a message that she would unalive herself.\n\nI started freaking out terribly and decided to go to the police station. after some hours her friend and I were put on a conference call and she desperately pleaded to not go when i messaged her friend everything, she promised that she wouldn't do such a thing and i had her send a message confirming it was a joke in case the cops come after me. I was friendly with her but what she did shocked me so much, I blocked her and her friend and exported and chats and messages and saved them.\n\nI did not ask her to harm herself or harass her. Is it possible for the police to frame me if she decides to do it? her friend is now blaming me that i shouldn't have told her she was raped and now i am scared. what should i do?\n\nedit: thank you very much for helping, people. i have learned a very harsh lesson and i vow to never repeat again. ever since joining university, i was plagued with various mental illnesses, and took medications to calm down my anxiety, ocd, and agoraphobia. i was so lost with my insanity that i used to chat with random online people hoping to make friends and treat myself but this terribly backfired. the healthy version of me would have never done this.",

He said that \"The shop will be on your name, the loan will be on your name. I'll just pay the installments\". He said that the loan is not getting sanctioned for him because although his cibil is very good, he has too many loans on him. So he's unable to obtain loan for buying that shop. He has kind of a reputation when it comes to clearing loans and I've witnessed that in the past.\n\nI (28F) live in Pune and am working in an IT company with 9.5 lpa, and the shop he wishes to buy is in my hometown which is 530 kms from here. Although it sounds like he's being a loving parent by making property for his child, I am a little doubtful here. My heart says that something suspicious is going on and he has some other intentions from this.\n\nCan you guys please guide me?\n\nIf this is suspicious, please also suggest me a polite reply that will help me out of this situation. I'll be forever grateful if you guys suggest me and get me out of this situation.\n\nEdit : The amount of responses and suggestions I got from this post is heartwarming for me. I really wish to reply to every comment and thank you all. But I'm super busy due to office work and will be traveling tomorrow. I'll see if I can find time to thank you all. If not, sorry for that. \n\nThanks for all the support. I will update this post once I refuse him for the loan. Will surely tell you what happened.",

        "text": "I had recently got my device serviced from its authorised service center and the service was horrible. Had to visit multiple times, faced delay in service and the customer representatives were rude. Coming to the point, last time I’d visited the store was with my significant other and as stupid as it sounds, we ended up hugging and kissing each other on the cheek every time the representatives went to the back side of the store, when it was just us in the lobby. We didn’t notice the camera in the store and tbh, as it was a special day for us, we were a little drunk as well. We always made sure no one was in the room when we did it though. Once the customer care representatives came back, I believe they had seen it in the camera and started making fun of us behind our backs which was pretty apparent. Once I received my device back I wrote a very strong review to the company and asked them to share with me an acknowledgment mail informing how they had addressed the issue. About 2 weeks after this, I received a call from the service center and it was the owner at the other end of the call. He said that he had sent me a video on WhatsApp and wanted me to see it. As it was suspected, it was us doing PDA and he threatened that if I didn’t write another feedback revoking the previous one, he’d share it with the company. I’d like to know if any legal action can be taken against this and if the police is approached, what can be their reaction to the situation. I don’t think what the owner did is legal and sharing video footage of such nature even if caught in CCTV without consent is a punishable offence. Please correct me if I’m wrong and suggest how I can deal with the situation.",

There was a time I did not had a single 100 rs note in my pocket to go to court, but I fought and survived.\n\nNow as many people who are unaware of their legal rights ask for advices, I give them that for free, but the procedure and the way out, that's our hard earned acquired knowledge(for which we have read thousands and thousands of pages)  and we chagred fairly for that, please respect us before sending us huge lenghty messages inquiring each and everything about your case for free. I hope none of the professional would like that. (I still do this sometimes for free but can't always do it, I have to feed my hungry stomach and brains.\n\nRecently, a gentleman sent me a dm and asked me to review the contractual document for his office for free, which can easily earn us 10-15k, because to help with technicalities involved to safeguard the clients rights, we have spent lakhs and years to acquire that knowledge, please don't expect us to do that for free, specially when you have the means to hire a lawyer.\n\nPlease respect our profession and us and please understand we too have life to live and a family to feed. \n\nI do help people but only those who fall into the category of free legal aid and even have fought cases and filed cases for them from my own pocket but I, can't do that for everybody, this is our bread and butter, respect us and our knowledge, which can literally save you from spending lakhs in the future. \n\nSorry if I went out of line, but this comes from the heart of struggling young lawyer who is fighting really hard to survive, i don't take any support from my father and live in delhi alone. 30-35k just goes in paying for the basic needs. So let's make it a pact, to pay well to the professionals to take help/assistance from them.",

        "text": "My Indian friend is from Jalandhar originally, and came to the U.S. 9 years ago through an arranged marriage. The marriage turned into a disaster. The father went to prison for several felonies and after her parents died 2 years ago her husbands family made her move out of their home and get a divorce. They tried to call CPS on her to take her son away and CPS saw right through their bullshit. \n\nShe is now living alone in a tiny apartment with her son, working a low wage job in a kitchen to pay the bills. She literally had to learn to drive when she moved out. Now, for the first time in her life she has choices that are hers alone. Up until this point in her life everything was decided for her and she doesn't have the experience to make informed decisions on a lot of things and asks me for help on many questions or concerns. I do my best to make sure she understands the full picture with making decisions so she can decide what she thinks is best for her.\n\nHer father worked abroad and deposited money into two banks throughout his career. From the sound of it, her father did not trust her brother. After her father died suddenly (COVID) he supposedly listed her alone as the nominee for his accounts and house showing to her brother. Her brother keeps trying to get her to sign a document that forfeits her rights to those assets to him. He keeps telling her he will give her some of the money when he sells the house and accesses the accounts. When she asks for her father's will or account information he says he doesn't have it, and yet he knows she is the nominee for his assets somehow and intends to access them after gaining rights. He gets angry with her when she asks him questions, tells her not to talk to anybody or show them anything, and to just trust him because he's her brother. \n\nMy question is this. If she doesn't have the financial means or knowledge to travel to India to solve this issue, what is the best way to access those assets from the U.S.? She is always talking about getting a house for her and her son. If she can get these assets she could do that and live comfortably. Any advice is appreciated.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your help. I'm terribly unfamiliar with Indian law. It sounds like she might be able to get a copy of her father's will if he had one through the local registrar. Either way she needs to at the very least try to contact a lawyer in or near Jalandhar to see what her options are from the U.S. since she doesn't have the means to travel to India. I am hopeful she can at least protect her fair share in the event her brother can travel to India to execute the estate.\n\nEdit 2: Is there a legal document or agreement that would make her brother the nominee while still protecting her right to half of the inheritance?",

I was bit hesitant as I’m generally in my life when I’m around girls. But she insisted so I took them. We were in front seats, and she hopped onto the arm rest to get closer and intimate and took few pictures. I could not believe the intimacy in the first meeting itself. She even suggested that we go to back seat for much easier intimacy, but I declined the offer, and went ahead to drop her. \n\nAnd the next meeting, I was not interested, she started calling and continually messaging (which I’ve not deleted), and I reluctantly agreed to meet. I was working that day, and took my laptop which needed to be charged. So, while we were in car, the talk quickly became naughty, and I suggested we go to OYO as I can charge my laptop and we will get private space as well. She agreed. Booked and went to BTM OYO townhouse. \n\nI kept my laptop for charge. And now, she started showing colors. She says something like: \n\n“My father had put someone in jail because he was hitting on me long back”.\n\n“My father has lot of connections, and he knows where I’m every moment”. \n\n“I’m worried that If my father comes this will be very bad”. — To which, I said, if you’re uncomfortable, you can leave. I said again firmly. And we left. We stayed in OYO for hardly 45mins. \n\n\nNow, in the evening, she texts me and says:\n\n“My father found out about us, and he is going to get you arrested tomorrow”.  \n\nAnd I said: I’m not interested, don’t contact. \n\nShe knows that I earn very well (1 lakh), it all feels like a scam to me, and here I’m shivering and wondering how did I get myself into this mess. I wanted to get married and settled, but things turned sideways. Please help. What do I do? Should I be worried?

        "text": "Hi there\n\nRecently, I (German citizen) traveled from Germany to Singapore with an Indian airline and stopover in Delhi. When I wanted to pick up my checked-in baggage again in SIN, it was absolutely destructed and completely unusable. By a miracle, most of the contents survived. I directly complained at the airport and was told said airline offers INR 10,000 of compensation no questions asked. However, this is barely a quarter of its value and it was brand new so I declined. \n\nI filed a complaint through their website the next day, attaching the damage report I received at the airport, photographic proof, and receipts requesting full compensation.\nAfter a lot of back and forth over the following months with even more waiting for replies on my side, I am exactly where I started. They didn’t give in by an inch. \nI told them about the Montreal Conventions and how they are responsible for my baggage as soon as it is checked in. I literally cited from their own T&Cs that states exactly that. I sent all kinds of proof that confirm my request.\n\nNothing.\n\nIt’s like they didn’t even read my messages. Because they know I won’t do shit because I can’t. Always just replying with the same, big fuck you message. Later I found out why.\n\nSo I asked on the German legal advice subreddit. They recommended the Air Transport Arbitration Body at the Federal Office of Justice before getting an attorney. The Arbitration Body is an “independent and impartial arbitration body. Our aim is to help parties reach mutually agreed settlements in disputes regarding claims for compensation lodged by consumers against airlines for being denied boarding, for delayed or cancelled flights, for problems with baggage[…]”; requesting compensation with a bit more leverage.\n\nAfter filing my case there, I was notified that german jurisdiction has no say in this case because my booking didn’t include a return flight back to Germany (I can provide more details on this if necessary), therefore arbitration cannot legally proceed, and even finding an attorney who would handle this might be difficult.\n\nThere’s basically nothing I can do anymore. I feel really frustrated but I also don’t want to give up and let the airline get away with this injustice, not facing any consequences, although they are part of a legally binding contract, just fucking over their customers and not giving a shit because “Whatcha gonna do huh?”.\n\n\nTLDR: Airline destructs baggage on international flight, refuses full compensation, out of home country’s jurisdiction’s control.\n\n\nI don’t even know if this is the right place for my case but I’d really appreciate any help.\n\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for your help and advice.

Here are a few laws that strengthen your position to keep your pet in society:\n\n1. *2015 Guidelines by the Animal Welfare Board of India (\"****AWBI****\")**:* In 2015, AWBI released revised guidelines, which explicitly state that RWAs cannot ban pets even if the majority of residents are against the same. They cannot pass any by-laws banning pets or restricting them on the basis of their size or their barking. One can approach AWBI against the practice of banning or restricting pets.\n2. *Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960:* Any resolution that harms the safety or environment of an animal violates Section 11(3) of the Act. This violation can warrant legal action against the RWA.\n3. *Redressal with Registrar of Societies:* On a written complaint, the Registrar of Societies has the power to dissolve the RWA for any misconduct or arbitrary decisions. If violations pertaining to animals have taken place on the directions of the RWA, it is sufficient ground for taking action or even dissolution.\n\nNot only this, if an RWA intimidates a pet owner to take their pet out of the society, legal action can be taken under provisions of criminal law, specifically under the Indian Penal Code, 1860.\n\nPets are family, don't let RWAs treat them like an object!\n\nAlso, Happy Dhanteras to all of you!",

There was no communication from the person and he said he is not feeling well. We thought OK, let's give him space. Then today, he asked for server access from another dev and deleted our database, a lot of important files, and server settings.\n\nThis has brought down our whole business and we are still restoring things. We are worried he has stole data or having a mental breakdown and will again do this with the code he has.\n\nThis has caused us a lot of loss, both mental and financial and we are treating it like - “if we have an offline shop, what we will do if someone comes in the night and burn down everything”.

My grandmother was furious but didn't said anything to them directly. From last few weeks I have been talking to each of them and they were just circling me around each other. But today the eldest son refused to pay his father debt and went silent but suddenly bhabhi came in between and continuously shouted at me for hours and said they won't pay that man's (her father in law ) debt . And told me to do what I want. When I asked why are you taking your father in law's money and property after his death if you are not going to claim his debt to. What should we do?

        "text": "Edit: Since people are asking if it's a random rant: It isn't. I ordered a phone that was supposed to be delivered on 28th Sep, then got pushed to 30th, then got pushed to 03rd Oct, then got cancelled without reason. So, this isn't a random rant. This is a first hand experience. \n\n\nBig billion day sales on Flipkart is a big scam. They pretend to give exorbitant discounts - which everyone including me fell prey for. Then they don't deliver the product after a bunch of unannounced and uninitiated reschedules. Eventually, the order gets cancelled. \nI feel like they don't even have the inventory to deliver these products. They overbook on an understocked product. That's cheating in broad daylight. They also don't refund certain platform fees and pickup charges. \nThey take close to a week to even inform us that the order won't be fulfilled. That's a week's worth of thousands of customers' money held by Flipkart when they very well know that they don't have the inventory to fulfill the order and they never wanted to fulfill the order in the first place. \nDon't all these count as fraud and cheating? Besides, even the delivered orders are damaged and used. Some don't have unregistered IMEI, some have damaged screens, a lot of the customers are being charged for safe packaing when the packing is abysmally done.. \nAren't these corporate sharks taking advantage of the common man a little too much? If a class action is going to stand ground, I'm willing to explore the option. \nI've already got forms to reach out to consumer court. I want to know if there's a better way and make this water tight. \n\n",

        "title": "I placed a Railway complain on Twitter and Got A Phone Call from the opposite party. Me and my Family are scared now. ",
        "text": "So It was few days back, when I was travelling by Train from A major station to my home town [ALL ALONE]. I got up the train at the evening, around my berth there were 6 people and 1 old uncle and then it was me.\nI sat on the lower berth (I had upper berth), after few mins some of those(2-3) people started abusing each other (including mother and sister curses) loudly, they abused each other \"Not me or any other people in the coach\". After some time I was convinced they were drunk, to solidify this they started drinking alcohol openly in the coach, they even offered that old uncle and some bypassers and made one of the bypassers drink it, however they didn't over me. Now after 1 hr I got frustated as I wanter To sleep and they were continously shouting and abusing, throwing water bottles each other. So when the TTE came, I asked him to change my seat to which he did change my seat but asked the reason for it and I explained him the situation and He immediately confronted them and threaten them that He would complain on them. And those guys immediately new It was me who complained. While I was shifting my luggage they said me \"You did good right ? \" to which I said \"I didn't Complain\" and continued shifting my luggage. Then while I was climbing on to my upper berth I saw him pointing his finger on to me and telling his friend it was me who complained and he was clearly furious. Now when the TTE came back I told that they now know that I was one who complained and I am afraid, to which both the TTE and one fellow passenger assured me that they couldn't do anything to me as there where other peoples to in the coach and onboard RPF officers would be taking Rounds through the coach and should not worry. \nI was convinced by them and ignored those guys and got onto my seat. Later there shouting and abuses increased and it was audible in the whole coach. I over-heared some female co passenger talking about it and they were uncomfortable, which made a bit sad and I started thinking about it. Earlier while I was sitting among those drunk people I secretly made 4-5 videos in which they were abusing and drinking Alcohol and it was clearly visible in that. Then I called my friend and explained him the situation and I asked him should I place a complain on twitter or not, as I was a bit confused, To which he replied I should place the complaint and I did so. I tagged the RPF and other concerned authorities and uploaded the videos as the evidence. To which I got replies within 5 min from the tagged authorities and they registered my complaint. And RPF officials came at my coach in the next two stations and started calling out loudly \"Who did the complain\". When they first came I was  sleeping so I was not able to attend them, then when they came at the later station they were standing near those people and asking about who did the complain. But I didnt had the courage to go near them complain about them, so I didn't do anything. The officers then got off the train at that station. Then when the trian left the station, those people now got more furious and start to look for for me. To which what I all could do was Cover up the whole blanket on my self and pray they couldn't find me. \nNow the next station was their's to get off the train. \nSo they were finding me, but due to being Drunk and not being in their senses they overlooked me and thought I Got off. But seriously I was scared to my Soul because I was all alone and they were all 5-6 grown up men. However, they could find me or moreover see me (cause I was still in the same Coach) due to being drunk. \nNow after the train left the station I got down and they were gone and all passengers started Bit*hing about them. Then My station came and I got down. \n\nAfter reaching my home I told my parents and few friends about this. And they instantly told that why did you do that, you shouldn't have done that, what if they are powerful people and that type of things. \n\nAnd Guess what They were powerful people indeed. \n\nLast evening I got a call from a random number, I picked up the call, then the opposite person directly started saying \"NAMASTE 'My name' Bhaiya. I was taken aback and conversation continued and it turned out to be that it was there people who were talking very nicely and apologising and requesting me to delete the twitter post beacuse it was bad for the  reputation for the people involved (which I did cuz i was scared and started shitting my pants). I was scared as I haven't shared my Phone Number anywhere but they still got it somehow and my name too. On upon asking who he was he said that \"You have my number and my profile picture on Whatsapp, go find about me\" and on asking how they got my phone number he said \" From PNR number and irctc\" that I had posted in the tweet, and on asking who were the people that I had complained about, he said \"A under-construction mall's owner\". So it was clear that they were Rich and hence powerful. \nBut still he was respectful and apoligising to me on the call and thanked me for deleting the tweet. And I further asked him anything more is happening in the case, he said \"Nothing, be relaxed and again thanked for deleting the tweet \" and asked me to trust him that nothing will happen to me.  \nAnd then he said about what happened to those people who I complained about he said \" They were  held in the RPF station for 4-5 hrs and were fined and many more stuff had happened\". I saw a reply on my tweet from one of the authorities that they had been Charged with 145/146 Under railways act.  \n\nNow After all this I have seen and heard, I was asking myself \"Why did I do it, Why ?????????\". \nI told about this call to my parents and uncle, everybody got scared and all are worried about what if they find my address and moreover I have to commute daily to the same location as of them for my carrer related work (5km apart), this scared them more that what if they see me ?. \n\nI am confused and scared as hell. \n\nTDLR- I complained about drunk co-passenger on twitter. Rpf fined them and made a Case on them. They turned out to be powerful people and somehow found my mobile phone number and asked me to delete the tweet. Me and my family are scared now what if they find me or my address. ",

During this period we met once in nov to exchange our belongings and never again.\nShe on multiple occasions further tried to engage sexually which did end up in sexting but I shunned the irl requests (coz how unstable she seemed mentally ) .\nNow coming to January- it started taking a huge toll on me and I felt burdened to tc of her and thus I decided to go no contact and end it once in for all and then started the series of incredibly stressful conversations with her only goal of making me stay and be with her and taking care of her and here she’d mention of ‘killing herself’ and ‘how she wished she had a knife’ and ‘how much she wanted to kill herself coz of me’ and ‘how she’d cut herself for me’ and so on and so forth \nThis completely scared me a lot!

        "text": "Greetings,\n\nOne month ago, I joined a Indian call centre.\n\nWhen I initially visited, the boss told me that they were helping people in the United States by providing them with loans and insurance during the interview process. So, I thought it was legit and started working there. ( I am very gullible and stupid so I didn't realize it at the time that it was a scam call centre )\n\nI was instructed to call some numbers given on the list provided to me and tell the people who picked up the call that their loan application was approved upto 10,000$ and if they agreed to take the loan then we were to ask them the loan amount they needed... their routing number, account number and other details which was later used by the boss who asked them to secure their loan amount through a 100$ insurance. \n\nSlowly I realized, the list i was given mainly targeted very old people and baited them for loan. The 100$ insurance money was never refunded back to them.\n\nThis was the opening script that I was made to say on call: https://imgur.com/a/gCP71eh\n\nI worked there for a month until I started getting suspicious because the people who were promised loans kept calling back days after the boss said that loans had been given to them and the boss was ignoring their calls after they had send the 100$ or something for insurance. \n\nSo few days ago, I took phone number of one of the lady whose calls were ignored by the boss and secretly called her today. She said that she got scammed of 1500$ in total. My heart was crushed after listening to her.\n\nThat was just one customer. I am pretty sure my boss has scammed many old people in there 70s or 80s baiting them into some personal unsecured loan.\n\nNow, I am feeling really guilty and angry. I'm  planning to report these scammers to the cyber cell.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n(a) Will I get arrested too if I reported the call centre to police because I worked there for a month being ignorant\n... I really had no idea it was a scam until today?\n\n(b) What evidences do I need? (The lady who got scammed told me she was ready to cooperate incase I needed evidence if I reported to the police)\n\nPlease guide me. I need some serious legal advice.\n\ntl;dr worked in a scam indian call centre for a month and just realized now\n\n(sorry for my terrible grammar)\n\nEDIT1 - Karl Rock has replied to my email yesterday and is willing to help. I've shared with him the address, name, phone number and other details of the call centre that I had. He said that he will reply to me soon. \n\nI'll update this post as soon as I get an update from him.",

I want to know my rights as a citizen and the law on this, in case this ever happens again.  \n  \nHey everyone!\n\nJust wanted to share a story, was walking along the road with my girl today in Navi Mumbai. We were about to reach her place so just before that I gave my girl a kiss on the cheek and that is when two cops on bikes came in.\n\nStopped, and you know the usual things that cops do. However, I was 100% sure that I was not going to falter and give in to any of their scare tactics. Partially because I know that we weren't in the wrong. They asked the usual questions, where do you stay, where does madam stay etc. Gave very generalized answers.\n\nThey asked me what do I do, I gave my profession. And then asked me, \"What to do now?\" I simply said, \"Galti ho gayi, nai hoga firse\" (Made a mistake won't happen again). Simple, stern and yet respectfully. \n\nOne of the cops acted as if he was calling the local thana of my area, but I saw the home screen on his phone (LOL). \n\nRegardless, I did not give in and we were gone within minutes. Made sure they drove off as well so that they don't follow either of us to harass later.\n\nMy question is,\n\nWhat are my rights as a citizen here? I have some idea, but I wanted to know that in such a situation what should I do and more importantly, what does the law say specifically.\n\nLooked up multiple places, had mixed responses.\n\nThanks everyone!",

He's also convinced her that he's earning a lot, but his account is blocked for another 5 years because enemies can track bank transactions and reach him.

He offered me a lifetime free credit card (I am talking about FIRT SWYP card + add on). I got suspicious, so before giving the otp I asked him to send an official email from the bank stating that this offer is lifetime free. He said that you will get all the details as soon as the process is completed.\n\nWhen the bill was generated on 17th June, I saw that it had joining fee and other charges. I immediately sent emails to the bank at nodaldesk and customer service and got the complaint registered and said If you don't reverse the joining fees (including gst) from both credit cards i will file a complaint on RBI OMBUDSMAN. The next day I got a call from that RM. He was saying that Sir, I agree with you, you do one thing, pay that bill, it will be refunded in the next month's statement. And tired of giving the same explanation every time. I told him to get all the charges refunded or else I will complain to RBI (i have a call recording of this conversation as well).i blocked his number. I felt mentally harassed. After this call, I felt that these people will not listen like this (I was scared) so I complained to RBI.\n\nOn 25th June I got a call from the idfc rm and asked for a proof. I told them that I have the call recordings as proof, they asked me to send those call recordings to banker which I sent (tbh, sending those call recordings was a headache for me). I got a call from that RM again and tired of giving the same explanation every time. I told him I DON'T HAVE MONY TO PAY YOUR CHARGES why don't you understand ?\n\nOn 27th June, I received an email from IDFC bank, this is the email \"Dear Sir, Greetings from IDFC FIRST Bank! We value your relationship with us. Thank you for your patience! We apologize for the inconvenience caused to you regarding mis-sell of credit card.\n\nWe would like to inform you that our concern team is working on your query on priority.

On that day, I woke up only to see my belongings were stolen by burglars. Apparently, my friend woke up early in the morning to go out and he forgot to lock it. I was the only one in the house that day and everything happened when I was asleep. My laptop, mobile phone, wallet and some cash were stolen that day. I immediately called the police to inform about the burglary. One police official arrived at the scene and noted down the things which were stolen and advised me to visit the nearest police station. I went to the nearby police station at Mukherjee Nagar and filed a formal complaint there. I was informed there that it will take around 2 days’ time to transfer the case to the department which will trace the phone.\r  \n\r  \nWhile the police officials were dormant, I personally went and searched for any CCTV footage which might give me an edge in the situation. And I did find one footage which clearly showed the faces of burglars. I collected the footage from the nearby residence and immediately forwarded it to police officials. Even after that, there was no proper response from the police officials. \r  \n\r  \nLater that night at around 9.30pm, I received a notification on my other phone of the current location of my stolen mobile phone. The location was a Vi retail store which is situated at Vasanth Vihar which is 20kms away from where the burglary happened. I immediately forwarded the location to IO who was appointed earlier that evening. But he absolutely refused to visit the store and said it is a fake location and went on to say that he won't be knocking random doors. Thereafter, I visited the location myself and I found out 2 local police officials nearby and on asking their help just to visit the store, they refused it and said I should go by myself. I went to the store personally but it was locked. I went to the police officials again, requested them to assist but they once again refused to offer any help. With no option left, I had to head back home. \r  \n\r  \nNext day, I visited the nearby police station where the store was situated but they refused to assist stating that my case is not under their jurisdiction. After this until now, it is just talks and nothing. It has been one and a half month since the incident happened. I provided them with pictures and CCTV footage of burglars, and further provided them a credible location where my mobile phone was but even after all this, nothing happened from their part. The incompetence of the police department is mind boggling especially in the capital city of India and I even provided them with credible evidences to solve my case. As of now, I have no hope of this case getting solved.\r  \nMy question to you is, is there anything a person can do in this case?\r  \n\r  \nNote: Added images of culprits in the comments.

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m in a difficult situation and need some advice. I filed a civil case for a property dispute, and my lawyer asked me to pay a percentage of the property value as a court fee. This amounted to around 5 lakhs, which we paid.\n\nFor the past year, I’ve been repeatedly asking my lawyer for the receipt for this fee, but he keeps ignoring me. Whenever he does send something, he deletes his messages on WhatsApp.\n\nNow, we’re switching to a new lawyer for the case, and the old lawyer claims that the 5 lakhs we paid is his fee (not the court fee). We've already paid him 1 lakh as his fee, and when I made the payment of 5 lakhs, I mentioned it was for the court fee.\n\nWe’re really stuck here, and it’s becoming difficult to travel and deal with this situation. Does anyone have advice on what I can do in this case? \n\nThanks for any help!\n\n",

Now after almost 4 months of leaving the organisation and joining another one j got served with a notice that I need to pay them 3,700,000.

I am from India if that helps.\n\nI do have screenshots and call logs confirming that they requested me to do their work even after I had resigned and never asked me for systems and no one contacted me to inform me about anything else.\n\n\nSo basically it happened in August i resigned with 30 days notice and left, at that time they hadn't paid me for June July August, I left and they paid me for June but july and august is still pending. I sent them emails for this and I had their assets, no action and no response. They asked me to complete certain tasks for them during sept Oct and then I joined new organisation in nov.\nAnd now they have sent me this notice that as I had resigned in August and worked in sept and Oct on their assets and they claim they never approved this work I am liable to pay this amount as they have had financial loses",

        "text": "Long-time lurker, first-time poster. I (29M) got married (to 29F) in March earlier this year, and it was over by mid-April. We had planned to proceed with a mutual consent divorce and were waiting out the 1-year period till March 2025, however, we have recently been told about the possibility of getting an annulment, so thought we'd get an opinion from the community (its legality in India, feasibility and the like). \n\nKey points, which I've included a few of because I'm not sure which one might end up being relevant:\n\n1. Both officially Hindus, but married under Special Marriage Act, 1991. There was no ceremony of any kind. \n\n2. It was a love marriage, we'd been dating for 6 years. Some facts came to light in April, a few weeks after the registration which made continuing the marriage untenable. \n\n3. Registration was executed in a jurisdiction (it was our hometown) which is different from the one we are currently staying in. (EDIT: We reside in Bangalore, forgot to mention this in the original post)\n\n4. We do not, and never have, lived with either set of parents. We've always lived in a different city than our families. \n\n5. We're both financially independent with me earning slightly more than her the last few months. There are NO KIDS, NO SHARED ASSETS (not even a joint bank account, our finances were always separate), and NO JOINT LOANS. There's literally nothing to share custody of. I understand that the jewelery my parents bought her during the registration process would constitute Streedhan, and I'm willing to let that go. \n\n6. Both of us are aligned on the idea of \"ripping the band-aid off as quickly as possible\", with minimal complications, and moving on with our lives. \n\nKeeping the discussion *purely legal*, we're looking for inputs with respect to the following points:\n\n1. Legality: Is an annulment even a thing/permitted in India? \n2. Feasibility: Is it an accepted practice? What's the success rate of getting this?\n3. Logistics: Can we hire one lawyer to represent both of us since there's no conflict (extended question: can we do this in case we go for a mutual consent divorce later if annulment doesn't work out?). What about the jurisdiction, can we get it transferred to the city we're currently living in in case we have court appearances for the annulment? \n\nThank you to everyone in advance, your help would be very appreciated.

        "text": "Yesterday, while driving from Rewari to Delhi on NH8 with my wife for Rakshabandhan, I encountered a troubling situation near Dharuhera. Three young men on a Splendor bike caught my attention. They were furiously honking and yelling, behaving like madmen. I believe they noticed my wife sitting beside me and started their antics after seeing a woman in the car. Both my wife and I are young—I'm 27, and she's 25.\n\nAt first, I wasn't sure if their behavior was directed at us, but their incessant honking made me decide to let them overtake. As they passed, they came dangerously close to my wife's side of the car and gave her weird looks before yelling again. This made me furious, so I accelerated and pulled up close to them. I shot them an angry look and said a few words in frustration, though they probably couldn’t hear me since they were on a bike and I was in the car going about 70 km/h.\n\nMy wife urged me to ignore them, so I decided to speed up and overtake them. But then I noticed they were chasing us and yelling for us to stop. I kept driving because we were outnumbered, and I had my wife with me. I was driving at 100 km/h on a road that was quite busy at the time. After a few kilometers, I saw they were no longer behind us.\n\nHowever, near Bilaspur Chowk, where there is ongoing construction on the overhead bridge, traffic slowed down. Suddenly, those three guys appeared from the service lane, stopped, and one of them picked up a stone. He threw it at the window on my wife's side, intending to hurt her and damage the car. As I saw this happening, I accelerated, and the stone hit the lower window panel, missing the glass. Then, the same guy picked up another stone and smashed the rear glass panel of our car, shattering it. I could hear him shouting curses.\n\nI looked at my wife, and she was panicked. We tried calling 112 three times, but it didn't connect. I decided to leave the situation as quickly as possible, so I sped off. Unfortunately, everything happened so fast that we couldn't note down the bike's number. We reached Panchgaon in a panicked state and decided to file a complaint. However, due to the lack of the bike's number, we are not receiving much help from the police.\n\nThis incident was very traumatizing, and it's making me question our safety and the safety of women in general. It feels like there’s no point in talking about women’s safety when things like this can happen so easily.",

The counter, however, was \"closed\" 5 minutes before I reached, and the Duty Manager, refused to assist. He was rude, dismissive, and belittled me in public.\n\nHe denied me a pass because I was '5 mins' late to the counter. I would not have needed to visit the counter in the first place had I not been put on waitlist. I called the Airline help number, they didn't help. I requested 2 other staff members. They neither helped nor offered me an alternate flight.\n\nAir India's call support admitted the overbooking error but was unhelpful. This ordeal caused me financial loss, stress, and humiliation. I had to shell out another 15k booking an Indigo flight since it was a clost friends' wedding I did not want to miss.\n\nThe lack of accountability and basic customer service was shocking.

I eventually moved to a different room and started sleeping alone. I’m 23 now and i’m still pretty uncomfortable even being in the same room as him. But now, he accused my mom of cheating on him when she went out with a female friend ( funniest part is he was the one who dropped her off at the friends house).

        "text": "So my sister (27F) lend money to her boyfriend (maybe 33/35M) without informing our parents. The total amount is 15 lakh. First she got loan from the bank of 10 lakh and gave to him. Date came near to pay back, boyfriend didn’t have money, sister got call to give back money in three days or else they’ll come to get her. Sister got scared and asked my uncle for help, uncle being a good brother informed my dad about it. Dad asked about it to my sister to why she took a loan of this big amount and she lied and said she took it for her bestfriend to help her for her wedding. Dad gave 10 lakh to her from his savings, she paid back the loan.\n\nThen one day dad checks statement of my sister’s bank account and comes to know that she’s taken a 5 lakh loan too. Confronts her in front of mom and me, still she lies that she’s taken it for her bestfriend wedding. Mom and dad tell her to call her bestfriend (let’s call her Y) and talk to her on speaker, she denies and tells about her being at office but my parents had had enough, she makes the call my sister asks Y about when she was returning her money and guess what she said!! “Konse paise?” At this point we were furious and to that my sister says “saare hee. Mere ghar peh ab pata chal Gaya hai.” Y says okay and hangs up. Parents are more than angry at this point and my sister cries and tells them to give her Y a month to return back the money, they agree.  After 1-2 hours I get a call from Y, and she tells me that the money wasn’t for her but was for my sister’s boyfriend and tells me that my sister’s crazy about him. \n\nMind you that my sister doesn’t know that her friend called me and told me the truth. After I confront her she comes clean and starts crying about how bad his health was and was hospitalised and had some kind of replacement operation (don’t remember what kind) and he had no money (his mother is a widow and they’re two sons, youngest is in college I guess) to pay nor his friends were lending him money so my sister being the one with big heart lent it to him.\n\nWe had to pay back the 5 lakh loan and my father didn’t have that kind of money so my mom had to sell her jewellery and paid back. Few days back I asked my sister if we are even going to get back the money and she says he will return it but how and when she doesn’t know because now they don’t talk much. And because of that I asked her to give me his number called him on phone and it was switched off , sister says to call on WhatsApp but he doesn’t pick and messages me that he’ll call in an hour and never received a call back so I call him again the other day and he says that he can’t talk as it is raining heavily, I ask him about the connection between calling me back and heavy rains to that he says that he can’t talk at home comfortably so for that he has to go out and as it is raining he can’t talk. Today I call him again and he says that he’ll definitely call me and “as I also need to talk to you” his exact words. Waiting game is on. \n\nNow they don’t trust her with money or anything. Dad has been having sleepless nights and his sugar spiked up. That one month is coming to an end in few days and I’m losing my sh*t. Please guide us about what to do now because all of this is affecting my parents, sister and me. ",

        "text": "Before you leave comments like 'you are a shitty cousin, your family is toxic, etc' I would like to point out that my family is not on talking terms with them for decades as they were always problematic. This post is to help others going through a separation and to know what to expect legally and socially.\n\nMy cousin, 31M is from a wealthy family. His father started a real estate business and their net worth is around 70-85cr. They started looking for a bride for 3 years when he was 28-29 and they found nobody. Reasons - he found the women too modern, and high maintenance and the women who wanted to be homemakers still wanted a maid and cook. Eventually, the family changed their strategy to looking for girls from small towns/villages. He married a 21-year-old who was straight out of college. Reasons - innocent, middle class, has no career aspirations, fair and slim. During the wedding my aunt actively went around bitching about this girl to close relatives that her father didn't have anything to give them, dowry basically and that they were forced to make the marriage happen because my cousin was getting old.\n\nFor the next 3 years of their marriage, they lived together since it was already agreed upon at the time of marriage that living separately was not an option since his parents pay all the bills. They expected her to cook despite them being rich enough to afford a maid. They would complain that she is using their money to pay for her expenses, they were expecting her parents to give her money. They didn't see why she should have a job as they didn't need her money. After 1 year of the marriage, they started forcing her to pregnant, this was including the husband.\n\nThis was going on for 3 years. This year she informed her parents and they stepped in and asked her to adjust. When she said she is going to walk out they finally decided to have a divorce conversation with the family. The family has assured everything is in their name and not the son's name so nothing will be given to her. I also know they are **hiding how much property they own** as they have always used all the tricks in the book to acquire more property over the years. When it comes to alimony their reasoning was he gets paid from the company so only that is counted(it's a 50k range salary) and they are also refusing to give the divorce because they don't want to lose any of their wealth. The poor girl is stuck with a toxic family and her family trying to make her adjust as this family is refusing to proceed with the divorce. Lastly, to make their case better, my cousin's family is going around telling all our relatives that she is bipolar and that they have been cheated.\n\nWhen you decide to walk out, check everything secretly, gather funds and then get a good lawyer as soon as possible!",

        "title": "120 Days of Silence: Suspended, Banned & Stranded for Speaking Up",
        "text": "\n\nIt has been 120 days since I was suspended. 120 days of 95% radio silence. No clarity, no communication—just a career put on indefinite hold because a major Indian airline decided to punish me for replying to a colleague’s WhatsApp message.\n\nI have not leaked confidential information. I have not insulted the company. I have not done anything that puts their name in jeopardy. But I have been banned from the airport, not allowed to return to my hometown, and left in professional limbo—all because I dared to have a conversation.\n\nHow It Started:\n\nThe real issue? I raised concerns about the company’s room-sharing policy.\n\nFor those who don’t know, the airline forces cabin crew to share hotel rooms during layovers. It doesn’t take a genius to see why this is a terrible idea. There have been cases of theft, harassment, and even smuggling linked to this practice. Every crew member knows the risks, but the management refuses to acknowledge them.\n\nI used official channels to report my concerns. No response. I tried again. Still nothing. The system is designed to ignore complaints so that the airline never has to take responsibility.\n\nSo, when I discussed the issue in a private WhatsApp group with colleagues, I wasn’t doing anything radical—I was just looking for support from people who understood. And that’s when they decided to come after me.\n\nThe “Charges” Against Me:\n\n\t1.\tNot maintaining “high standards” of work ethic and conduct.\n\t•\tBecause questioning an unsafe policy is apparently unprofessional.\n\t2.\tNot adhering to company policies and SOPs.\n\t•\tEven though nothing I did violated any actual policy.\n\t3.\tCommitting acts “prejudicial” to the company’s interests.\n\t•\tIf pointing out safety risks is against the company’s interests, what does that say about them?\n\t4.\tInsubordination, inciting disruption, breaching law.\n\t•\tTheir biggest lie—that I organized a “mass sick leave” protest. Reality? I actively discouraged it. But they twisted my words, removed the context, and turned it into an excuse to get rid of me.\n\nThe “Inquiry”—If You Can Even Call It That:\n\n\t•\tCross-examination? Denied. Because why allow fairness when you can just declare someone guilty?\n\t•\tEvidence? Out of context, manipulated, misinterpreted.\n\t•\tKey questions? Ignored. Because the answers wouldn’t fit their narrative.\n\t•\tUnderstanding how WhatsApp works? Nonexistent. The inquiry officer thought a pinned message was a “heading” and used it as proof of my intent. This is the level of “expertise” deciding my career.\n\t•\tCode of Conduct? Only enforced when it suits them. The same principles they preach about fairness, transparency, and protection from retaliation? Completely ignored when it’s inconvenient for them.\n\nThe Reality:\n\nI have not leaked anything. I have not defamed the company. I have not done anything illegal. Yet I’ve been treated like a criminal—stuck in a city I don’t belong to, unable to return home, banned from my workplace, and left in a void of silence.\n\n120 days. No proper explanation. No fair trial. No closure. Just silence.\n\nThis isn’t about policy violations. This isn’t about misconduct. This is about a company using its power to silence employees who dare to question its flawed systems.\n\nThey are dragging this out, knowing the financial and mental toll it takes. They are waiting for me to break, to give up, to disappear quietly. But I refuse.\n\nIf this is how they treat someone who simply spoke up about safety, imagine what else they’re hiding.",

        "text": "Hello people, I’m sure you’ve heard of this case by now and let’s go through it again. Kindly correct me with the exact or updated details since this is what I have so far. Also this post comes with a solution I was thinking about so let me know what do you think?\n\nWe'll discuss the case of Vedant Agarwal, his actions, the aftermath, and what we can do to bring about change.\n\nSection 1: Incident Overview\n\nVedant Agarwal, the 17-year-old son of Vishal Agarwal, a well-known builder and owner of Brahma Realty, recently celebrated passing his 12th exams by going to a pub. He drove his family's unregistered Porsche Taycan, a car they had owned for just a month, and unfortunately, this night of celebration turned into a nightmare.\n\nSection 2: The Accident\n\nVedant consumed alcohol at the pub, which was clearly captured on CCTV cameras, but chose to drive home. He ended up speeding at 150 km/h or more, which led to a tragic accident around 3 AM, killing two young IT employees, Ashwini Koshta, 25, and Anish Awadhiya, 24. Both were not local to Pune; Ashwini was from Jabalpur and Anish from Madhya Pradesh, having studied engineering here.\n\nSection 3: Legal Proceedings\n\nNow, let's talk about the legal side. Vedant was arrested that night, but thanks to the efforts of a notable lawyer, Prashant Patil, he secured bail within 15 hours. Patil has an interesting history, having represented high-profile clients like Sooraj Pancholi, Ajit Pawar, and others. The bail came with conditions: Vedant had to write a 300-word essay on the accident, work for 15 days in traffic planning, and seek treatment for his alcohol condition, including a psychiatric consultation\n\nSection 4: Additional Arrests and Actions\n\nThe police also took further actions. Vedant's father, Vishal Agarwal, was arrested. The pub where Vedant drank was sealed, and its owner and manager were arrested for serving alcohol to a minor.\n\nSection 5: Comparative Analysis\n\nThis incident reminds us of a similar case in the USA involving Cameron Herrin, an 18-year-old who was sentenced to 24 years in prison for killing a mother and her baby by overspeeding a Ford Mustang. The comparison is not to say that one country is better than the other, but to highlight how a developed country deals with such crimes with stricter repercussions.\n\nSection 6: The Systemic Issue in India\n\nIndia, on the other hand, is still a developing nation, and unfortunately, our system often bends the rules for the wealthy. This reality means that those with money can often escape the full consequences of their actions.\n\nSection 7: Defeating Capitalism with Capitalism\n\nSo, what can we do about this? Here's a thought: let's defeat capitalism with capitalism. Instead of just blaming the system, let's come together as a nation. If each one of us contributes just one rupee, we could pool together a significant amount of money to hire top-notch lawyers who can fight these cases for us. India’s population is over 1.4 billion, and with 23.7 million Twitter users, we have the numbers to make a difference.\"\n\nSection 8: Impact and Unity\n\nBy doing this, we send a powerful message. Wealthy individuals will think twice before bending the rules, knowing that the public can and will challenge them. The government will also feel the pressure to enforce stricter actions against such crimes. This unity can bring us together as a community, standing up for what is right.\n\nSection 9: Conclusion and Final Thoughts\n\nLet's honor the legacy of our freedom fighters and great leaders by taking action.

Whenever I asked for breakup, she would complain about having breathing problems, anxiety attacks etc (she has Borderline Personality, OCD, major depressive episode). Finally we both agreed to have a breakup and meet for the last time. We decided to not have sex. We booked a room for some privacy. But after a while after checking in, she started demanding alcohol, I said no but she was being adamant about it, and I yielded. She brought Vodka and made me drink as well while later we made out. Later things spiced up and we had sex. After checking out I asked her about breakup and she said it's done.\nThe next day, she thinks she might get pregnant (although we used a condom), to which I said, I'll marry her if she gets pregnant. \nWe later met for the last time and decided to go for a pregnancy test, it came negative. She wanted to have sex with me one night before the test and also after the test. Both times I declined. She got mad at me. We separated our ways.\nNow a month later, she's threatening me that if I don't marry her she'll file a rape case against me. That a drunk girl cannot legally consent and it was rape. \nIs she correct?",

        "text": "me(M34) and girl(F33) met a year ago in the US.\n\nGirl came to the US from India for her masters a few years back and I met her through matrimonial website. I have been in the US for over 10 years now, and this girl as she said in the beginning was 'awaiting on her divorce' with her husband in India.  \nInitially **according to the girl**,  \nShe got married in India in 2016 and applied for divorce the next year after her marriage based on fake salary of her husband. She made a lot of stories about why her divorce is still awaiting and that it's in the high court of the state now. She was well behaved with me, but I did feel something strange about her and her family since beginning. I did not promise her anything but then she had walked away on her own a few months ago.  \nNow, **according to the same girl**,  \nShe called back me and asks me to be with her and marry her.  \nNow she confesses that her family and the lawyers had forced her to file a false 498A against her husband back then and she had given all statements to court like he beat her up, removed her from home, and more(pretty common in India these days to make their fake 498A sound legit in court). And, the guy won the 498A years go. She mentioned that her husband doesn't want to divorce her now yet and is seeking revenge from her father by postponing her marriage here. she claims he(her husband) is asking for $$ from her US income now. She was also trying to pressurize me for marriage even before her divorce gets finalized in India.\n\nI am just confused, I have no idea what the hell is going on back there in India but these girls are on the way to ruin a lot of things for other men everywhere. I am NOT going to entertain this girl at any cost, as I love my life, family and career more than this crap.  \nMy question is- how real this story could be? could there there be more to this? did I do anything wrong here? She has some of our pics together, she keeps calling me and texting me even when I don't respond. Tbh, she did not seem like anything like she could have done all this stuff. . Luckily, I live very far from her city and I haven't went too deep into emotions due to her abandoning behavior. I learned- do not trust them easily!!\n\nAny advice?\n\n\n\n\nEdit/Thanks:\nI am grateful for everything you guys said. I am glad I took a validation from here :-) \nShe ain’t the right fit for me, I just wanted to know what I am thinking is right or wrong. \n\nI blocked her!! \nI should be more careful hereafter as I read all the comments. \nI hope she doesn’t keep troubling me from other sources. \nThank you 🙏 ",

        "text": "So I've known this girl through social media and we've been in a Long Distance relationship for a few months. We haven't met physically even once. She lives in Indore and I live in Bangalore.\n\nShe's 23, has completed her masters and has gotten admission in IIT Bombay for PhD, which is a pretty big deal. I'm 29 and I run a small business in Bangalore.\n\nNow, a couple of weeks ago, her mom caught her talking to me, atleast that's what she told me. All hell broke loose and her parents started verbally assaulting her since. Yesterday, when she told her dad that she wants to book her train tickets to Bombay, her dad and mom both physically assaulted her. They kicked her and hit her with a belt. Then they locked her in her room and she's locked while I write this post.\n\nAll this while since they caught her, they've been trying to force her into a marriage. She even met some guy's parents last Sunday. She's been very depressed about all this. Sh barely eats anything and rarely gets out of the bed.\n\nI've been telling her to just somehow just get into IIT as soon as possible. I've no intention of kidnapping her or getting her to Bangalore. I'm even ready to breakup with her as long as she safely lands in Bombay to do her course. IIT Bombay people have told her that she can join the campus on 15th August.\n\nI've asked her to try to run away from her house somehow and get to IIT as soon as possible. She has a guy friend in Mumbai who can help her stay somewhere till 15th.\n\nMy concern is if she actually runs away from her house, can her parents file a case against me for asking her to run away? Like a kidnapping case or something? I'm also not helping her financially and have told her to book everything from her own money. I've also told her to file a complaint with National Commission for Women to be on the safer side. Also, have told her to make a video detailing her assault from her room.\n\n**Questions -**\n\n1. Can I get into any kind of legal trouble for helping like this? If yes, what can I do to protect myself.\n2. What else can she do to ensure her parents can't take her back to Indore from Mumbai? Finding a lawyer is difficult for her though.",

        "title": "Father died due to carelessness and hiding of facts, medical negligence by Oscar Hospital Charkop",
        "text": "My (32F)  father (72M) was admitted at Oscar Hospital, Charkop, Malad, Mumbai **(Google: Oscar Hospital Malad** ) ICU in Feb 2022, due tobreathlessness ( 70% SPO2 ) which was reported as pneumonia to me. He walked up 1 floorin his condition since there was no lift and the ground staff was too slow to get a wheelchair / stretcher.\n\nOn admission, I made all his medical history clear, even gave them all his existing medicine box, dosage everything.  On day 2 he showed signs of confusion and other problems which I notifiedto the ICU doctors which they considered normal. On day 3 they did pleural tapping to remove fluid builtup around his lungs. Initially the said, this could be due to heart issue, covid and whatnot and finally saying it is pneumonia.\n\nHe appeared confused and mumbling before the fluid removal procedure and they still continued with it. After the procedure, My father went into a state where he was trying to get off the hospital bed ( the reasons I understood 10 days later ) and was agitated the whole time.\n\nSince the agitations were not in control, they did try some medication which was not revealed to me.I overheard the ICU doctor trying to purchase some banned medication at the inhouse medical store.My father was asleep for straight 20 hours or so 1 day and on asking why, ICU doctor said it was normal sleep, chest doctor said it was medicated. I think it was induced coma to control the agitation.During this whole time I was not allowed to visit him and was allowed only a glance saying his agitation will increase on meeting me. All this time since a day after agitations started they tried to keep pushing me to take him out of the ICU, inface even wrote a letter on my behalf saying I am requesting him out of ICU on my own responsibility.  I obviously didnt sign and demanded explanation, after that they let him be in the ICU.\n\nAfter the long sleep when my father woke up, his agitation was controlled, but he kept talking random stuff in between. Physically he showed stroke symptoms, unable to walk properly, balance being greatly affected. Ability to swallow was compromised. He also suffered from Parkinson and was on medication for it for years. However, his medication allowed him to do his activities freely. He used to even wake up at 5 AM everyday, exercise and do work around the house. Instead of revealing that the treatment they tried led to this, the hospital told me it is because his Parkinson medication is stopped.\n\nAfter this I moved him to general ward, never did they mention that he is in a dangerous situation, infact I wasn't allowed to freely access his medical file saying it is against rules. I was not given honest update about his condition. Infact his kidney had started to fail but they didn't inform me. I was puzzled the whole time by seeing his medication list which had medicines for everything. Even simple questions like did he pass stool etc. was not informed. I used to try to feed my father, but he would say his stomach feels full, so I would ask the nurse if he has passed stool the reply I got one day was \"Why dont you ask him only?\" Since my father was also confused sometimes, I was not sure if his answer was reliable.  \n\n\nSince, they kept mentioning Parkinson as the core of his problems, I asked them to get in touch with my father's neurologist of 5 years. They kept declining and saying he should get in touch with him. I finally asked a medical status report so I can personally visit the neurologist for 2nd opinion.   \nThe neuro said that, sometimes the hospitals get cautious that you are looking for a loophole lawsuit so maybe that why they weren't transparent. My intention was not at all like that I was trying to get into details so I can know about the situation. I was a little relaxed after the neuro conversation. On hindsight, he did feel things were not proper looking at the reports but he probably felt it was best to not interfere with the line of treatment.  \n\n\nAfter 10 days of hospitalisation, they discharged him saying he is doing better and his lung condition has improved and he is able to maintain 90% SPO2 on discharge. The senior doctor doing his rounds referred to my father as brain damage patient ( there was no other such patient in the 10-12 bed general ward ) while I was standing away.\n\nNever at any point, I pushed for discharge,  I was willing to keep him there till he got better. But they kept prodding me to take him home saying he is better. On the day of his discharge, I asked the doctor why his movements are still not proper, food intake, stool issues. Blood report showed increasing infection. They kept hiding facts, saying he will gradually become better, convincing he will get better and discharged him.\n\nThe whole time I was getting this feeling that something else was happening contrary to what I am seeing. The medical as well as non medical staff, I kept overhearing conversations that somehow aligned with my father's situation and pointed to critical situation, but the doctors kept saying they are managing. It was like everyone else had an idea about it except me.\n\nAfter getting him home on 9th March night, his health started deteriorating the next evening. Since there were no red flags from the hospital I decided to wait and see how it goes.\n\nIntially he was eating, tried to walk ( like a recovering stroke patient ) and I felt like my father was back with me. However gradually his movements got slow, stopped passing urine. At this stage his kidney was probably damaged. He got confused and stopped eating and responding by 12th Morning. His BP had dipped at this point. Me being a non medico didnt understand the significance of this.\n\nI rehospitalised him in another hospital on 12th March since he stopped being able to lift his arms or reply to me. The 2nd hospital on admission told me he was in sepsis and very critical and has been the case since many days.\n\nNow when I look back, the confusion was the sign of sepsis on day 2 at Oscar Hospital.Agitation, confusion and slow organ damage are all signs of sepsis. In order to control that they probably put him in induced coma ( long sleep ) after which his brain got damaged a bit. They gave him cognitive boosters but somehow it seems the sepsis started again. On the day of discharge he has started coughing again and on asking they said it is due to Air conditioning.\n\nIn the 2nd hospital, from 12th March to 16th March my father was in the ICU without responding to us. Each day he suffered and I suffered looking at him in this state. I lost him on 16th March 2022.\n\nI want to know what to do for this. Oscar Hospital made my father suffer deeply and I not a daygoes without me thinking about this. I have no siblings and I lost my mother a decade ago so everyone around me is asking me to move on. I donot want any monetary compensation but I want the hospital to be affected.\n\nI have thought of complaining to Mahrastra Medical Council.  I am not sure I want to go the lawyer route, since the hospital will probably have a stronger group.\n\nBut I really donot know how I can go ahead with my life knowing that my enthusiastic, supporting father suffered so much inspite of me doing everything I could when he was hospitalised. For a long time I wondered why they did that, is it because I was managing alone over there and rest family and friends used to visit and leave. I was the one managing the funds and overseeing his whole treatment. I am an adult who walked up 1 flight of stairs along with breathless father to hospitalize him. In the end I realised they probably didn't because they messed up and tried to hide this. That was the reason they kept asking me what I do, what domain I work in etc. if I was a medico etc during the whole hospitalization\n\nI have some videos of his hospitalisation, and voice recordings of my conversation with the doctor.At that point I did all this so I can send the same to family friends who used to enquire about his health.\n\nThere are many more details that point to the shady and deliberate attempt from the hospital side to hide the criticality of the situation. **Ill try to add those details.**\n\nCan someone guide me what to do here? Is this under medical negligence?",

However, I want to shield my parents, friends and any person who has ever been remotely in my contact, from any involvement in my case whatsoever, to preserve their social reputation from getting involved in such a case. \n\nSince, I'm a lad ushering in my early 20s, my departure would definitely spark an intense investigation, barraging my friends and family with scrutiny. I shall clearly state in my last note, to spare my kith and kin from any interrogation, especially my parents who're marginally responsible in pushing me towards this. What can I do to make them legally immune, also expiate them monetarily by the state if possible. \n\nAlso, please don't try to convince me to rather live, or contact a mental health professional (which I've already had). My fate has a put me in an inextricable situation, with literally no way out. \n\nEdit 1: I'm giving a brief description of my inextricable situation as asked by many. I've tried everything, visiting multiple docs including psychiatrists, neurologists and gastros + plus my mind has been damaged to a point of beyond repair, that coupled with a toxic family makes it all the way worse. I've been a guinnie pig for all possible treatments available. My parents have ran out of money and aren't willing to spend a penny more. I've been a state level champion, my work recognised by Cambridge and Microsoft, and now being thrown into an odd job paying a few thousand bucks, which literally 0 possibility of ever getting back into my domain (engineering) with this heavily damaged mind. It's better to die than live like a pauper, stripped off your identity and potential.\n\nEdit 2: I'm not doing it impulsively or anytime soon, but thanks for the concern. It's still my last option when I've exhausted all possibilities, and there are few rays of hope left thankfully.\n\nEdit 3: I'm overwhelmed with your concern for this random internet stranger. I've tried responding to as my DMs as I could. This is certainly now what I expected, but thank you!! I'm not killing myself impulsively as I said, and I am in contact with a mental health professional and a group of good friends to talk to. I've got another appointment coming up, and will keep you updated on the status of my decision. Thank you once again!!\n\nThank you!",

I managed to convince him to call my brother from his phone, to audio record our conversation. He continuously said that I am warning you, you better make the payment. When I said I don't want it and I will call the customer support ,he said they can't do shit. Later I found out he was telling me the truth, swiggy customer support is the worst. They said that they have registered my complaint but they can't give me refund. I clearly sent them audio recording of our conversation but they just won't give me my refund. Now I think that they must be doing this shit with many other people. And many other people would be willing to pay them extra money just to save there order money. So it can happen with us well they would just deduct your money and will not help you after saying that they don't see any option to file your complain because it is a unique complaint.",

        "title": "Girl threatens to commit suicide if I won’t talk to her",
        "text": "I M(29) had a match with a girl on Bumble F(29). We had very normal Hai-Bye conversations in the beginning. One day I asked her if she wanted to meet, I told it’s just a a casual drive meet and we both met around 11:00 pm and were talking in my car. We shared our interests and I told her right now I’m not looking for any relationship but if the vibe matches I am open to have an open casual relationship, she was also fine with it and was also looking for something casual. That very night while have conversations the chemistry kicked off and I asked a kiss she agreed to it and we kissed. Later we met one other time and this time we were physical, I asked her if she is comfortable with it she insisted that she wanted to experience the physical connection and she herself insisted on having unprotected sex. All went well and the other day I asked her if she is okay and if she is sure about not being pregnant, she said is won’t get pregnant. We were having a chat and suddenly she started saying, she wants to experience a 6 months relationship because she was never in a relationship. I was strictly against it as we discussed it to be casual and I did not have time and mental health to be in a committed relationship at the moment. \n\nShe stared to say that she is a cancer patient and she is just going to live for couple more days and hence she wanted to experience a relationship. I was very guilty after listening to it and said sorry and told her I did not have such feelings towards her and it would not be correct to even stay friends after what ever we did and she having feeling because that would hurt her even more. Conversation went very awkward real fast and now she started pleading me and not sure why she asked me if I am going to unfriend her and started taking screenshots (we were talking over Snapchat, hence I got to know ). I felt a bit suspicious and unfriended her. \n\nAfter 2 days I get a message from an unknown number stating she committed suicide and her health condition was critical. Her cousins spoke to me and asked me that I should send her a request by the time she comes into conscious it might make her happy to see my message. In a state of panic I did what ever I was asked to.\n\nNow we are talking again I am trying to get her back to a normal mental state. she is now saying she doesn’t love but likes me but at the same time says that she was insecure about her body and wants to get physical again to know if she can satisfy a man. To which I clearly denied, now she is thinking I was not happy getting physical with her and she doubting her body and wants to commit suicide again. \n\nI have been having this conversation with her since 2 months and almost everyday she says if you stop talking I will commit suicide. It is mentally killing me. I didn’t want another person to hurt themselves but at the same time I am not able to constantly take this mental pressure.\n\nShe is not okay to go to therapy, not okay to talk to her parents, she won’t let her friends meet her. She stays in an apartment all by herself, I’m constantly on the watch of her messages and daily chat feels like walking in a landmine field.\n\nI wanted to take police assistance but she is from a filthy rich family and she has contacts at DGP level. So she says if her name comes out she will commit suicide for sure😓\n\n\nUpdate : One of her brothers friend over heard all of the conversations that I and her cousin were having and couldn’t really see me being mentally pressured. He called me and asked me to meet in person. I met him today, He confronted that there is no cousin, the girl whom I met on bumble was talking to talking to me as if she is her cousin. Because I was talking to this cousin since the day she said she committed suicide there was no suicide which was attempted earlier as well.\n\nI feel I’m the most dumbest person on this planet, I’m just not able to digest that fact since morning. 😓😓\n\nI know this topic might no longer be relevant to this group but is there anything I should still be worried about ? I have decided to not respond to her texts or calls from now on.\n",

(She did this multiple times today)\n\nI was taken a back a little, but I didn't pay any heed at that time, then she started throwing small talks and how she feels \"nice\" touching me, watching porn and stuff (just general seduction talks). So in short, she was trying to seduce me and me being a piece of shit, got seduced. I didn't touch her even when she was provoking me to because I was scared.\n\nShe has worked in our house since a long time and doesn't have a husband or kids FYI.\n\nTbh, the only reason I didn't follow along is because I have 0 experience in all this and I was scared of STD because of no rubber, If I had condoms, I would have 100% gone ahead.  \nMy real scare would be if I did the act and I come back with a rape/molestation allegation.\n\nAfter she left, I had my post nut clarity and felt extremely worried and was shaking, what she did was extremely inappropriate and me who did nothing and went along felt even more so.\n\nSo, my brain is right now split into 2, ofc there is one side which screams to go with the flow, the other one says its too risky. \n\nCan someone help me with possible legal issues which might appear if I choose to do any of the 2?The entire power play seems to be with her.  \nI am really scared that if I reject after showing signs of \"interest\" (which was just my brain being horny), she might put a molestation charge against me. (I swear to god, I have not touched her inappropriately in any way, I am too much of a virgin to do that)  \nAnd if I go ahead with doing \"it\" with her, I might end up being blackmailed for things.\n\nThe biggest scare I have is having a false rape charge against me.\n\nAlso, please don't call me a shit guy, I already feel disgusted with myself.\n\nThanks.",

        "text": "I purchased an Unacademy VIP subscription in morning of feb 21 paying ₹12,000 via UPI. I confirmed with salesperson that batch will work on my ipad and will be activated immediately after money is paid. After the payment, I received the invoice, but my batch was not activated. I placed countless calls to customer support, but there was no proper response. More than 24 hours later, on Feb 22(next day) evening, after multiple escalations, they finally activated my batch. \n\nOnce the batch was activated, I realized that the course was not working on my iPad(my primary device, Playback issues) When I contacted support again provided them with all the proofs, tried troubleshooting, nothing worked then they casually told me to use an Android device, which is completely unreasonable because I did not pay ₹12,000 to be forced to watch lectures on a phone.\n\nI posted about it on twitter tagging them. Later that evening, a support representative called me again. They cancelled my ICONIC subscription, which was bundled with VIP, and told me that I would be refunded. But after that no follow ups about refund, neither in return about it. Now, my ICONIC subscription is cancelled, but my VIP subscription remains active.\n\nAnother major issue is that the teachers in this batch had clearly stated that they would not be accepting students after Feb 15 because the coursework is too intensive, and it would be difficult for new students to catch up. I agree with this, yet the salesperson still sold me this batch on Feb 21, knowing I would struggle. Now, the teachers are saying that new students should just watch recorded lectures instead of attending live ones to have understanding of whats going on in class. The whole USP of this course was personal attention and live classes peer to peer. So after all this hassle, I am now being forced to pay ₹12,000 just for recorded content. The salesperson told me a complete different story. \n\nI have already filed a complaint with cybercrime and raised a grievance with Unacademy, to which they responded they will try to fix for ipad. (no dead line, no statement addressing the refund which was my main concern). I agree I have been naive here and shouldn’t have trusted sales people. I don’t know what my next step should be. What legal action can I take in this situation? I have my JEE Advanced in 80 days and all this is so mentally taxing. \n\n",

Based on my calculations, the CEO and co-founder currently owe me around ₹4 million (₹40 lakhs) in unpaid salary. This includes pending payments from the past few months.\n\nIn addition, there have been issues with excess tax deductions amounting to over ₹300,000 that have not been properly explained or rectified. I also have not been compensated for work I did at an hourly rate during my onboarding period, prior to my official start date, which was supposed to be paid as a joining bonus.\n\nI have email correspondence where the CEO and co-founder acknowledge the salary dues they owe me. However, despite this, they have not taken concrete steps to resolve the issue.\n\nIt's worth noting that the company has undergone layoffs in various departments, but my department, consisting of a team of two, has been spared. We bring in an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of ₹2 crores for the company.\n\nI suspect that the CEO and co-founder may be misusing the funds generated by my department to finance another sub-company they have started. It seems they are using the money we earn to pay the engineering team of this new venture, while neglecting to pay the salaries owed to me and my colleague.\n\nDue to these ongoing financial issues and loss of trust, I have resigned from my position. My last working day will be in about 2 months.\n\nI have repeatedly tried to discuss these payment issues with the CEO and co-founder and requested a clear timeline for when I will receive the money I am owed. However, I have not gotten a firm commitment to resolve things.\n\nAs I prepare to leave the company, what are my options for trying to recover this substantial amount of unpaid salary and compensation before my last day? I want to handle this professionally but also ensure I am paid what I am rightfully owed. Any advice for how to navigate this situation would be greatly appreciated.",

Has forced her by ALL MEANS  -physical , emotional to get her to meet the boy somehow. She's received literal death threats from her own father if she does not listen to what he wants her to do. Everyone in her family is convincing her to agree to marry him. Some of them understand that she's being wronged but have no guts to say anything in front of her father or try to even convince him. \n\nEven if this rishta will somehow go away( we've planned that she'll appear sulky,depressed in front of the boy and if she gets the chance to talk to him privately will ask him to say no on his behalf), the problem is that she'll be locked there by her father.\nShe's also not being allowed to return to Tamil Nadu for her job - irrespective of how this rishta turns out to be. Her dad will forcefully lock her in and not let her leave the house.\nBy god's grace she's somehow managed to keep her phone by her side, so I can communicate with her for now. \n\nShe has a ticket to fly from a nearby airport to Tamil Nadu in 2 weeks time.\nWe both want to spend a lifetime together and are sure about each other. My parents are also fine with this, considering her situation as well. If this info matters , we've a decent job pay with combined monthly salary of 1.6L+ and can live independently comfortably.\n\nPlease assume her dad to be affiliated with local goons and police and me just a simple corporate guy. They live in a village in Rajasthan near Kota. My home state is Maharashtra. I read in a previous post that in case of eloping, it's important to get an affidavit with local police that she's escaping on her will. But we can't go to local police there as they'll side with the father. \n\nShe's also okay with seeking legal help to get out of the house - but we're scared if in case the police do come knocking, will the police have enough power to take her from there or can the father avoid that from happening.\n\nShe asked her real brother to help her with registrating a complaint but he's also siding with her father.\n\nRequesting experienced people or any lawyer here to give some solid advice on what we can do to end up staying with each other. \n\nWhat could our options be here and what should our plan be to eventually stay together?\n\nDid not give full details of locations because scared this might reach them.\n\nThanks a lot for this sub. Will genuinely appreciate any sort of help for us.",

That’s when I found out they had installed some kind of monitoring software without informing me. Apparently, it tracks my keystrokes, websites I visit—even screenshots my screen!\n\nIt gets worse. Last week, I overheard my manager discussing my medical history with another colleague. I only shared that info with HR for insurance purposes.

But I’m not sure how to take action.\n\nHere’s what I want to know:\n\n1. Can I ask my employer to delete my personal data or stop this level of monitoring?\n2.

        "text": "Hello everyone, \nMy Father had been scammed of Rs 2 lakhs  in past hour by the fake rape case scammer. He paid the money in 4 deposit of 50k without contacting me or other family members. When my brother came to know about that he instantly stopped him and told him about the scam. Now they have gone to the police station to file a complaint.\n\nWhat can be done next? And what are the odds that the money can be recovered considering the money was transferred to some Indian accounts?\n\nThanks\n\n\nEdit 1: People who don't know how it works, I'm writing the basic outline of what happens (at least in my case). Please share with your family members too.\n\nFirst, they gather basic info like the name of the son/other close members and parents. Then they will call the parents through WhatsApp and will tell that your son is accused of fake rape case, he is with me and his phone is seized, we can help you to talk to him. Then they play the spoofed voice of the accused member which can easily be done through AI ( All you need is a voice sample of that person). This chat is real time and the spoofed voice answers the question that one asks in a crying voice (obviously parents get emotional sometimes and do not think much before acting and ask very basic questions to their non-real son on the phone which scammers can easily get data of). Now they ask to pay some money and your son will be released and then starts threatening along with the voice of the boy crying in the background.\n\nEdit 2: Adding some more details that can follow afterwards you fall for the scam.\n\nIf you give them money, they will ask for more and more. If you understand what was going on try to call them out or warn them to go to police, they abuse you and disconnect the phone. Then comes phase 2, they will again reach you out as a CBI/Cyber Cell officer and ask whether you were scammed. If you fall for it, then the cycle will repeat. They will extort some money in the name of investigation.\n\nMore or less this is the complete story of this scam.",

        "text": "My wife and I got married in Jan 2019. Prior to this we were in a relationship for past 5 years since our college. In 2021 my decided to pursue her Master's from Canada. I arranged funds and supported her in whatever way I could. The plan was that she would complete her studies and I will then join her on a work permit later.\n\nIn the meantime after about 3 months of starting her studies, she suddenly started to ignore me. The warmth in the messages that a couple share disappeared suddenly. She attributed this to her stress of studies, managing her time etc. and I supported her. The bond between us deteriorated further and her reasoning was that I couldn't be the husband she wanted (Mind you this was still early days of her moving out, prior to which there were never any hints from her except for the usual husband wife troubles). All this time I was going crazy since I wasn't able to understand what went wrong and I hadn't stopped loving her. She was still my wife, my lover, my everything! But there were no reciprocal feelings from her (needless to say the feeling that were there before she left, of love, of care). Things were so bad that she popped up the idea of divorce many times just through our telephonic coversations. I was still a naive person who was madly in lover with his wife, his college love.\n\nFast forward to when her studies got over and it was time for me to come to Canada, we decided to meet because \"that could re-kindle the love, feelings for me in her\". I left my job back in my country and arrived in Canada. Now when I was here I found out that she was sharing her apartment with an unmarried male friend from her university. This guy is still living here but I was made to believe that he's here for some days and her original \"female flatmate\" had to leave for some emergency. I was still madly in love with her, trying to re-kindle our \"special bond\" and accepted everything she said. I got suspicious of their relationship now that I was living in the same apartment, her getting cozy with him, sharing time with him happily, but getting irritated by my mere presence. I then searched her iMessages ( I know I did wrong, but if I hadn't done that, I would still be the guy trying to win her wife back because of some \"misunderstanding\"), and found a video of them sharing the bed and a text that says “muaahh” and the next text says \"sex\". Based on the conversation it was clear they were involved in the act more than once.\n\n\nI have clicked the images of those messages including a couple of pics of them roaming around (which looks casual)\n\n\nI confronted her her today and need help in deciding the next steps. I am certain that I will return to India and file for divorce but I wanted to handle this situation between families maturely without making it bad for anyone.\n\nAny advice here is sincerely appreciated!\n\nEdit: I was somehow able to read whatsapp messages and everything became clear. The other guy (Indian student too) was clearly involved here and all of my wife’s actions were either driven by him or made fun of together. So yeah, I’m going to file the highest possible charges!

Then call ended and i took my complaint number which is 10354900.\n\nAfter few mins i was contacted by constables and they were on the way to my home, it was midnight so i told them it is inappropriate time and it wont be necessary since its a case of online CP and sexual abuse.\n\nAfter 10mins i was contacted by IO(Investigating officer) and he asked for details.\n\nNext morning at 11am, IO contacted again and asked same questions and asked about what i do. I told him im a law student and as such.\n\nI called him back and asked if he even got the account of Puneet Superstar since he didnt even ask me any of ids or as such. I even told him i have his number which he uses for promotions.\n\nHe said he'll contact me in evening and its been 24hrs he didnt contact me.\n\nI called him today to ask about the status of complaint, he pretended that i wasnt audible and ended the call.

My engagement had been fixed for the past nine years to a man who didn't align with my dreams. Though I tried to make it work for two years, his persistent doubts about me due to our educational differences only deepened my resentment. Life felt like an unending journey of compromise until I crossed paths with the love of my life. With great courage, I chose to call off my impending marriage with the reason that my finance had a troubled past as a gambler with legal issues. The decision brought me to the edge of a precipice.\n\nOver the past 11 months, my life has been a relentless descent into darkness. My family, especially my mother, has subjected me to emotional torment, using words that could break even the strongest spirit. They've left me feeling like I hold no value in their eyes. I am practically under house arrest, forbidden to meet friends, cut off from the world. I spend my days drowning in tears and endless thoughts. The future remains uncertain. My parents are determined to marry me off, but I fear the darkness that may await me.\n\nI'm at a crossroads, questioning whether I should take that path or find my own way. My community's deeply ingrained attitudes add to my uncertainty. I long to escape this suffocating environment, but my parents' influence and societal pressures hold me back. I am losing my grip on sanity.\n\nAmidst this chaos, I seek solace and a glimmer of hope, a way to break free from these shackles but I don't know how?",

Later her sis bf sends me few paras of what my ex had in her mind and wanted to clear about. We did cleared it on Monday and they dropped me home as well after talking. I still cleared again and bluntly said \"My only mistake is i have fallen out of love which is not a mistake but a realisation\".

Got all the documents verified by the makemytrip visa team (Rubi was the POC). Me and my then fiancee (now wife) appeared for the visa appointment and submitted documents on April 21st. Total silence from GVCW (agency that takes documents for tourist visa and sends it to greek embassy for further processing) and the greek embassy. The next installment of payment to MMT was due on 30th may. I was really worried as there was no communication about visa processing, was really skeptical to pay the remaining half amount. Got in touch with my MakeMyTrip relationship manager (my poc for this booking) Ruchi and cried about this - that i didnt want to pay the rest as I am worried. She insisted I paid the full amount as visa will be processed - she said she knows people got greek visa recently who booked with MMT. I asked for extension if possible, she denied straight and asked me to pay or else she said the full booking would be cancelled. I paid as I was worried about loosing the already paid amount in case visa gets approved and bookings are cancelled. \nApprox around 17th of June, got my passport back with visa refusal letter with a reason: “The information submitted regarding the justification for the purpose and conditions of the intended stay was not reliable”. The documents related to booking of flights and hotels were all provided by Makemytrip. All of these documents were verified by Makemytrip visa team. Still got this refusal.\n\nI called the airline (Indigo) with the reason - they mentioned that booking can be cancelled and I can get around ₹90000 refund. Similarly I called all the hotels and they confirmed that they would refund the amount as the reason is genuine and they don’t have a problem to refund as this was almost 20days before the trip dates. All the other bookings were fully refundable as I checked the policies on individual products/service/experience websites. \nI got in touch with MMT visa team, they asked me to send the refusal letter over an email which I did. After that I got in touch with my RO (Ruchi) - she was copied in my email. After many attempts she picked up the call and said that okay I will process the cancellation - I told about the airline and hotel refunds - to which she said if that is the case I should have no problem getting my money back less some cancellation penalty. \n\nI got email from Indigo that booking has been cancelled and refund amount is approx ₹90000.\n\nAfter this Ruchi stopped responding to my whatsapp messages and stopped picking up my calls. \n\nOn July 14th Ruchi responds to my whatsapp ping and says there is no refund. \n\nI am feeling like I am scammed. MMT made me pay fully, they processed bookings, told me what documents to submit for visa - they got the refunds but I have to face big financial loss for no reason. I am not sure how I can even measure my mental trauma. This was supposed to be my honeymoon trip and it ends like this. How can makemytrip keep all this refund money?\nWill filing a consumer court complaint help? Is Voxya a good agency for raising complaint ?",

All of them are 17 years old, B is a girl and rest 2 are boys. A and B are dating.\n\nWe 4 were moving around the market aimlessly, talking and having food. That's when A thought of going to the gym(just for fun), and he also knew a bunch of people in that gym. We went there but it was full, so we decided to go to the terrace of that building. A gym staff member stopped us from going to the terrace and said we could go to the zumba hall instead which was empty, so we went there.\n\nWe talked for some minutes and then I left because I needed to buy groceries for home, C tagged along with me. Now, only A and B were in the zumba hall.\n\nI bought groceries and that's when C had an idea of randomly giving a condom to A, as a joke. I agreed so, we bought a small pack and went back to the gym. Now, this all took 15 mins and in that time A&B had gone into the second partition of hall where there are no CCTVs. I called A out from that area into the main hall and handed him the pack. He was startled, we 4 laughed and I took the pack from him, went down and threw it into the bin.\n\n5 minutes later, they gym manager called us and in the meantime B&C left for home as they live a little far. The manager showed us the CCTV and accused A of making out and me of being a condom supplier. I tried to explain him the joke but he won't take it. He also accused us of tresspassing his property and doing malicious stuff there. And the guy who sent us to the hall? the manager told that guy was just a receptionist, he has no authority to do so.\n\nNext, the manager took our mobile numbers, demanded ID proofs and said he would report to the police if we don't take the gym membership for a WHOLE YEAR. He basically wanted us to pay 18k, and did not let us go from there for 1 hour.\n\nWe said we don't have IDs or money, and we can get it tomorrow. Since then, we haven't been to that area and he's been calling us from random numbers. We have blocked him and today A got a call from the district constable, who asked him to report to the station. A asked him for what, he refused to tell and just said come here soon.\n\nWhat are our options now?\n\nEdit - We told everything to our parents, they contacted the police themselves and the case has been settled and we didn't pay shit to the gym owner.

Maternity Hospital and got myself registered there (OPD card generated) but gave them my friend's name instead of mine and some random father's name for the sake of my privacy. Then went to OPD clinic to see a doctor. The Doctor wrote some blood tests and ultrasound (USG) in my prescription card. It was moderately crowded. They even wrote 'unmarried' in my OPD card.\n\nBlood tests were done without much fuss - no identity card was demanded.\n\nBut for the ultrasound (USG), they straightaway asked me for AADHAR card copy to proceed with USG. I was not prepared for this. I told I don't have Aadhar right now but maybe I can provide some other ID like Voter ID or DL etc. instead. But they refused and asked me to bring Aadhar only.\n\nI kinda panicked and left and I went to a couple of private ultrasound diagnostic centres nearby but they were also asking for my AADHAR card along with USG prescription. Now my prescription has some random name but my AADHAR will have my real name and identity so I came back home again to think through this.\n\n**Regarding Identity**\n\n* Is AADHAR card mandatory for abortion or ultrasound? What's the law regarding this in MP or India?\n* Apart from law, what's the standard practice for ultrasound like what happens on ground in reality esp. regarding Aadhar and Identity proof?\n* Is it possible to find any ultrasound (USG) diagnostician who can do it without seeking my identity? Should I try searching for such a place or this will be a waste of time?\n* Do they verify Aadhar number and details in the Aadhar database or contact the family of the unmarried? Or is it just paperwork and formality? Can I getaway with giving some fake or modified/edited Aadhar card copy?\n\n**Other queries**\n\n* Do they still give MTP pills at stores without prescription?\n\nI don't want to link this to my Aadhar or any medical records and history. I hope you understand. Please help and guide.",

An example of their behavior can be seen in an incident wherein a pregnant woman was crushed to death with a tractor when a recovery agent from Mahindra forcefully tried to seize the vehicle. More on this can be found here: [https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pregnant-woman-run-over-by-loan-recovery-agents-jharkhand-police-101663349403969.html](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pregnant-woman-run-over-by-loan-recovery-agents-jharkhand-police-101663349403969.html) \n\n**Who exactly are these recovery agents?**\n\nRecovery agents are third-party individuals contracted by a bank or lending company to recover a loan on the verge of being converted to a non-performing asset (in simple terms, a bad debt).\n\n**If you are a debtor, what are your rights?**\n\n1. Recovery agents are required to show their bank-issued ID cards if asked.\n2. Recovery agents cannot breach your privacy by discussing your pending debt and other personal details with your acquaintances, relatives, neighbors, and work colleagues.\n3. Recovery agents must use decent and civil language when interacting with the debtor.\n4. Recovery agents cannot use aggression and forceful imposition against a debtor.\n\n**What does the law say?**\n\n1. In *ICICI Bank v. Shanti Devi Sharma*, the Supreme Court condemned banks' forceful and aggressive practices via recovery agents, which caused uncalled-for hue and embarrassment to the debtor.\n2. Shortly after that, RBI issued a notification with reference number RBI/2007-2008/296, laying down guidelines for sensitization and compulsory civil behavioral training before recruitment.\n3. In 2020, RBI laid down Fair Practices Code for Asset Reconstruction Companies with reference number RBI/2020-21/13, reiterating civil practices to be followed during the recovery process.\n\n Be aware and steer clear of such malpractices.",

        "text": "Note: This post is informational and not a request for legal advice.\n\nAhmedabad: A local court here ordered the recovery of 5 lakh from an employee by her employer towards damages for quitting the job without notice and for her unexplained absenteeism. The court allowed the company to recover the amount in an order passed in an ex parte hearing as the employee did not participate in the court proceedings. \n\nThis case involved Mariya Rajput, who was appointed as trainee associate (finance) by Jensen Kobain Solutions Pvt Ltd in Feb 2021, with a probation period of six months. After completion of probation, her appointment was confirmed on certain service con-ditions. The terms of her employment contract required her to submit a written resignation notice 30 days prior to her intended last day of work.\n\nAccording to the suit filed by the company, after her appointment Rajput's attendance was irregular, and she would be absent from work without obtaining prior ap-proval. When the firm issued an absconding notice to her in Nov 2022, she sent her resignation through an email. The firm told her that her resignation was not in accordance with the employment agreement; the firm advised her to withdraw it and requested her to work at least until her notice period was over. However, the employee continued to remain absent.\n\nThe firm then issued a notice to her through an advocate asking her to pay 5 lakh for quitting the job in violation of employment terms, but the notice was not answered. The company filed a suit for breach of contract, citing employment agreement violations, which led to a claimed monetary loss and harm to the company's reputation. Since the employee did not respond to the court's notice, it decided to proceed ex parte. \n\nAfter recording evidence, the court said: \"Under these circum-stances, as discussed above, I have no hesitation to conclude that the plaintiff company is entitled to recover an amount of 5 Lakh from the defendant as legal and valid dues.",

The rest is a copy paste of what happened from their pov:*\n\nWe were hanging out in a park when we saw a man beating his wife in the park. It caught everyone's attention, which led to many confronting the man.\n\nThe woman was crying profusely, her arrogant husband responded with **'I can do whatever I want with her because she is my wife & this is our matter'** on being confronted. When some guys told him that they were going to call the police, he said something like **'call them, I don't care, I can beat her.'** The victim/wife told us to not call the police while crying, basically said that she was his wife, so that gave him the right to beat her. She was obviously very scared. \n\nThis man was not scared to bash her head publicly and even had the nerve to say that he had all the right to do that, you can only imagine how bad he is in private. \n\nA picture of the number plate of the couple's two-wheeler was also taken. That husband did get angry when he realised this & the fact that he was being recorded. The couple went away by the time police came. One of the two police officers looked like your typical useless Indian police officer shown in movies. Disrespectful, overweight, unconcerned with his duty and started scaring us with \"legal repurcussions\" for getting involved in the matter. \n\nHe told us that nothing could happen since the wife was allowing her abuse and that only when she complained would something happen. He also told the students that if they still decided to complain, then the families of all us would be involved, the landlords of their PGs would be involved & that the whole process of getting involved would be exhaustive. \n\nCan anything be done now, or should this be let go? Should the video and number plate of the vehicle be uploaded on internet? May be that way something could happen. Would uploading the video cause any trouble to the person who recorded it? **This happened in Chandigarh, btw.**\n\n**EDIT: Thanks everybody for your comments. It seems that only the video being posted online option is the best that can be done, so that's what I have done. Neither I nor the person on whose behalf I've made this post is on Twitter, so I'm gonna post the video on reddit, may be someone from reddit can post it on twitter.

On a therapy session she wouldn't open her mouth when the psychiatrist ask her any questions and after a while she start crying.\nSame thing happened for 10 therapy session so the psychiatrist said to my dad it's of no use she ain't opening her mouth and crying so she told to stop bringing her.\n\n\nAfter discharge from hospital my dad try taking her to 2-3 psychiatrist she does the same thing there and my dad also stopped .\n\n\n\nIn 2012 she got angry and thrown a 10-20kg toolbox containing hammer and all from upper room to down luckily my sister got away .\nI was shaken in fear that time and my grandma handled and beaten her & my tution was there so I went there and for 3hours for first time in my life I had thoughts of how dangerous she is and felt anxiety.\nWhen I come home I was shocked she was eating sandwich making by my dad and watching tv & has no f regret on her face not even a little bit. My dad didn't react on this at all.\n\n\n\nIn 2015(8 years after she left school and was completely been at home with no communication outside family members) \nShe started a new habit or we can say addiction of watching tv all day and not shifting her eyes a bit & she got damn addicted to watch old black & white tamil movies and DD(doordarshan) Tamil all day.\nDon't know how she started it but she acted like a addicted druggie.\nIf the current is off or the cable is gone she would allowed to turn off the tv until it's back and watch the channel until they show a commercial. And if we stopped her she would act like a psychopath and throw things and then we have to make her calm down and all.\n\n\nAlso she doesn't wash her clothes , her plates don't make her hair literally don't do anything other than watch tv and torturing us.\n\n\nMy dad died on 2016 and even when he was in icu she didn't cared and watched TV \nYear by Year her TV addiction got worse and she would now watch tv holding it so other wouldn't distrub her.\n\n\nWe even gave her a mobile in 2021 so she would watch her missed tv shows(we've to bought her bcoz she was literally not even let us sleep  by torturing us)\n\n\nIn 2022 she used to sleep at 3am and woke up at 8 am to watch dd national so she woke up and went to toilet the carpet was slippery so she slipped and got her legs broken and have to insert a rod on her on her leg during Oct time and on December end my other sister wedding was at kerala so I went there my mom can't able to make it bcoz she has to take care of her .\nSo during that time doctor adviced her to don't walk for sometime and we live in a slim with no toilet so my mother has to take her shit to gutter in a paper But one day she got angry and to just torture my mother she beaten her and she went outside and walked for an hour on road my mother was alone that time so she couldn't able to do anything except what that monster wants.\n\n\nNow today she put the mobile on water at night and when i asked she said I put it on water in 11:00 pm and taken it back on 2:00 am\nAnd had no regret absolutely no regret on her face .\n\n\nThe reason she thrown her phone into water is bcoz\nSince last year she also started a new addiction of going outside home at night or at time when no one is outside and collecting garbage or anything which she sees outside and putting it inside her bed .she doing it don't know why asked her 1000x she wouldn't answer , my mother has to remove it and the next day when I go to office she beats her tortures her physically and mentally & my mother still throws her shit.\n\n\nMy mother frequently begging me she can't take it anymore & to send her to some other place or send my mom to old age home.\n\n\nI don't know what to do regarding this \nPlease Please help ",

The medical advice I received has been clear: I need to reduce stress, prioritize my health, and take time off work. Given this, I made the decision to resign and focus on my recovery.\n\nHere’s the issue: My company is refusing to accept my resignation. They are telling me that I’m still bound by a 5-year bond, and since I’ve only completed 2.5 years, I’m expected to fulfill the remaining 2.5 years of the bond agreement. I understand that there are legal aspects to consider, but my health has to come first.\n\nI signed a 5-year bond agreement when I joined, but given the circumstances of my health, I feel it’s unreasonable to expect me to continue working under this contract.\nI’ve tried to explain my situation, but they are adamant about me fulfilling the bond or facing penalties because bond don’t have breaking condition , so if I want also I can’t break it.",

        "text": "\nSince there has been significant increase in the cases of revenge porn and nudes being shared online just to satisfy the personal vendettas , I am going to share you the last minute resources that can come handy when you are in distress asking for help .\n\n\n\n\nAnyways , it’s much better you avoid sending your explicit and revealing images . But I am providing as much as resources .\n\n\n#1. What to do when someone threats you to viral or put your nudes on social media ? \n\nFirst thing is try to calm down yourselves and your situation . Most of the time , these people are just bluffing around so that you can be submissive down to their threat . \n\nTry to talk to that person . Never ever lose the conversation with the same person. Every person is emotional at the end and you can buy some more time through this .\n\nSave the documents and screenshots where he is threatening you . Make sure to save them to your device . This can be crucial evidence if you decide to report the matter to the authorities. Also if he does the same on mobile call , do record the call. \n\nNext thing to do is to protect your privacy . Change your password of social media sites and secure yourself but don’t deactivate the account as you will need the account to report to authorities . \n\n#2. Where to report this and stop the happenings? \n\nThis is very serious concern but more often most of the sites takes time to respond to it and till that moment your pictures might have shared online and people may save it which is irreversible. A material once come online is almost hard to erase .\n\nSo where do you report . There are government organisation that are here to save your from this cluster and also  some NGOs. \nMeta which was previously Facebook has also a site that directly tackles revenge porn. I am going to mention each one step by step. But the early disposal can be done by reaching out to :\n\n* Cybercrime helpline: 155260 (Toll-free)\n* Childline India Foundation: 1098 (Toll-free)\n* Samaritans Helpline: 1098 (Toll-free) (Available 24/7)\n* Sneha Foundation: 044-2660 0000 (Chennai)\n* AASRA: 98208 57297 (Mumbai)\n* Sumaitri: 011-2337 9237 (Delhi)\n\n#You can also report the threat to the Indian cybercrime authorities through the Cybercrime Reporting Portal (https://cybercrime.gov.in/).\n\nAlso https://takeitdown.ncmec.org/\n\n#You can also contact https://www.instagram.com/nakshatra.bagwe/reel/CvZsz2bt5Wc/ on insta . He does the content removal work.\n\nAlso you can ping me on my Reddit or my telegram : t.me/its_ig (Apostrophe)\nDon’t panic in these situations and calm your mind . \n\n\nFor the stop NCII(non-consensual intimate image) which is a platform made by meta to counter revenge porn . It comes helpful under two scenarios that we will discuss below . It can help you counter revenge porn or sharing of your explicit pictures on platforms like Instagram, Snapchat , Facebook , twitter,Reddit, bumble,tinder and every possible app, you name it.\n\n#Link to the site : https://stopncii.org/\nIt also has a mobile app.\n* StopNCII app: Helps victims report and remove NCII content online.\n\nSo we were talking about two of the scenarios .lets breakdown each one \n\n#Scenario 1: Your nude photos are being threatened to be uploaded online:\n\n* This would fall under the umbrella of Non-Consensual Intimate Image (NCII) abuse. Sharing or threatening to share intimate images without consent is a form of cyberbullying and harassment, as I mentioned earlier. The advice I provided about documenting the threat, reporting it to the authorities, and seeking support also applies in this case.\n\n\n#Scenario 2: Your friend consensually shared their nude photos with someone, and now that person is threatening to upload them:\n\n* While this situation wouldn't technically be considered NCII in its strictest sense, it still involves a potential breach of trust and can have serious consequences for your friend. The advice about seeking support, changing passwords, and reporting the threat to social media platforms or the authorities still applies. \n\nSome NGOs that can be helpful in these situations are : \n\n* Cyber Peace Foundation: https://www.cyberpeace.org\n* Cybercrime Reporting Portal: https://cybercrime.gov.in/\n* National Crime Records Bureau: https://ncrb.gov.in/\n* Cyber Saathi: https://www.cybersaathi.org/\n* Cybercrime Awareness and Prevention Society (CAPS): https://cyberprevention.org/\n* Red Dot Foundation: https://reddotfoundation.org/\nInternet sansar: https://digiinfomedia.online/\n\n\n\nSome apps other than stop ncii \n\n* CyberSaathi app: Provides safety tips and resources for online safety.\n* SHE Power app: Connects women to emergency services and helplines\n\nYou can read more about cyber protection at this site : Internet Sansar: https://digiinfomedia.online/cyber-awareness-ngo-in-india/\n\nWhile these resources offer support and guidance, it's important to remember that they may not be available 24/7. In case of immediate danger, always call the police at 100.\n\n\nIf I have missed something , please feel free to add to the post.",

They aren’t declaring the time of death but looks like it’s a few hours after the call. \n\nSome facts:\n1) He’s a doctor and he overdose. \n2) He was suffering from mental health issues. This is corroborated by his Principal and Dean, and I know the psychologist whom he was seeing. \n3) No note. \n4) Some assets sold. Looks planned from sometime. \n5) We asked an IAS to speak to police station. Still took two days and delays by the police. Not rude but some delays and pushing us in cycles. \n6) Without the cause of death, the police asked us to come back in 10 days. Mom asked the cop what’s the reason, he said “why do you want to know. It will only hurt you”. \n7) We have his two cellphones.\n8) I’m worried the investigation will run over for 1) money 2) delay things and that will further cause stress to our family. \n9) He was under several medications for Shizo, Personality Disorder.\n10) Denied promotion because of the above mental health issues. \n\n\nWhat could happen?

When he reach on our front side me and my gf don’t look anything suspicious.My girlfriend ask him to delete videos but he said he didn’t take any of it.Im sure he took some video of us scuffling(atleast) when he opens the door.\nFast forward 10-15mins after he let us go after me and my gf begs him saying we won’t do again. Maybe he didn’t escalate the situation because he lacks evidence ?????\nNote- when he first confronted us,he told me he saw us kissing and my gf giving me a bj but I’m sure that as he is looking from behind our car its not fully visible with all the back side seat being at a heightened level then the front seat and with all the head rest and when he reached the front seat we looked as if we did nothing.Before leaving he tell us both me and gf to call him after reaching home to know that we are safe and to drive home safely.From my gut feeling he seems a genuinely good guy.During the confrontation,he take me to a temple nearby to promise on the god of the temple that I marry my gf(of 3 years) or else let the god take my life away.\nThen he called us at night,the 3 of us talk for 10-20 mins,he is explaining how such horrible things happen at that place(it was our very first time at that place,we thought that there are no people nearby, we don’t know such things happen).He said their community member scold him as to why he didn’t bring us to their community hall and give some pusihments to us.He told us he lied to them and even deleted our numbers in case they look into his phone.\n\nMy question- what can I do if he uploads the videos on the internet like Facebook ?(He told us that he didn’t take any video, I’m sure he did take some video even if it is not a clear visual one.)If the video is on Internet then our lives will be ruined,we won’t be able to live anymore,we will lose all respect.My gf said she won’t live anymore.My conscience says that even if he has the video,it will be all from behind our car in which we can’t be seenproperly.but our initial confrontations will be all seen in that video,of us begging him ewe are sorry.\nPlease give some advice.\n",

        "text": "**Wholeheartedly Apologies for my immaturity.....** to all the members for this sub who replied to help me, I really don't know the background of the property but well aware of the fights between my grandfather, father and taujis. I will consult more with my mother. I am not very much into what my family owns or whatever. My father gave me good education and simple lifestyle and seeing him tensed from few years my mood was off so asked here. He won't be telling anything directly about family tensions as he wants me do my own good and not get into family matters. Even knowing that we own this much my father wanted me to earn money through my job or whatsoever. That's why I regularly do freelancing & tutoring for my money. \n\nAbout property it mostly is non-agricultural land but near some state highway of UP and Bihar. In total it can be combined worth of 16-18Cr and rest 3-5Cr is a bungalow in good city. (Its not exact 21Cr but can range from 19-22Cr)\n\nThanks for overwhelming response, I am sorry that I can't reply anything useful regarding this. I thought **just for safety to know if there is some legal procedure if at last my father was really excluded.** But that would need more info. Apologies again.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ Earlier question was below.......\n\nMy grandfather is refusing to provide equal share to his three sons. The property to be inherited is worth \\~21 Cr (my mother said) (comprises of plain fertile lands, gutters or infertile land, and bungalows) to be (ideally) distributed among three but my grandfather says he will give it only to two elder brothers of my father. My father will be getting nothing.\n\nIf anyone wants the reason its simple that my father is short tempered and he often argues with my grandfather and also sometimes yells at him. When my grandfather says he won't get a penny of property he argues more. I feel sad seeing these state of affairs.\n\nIs there some legal route here so that my father can convince my grandfather, so that these family tensions can go away and equal distribution of wealth happens? My uncles (father's elder brothers) also internally don't want to share the property so they say they will do whatever my grandfather will decide (as it is anyway benefitting them).\n\nWe live a modest lifestyle and aren't poor but this property thing causes daily issues at home because my father's dream are big.",

My mother works as a Branch Manager in company with an average salary, we never managed to get a flat or any major assest and still live in rented house.\n\nRecently we got to know that there was a credit card which was issued on my mothers name and been used by my father in 2009 amount of Rs 98,57,857/- which was done in a city where my mother has never been in her life. Now, the bank indeed has transferred the case to a private receovery agency who are constantly harrasing me and my mother which is becoming unbearable for me. My mother has worked tirelessly to make sure that I get proper education and healthly life however seeing her in this kind of position is breaking my heart day by day from inside. I have reported and mailed several crime portals however the process and all seems to be too long. The recovery agency people are calling via multiple numbers using using vulgar language and threats. Please Help Us 🙏🙏\n\nP.S- I have googled my fathers name which ends up with several cases of domestic violence(later spouses), and financial frauds.  \n\n\nUPDATE 1: The Initial Credit Card amount was 1,27,000 which had increase to over 98 lakhs over these years. I emailed Standard Chartered Bank to which they replied   \n\n\n>We are writing to you to inform you that the Standard Chartered Bank has, sold, transferred and assigned all its right, title and interest in all the amounts due and payable by you, under credit card numbers ending with 7491 in favour of M/s.Shaha Finlease Pvt.

Ltd., at the below mentioned mailing address and contact numbers for repayment of the dues.\n\nI also got update from CyberCrime Department to which they have transferred to my nearest police station now question stands that whom shall I actually file case on Standard Chartered or ShahaLease Finance and the mental harrasment I am going through from recovery agents who seems of no help except using vulguar languages.",

        "text": "We have just moved into a new society as tenants. Apparently the society has a rule (one amongst many) about lift usage. \n\nThere are 2 lifts. One lift is reserved for residents and guests . The other lift is expected to be used by maids, delivery persons, garbage persons etc. This is a society rule and it is not mentioned in written in our rent agreement, just a notice is posted outside the lift area in the lobby.\n\nWhen we moved in we did not instruct our house helps and nanny to use any specific lift (why should we? It's discriminatory to ask them to use the 'designated' lift imo). However today some aged lady spotted our house help and nanny using the 'main' lift and asked them to stop doing so from next time. This incident was reported to us by our house help and nanny. \n\nAlthough we can choose to comply with the society requirements, it seems wrong at a basic level. Can we choose not to comply in case someone comes to us with a complaint? Another way we could navigate the issue is by stating that these ladies are our 'guests' when they come to our place, but again it's like finding a loop hole. \n\nI want to understand if there is any legal basis for the society to make such discriminatory rules, and in case of confrontation what is the best line of argument?\n\nEdit: this is in Pune. The society has about 150 flat units. Also the 'other lift' is not a service lift, it is a regular lift, just that it is older in condition and has manual doors. It is technically not a service lift because dimensions wise it is exactly the same as the regular one.\n\nEdit 2: many of the comments have mentioned some reasons why such rules are implemented e.g. pet's, kids having to use the lift with strangers, movers and packers occupying the lift etc. While I agree that pets and packers may be justified, however I don't agree with the issue of kids travelling with outside strangers. This logic assumes that a society person is safe. Also the lifts have cctv which may act as a deterrent control.",

I really need my phone as I have tuition classes right after school and I would need to book a cab to come back home. Upon request, I was given permission from the Dean to carry my phone to school. About a week later there was a new policy in school stating that phones are not allowed to school no matter what the reason is. As I did not go to school for about 2 weeks because of an exam, I did not know about this policy. As usual, when I took my phone to school the next week, it was taken from me despite informing the teacher that I had permission from the dean. Her response was that all permissions are now void after the policy and now that I got my phone to school she will have to take it from me. Its been two weeks so far and despite my parents contacting the school multiple times, there was no proper response about getting the phone back until yesterday. Now they want me to pay a fine of ₹5000 to get the phone back unless I want the school to keep it. The phone was bought by my parents and therefore I feel that the phone is not property of the school and they have to give it back for free no matter how long they keep it. Is this even legal where you are made to pay to get your own property back? ₹5000 is a ridiculous fine as my phone itself costs about ₹9000. This is in Telangana, Hyderabad. This is a private school.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the replies so far!\n\nEDIT: Legally dealing with the school might cause in me not getting any recommendation letters from school for applying to a college abroad.",

        "title": "Orphan teenage girl Gave her life to rich squids, now being kicked out in 20s.",
        "text": "I am writing this on the behalf of a girl from bihar who came to delhi when she was 11 with other adult kids of her village to see festival of 26th January in Delhi, and she never went back.\n\nThis girl, we can call her siya, spent few days with her adult friends in delhi, these adult friends came to delhi through agency of housekeeping. At one occasion A lady from middle class society saw her and took her with herself on the pretext of giving her work and will pay her as well. all siya needed to do was take care of her baby.\n\nfrom this lady's house another lady took her and promised her that she is like a daughter to her from now on and she is siya's mother. and Siya was happy to know this. But siya was not given any formal education and nor was given a penny. this lady is married and the couple had their own problems like no support from their family as they married against their parent's wish. And also got no generational wealth. Also they could not have a child of their own, even when they tried.\n\nYears went by and when siya turned 17-18, her adopted mom became sick, She had health issues since always but It took shape around this time, and siya went above and beyond to take care of her mom, used to go to hospitals, go for doctors appointments, took care of her medication. Overall she was a good companion in this for her adopted mother.\n\nBut unfortunately her mother could not survive and left poor siya with her father, who also went in depression. Now they moved to different town and siya's father's family came to take care of him, siya's adopted grandfather even came to live with them, and siya's father sister also started visiting them.\n\nIt has been year and more now, and family is stable, Siya took care of her father as well through this difficult time. now the family is pressuring the father to get married again, and he is also thinking about it.\n\nMore about siya: nobody likes her, except the father, Being from a village of bihar she has a accent which makes her distinct and because of that the rest of the family considers her a \"maid\". the old grandfather never misses a chance to call her that. the father's sister wants to kick her out of the house as soon as possible. and her mother's sister is also ver mean to her.\n\nTwo days ago her father asked siya to go back to her home as he no longer can support her, this made siya teary and broken. she feels like she has given her prime years to the family and now she is just being kicked out because they want to make room for new bride.\n\nMy mother offered to teach her language and numeracy 6 months ago. And my mother is constant support and a confidant to her. She wants her to get a job and go for education ahead. Siya knows reading now and basic mathematics calculation. My mother takes her to walks to markets and parks, as siya had never left home much and doesn't know how to deal with the real world.\n\nSiya didn't even have a adhar card until her late teens, It happened when her late mother made the process happen on her death bed, even then her age on the adhar card is wrong, it says born in 1995 though she turned 21 recently. This not it, her Pan card is a mess too. On that her father's name is just kumar. which doesn't match with the father's name on adhar card. So in this case she cant have a bank account either. Now my mother went to the aadhar card centre with siya to get it corrected but the authorities over there said we need class 10th certificate, but she doesn't have one. because these leaches didn't let her study.\n\nSiya cannot even go back to her home, because it has been so many years, and moreover her family will not accept her now as she has been out of radar for so many years.\n\nToday Siya's father also asked to consider moving back. Siya doesn't know where to go from here.\n\nMe and my mom are trying our best to help her. We can get he into open school. and can go to offices to get her documents fixed. But we don't have much information how to proceed. We also want the family to pay siya her salary of 11 years. We also suspect that they wrote her age wrong to escape from Child Protective services. Now soon this family is going to shift from here. And we are concerned what will they do with siya at new place. because here siya has made friends with me and my mom and another women in the society.  I am asking for help on the behalf of siya from this community. Please help.",

Everyone was walking as if they are taking the stroll in the park, people weren't even afraid of it. \n\n I was discussing this thing with my friend. I told, if I would have been there,  I would have done something, even at the cost of my life. She told, this would result in my own downfall, police cases, court, job will be gone etc. And I think her point was valid too. \n\nSo just to conclude, can a stranger intervene in such scenarios? While saving the girl, if I accidentally kill the stabber, will I go through trial? What is the best case scenario other than calling police and waiting for them within 60 sec window.",

        "text": "\n\n I am [28 F] and my husband [29 M] are married for 2 years. Ours is arranged marriage and he even was only doing sex at night and not much lovely or romantic during honeymoon. \n\nFrom the beginning I had a feel that he is not connected and has sex just for the baby . Only after being pregnant I caught him using these apps.\n\nHe was caught when I was pregnant for just 3 months after waiting for 1.5 years. He does all the chores and stuff but always says that he needs to hibernate and **never allowed me to touch him**. \n\nEven in our sexual relationship, I should be ideal and not talk anything. He behaves like a boss as if marriage is a company. Though he has sex with me but **no emotional lovely connection** at all. \n\nNow baby is delivered and 5 months. He is in foreign country which supports LGBQT and I am in India.\n\n2023 March : As I saw him using this app in secret in bathroom for hours telling that he is relaxing . I couldn’t bear it with 3 months baby in the womb, I flew to India without informing him with the help of my uncle ( as my parents might not be aware of LGBQt) .\n\nHe also told that he will file a case for flying without informing. Always talks human rights etc\n\nWhy I flew is , he was very aggressive and not caring , whenever I ask him “why did u marry me” he gets angry and started to break things , not even considering that I am pregnant.\n\nSo I was afraid, after coming to India. Their parents are not ready to accept “the fact am saying”\n\nJust for the sake of society and patch up, everyone pursued me to talk and ask sorry for flying uninformed during pregnancy.\n\nAfter delivery , he came to see the baby and stayed for 8 days. He Loved the baby only when the baby was quite.\n\nHe said that he will not change or he will not show password and he started to get angry blame me and behave rudely for silly things.\n\nNow he says he will not allow to touch him but if he wants whenever he wants he will just f… have sex with me , I should not talk funny or romantic with him , he will not be emotionally connected but for the sake of baby if I want I can stay in marriage .\n\nand he blocked me now for sending him a normal YouTube video (Karu karu karupaye song with decent couples in sofa funny watching tV), my father in law (m59) called and scolding me , why are you send  that kind of video when your husband is  in long distance.\n\nThen he said, I can’t reply/comment to all your video and messages but he says that he is an influencer (not even 2k followers) have never ever posted any of our pics .\n\nhe also ignores me in social media as well as in life, then whenever i ask him “ why did u marry me?”  He gets anger or shuts the door on my face .\n\nBut just for the sake of society he acts as a very responsible good husband. I am suffering inside emotionally.\n\nI wonder my husband did not ,have never spoke romantically or lovely with me but talks with random men asking out for cuddle date in Gay dating app. \n\nI also saw his laptop where he chat with boys( 27M) like lovers but not talk to me (f28) even in the early stage of marriage.\n\nBut says he chats just for fun like Snapchat for streaks only.it is just AI/bot, I talk with girls also etc\n\nHe also sent a text to some male as “ I am married and discreet too” ( I was not pregnant) he had many chats in archived and with disappearing texts.\n\nHe acts very smart and always Gaslighting,manipulative, narcissistic personality etc but masking under the category as very kind,caring, earns lot of money and saves money also spends lot for me, says that he is feministic. Please advice \n\nHe blocked me since November 2023 and dint care about the child but told that child will grow and know the truth.\n\nThey’re parents are blaming me that am sexually deprived and having hormonal issues in the society\n\nMy parents are worried about the baby and also my future.\n\nDono what to say or how to move further. He is not ready to accept but says that both we both are not compatible (long story short)\n\nAfter he blocking me, I mailed him to get a bank detail ( from which he is benefitted) , guess what… he replied to that.\nBut did not wish for new year or any occasion!\nAnd his family members also never came to visit the baby after this silence ( sending video) \n\nAll the proof that he is sexually chatting with men were erased by him. As he gifted me iPhone for engagement, after being caught he erased by setting “lost my device “ option.\n\nHow to move further?\nI have a girl baby\n\ntl;dr :   I am (f28) and my husband (m29) married for 2 years, I was suspicious about his chat with male friends but he ignored and after a year when I was pregnant he was using Grindr and says that he is not a gay but he is not emotionally connected to me . Has sex just for the sake of society. \n\nI dono what to do? \nAs I don’t have any proof\nPlease advice!",

        "text": "I'm getting sued by a foreign airline. I was living in europe last year and had an argument with staff while travelling back to india on a flight. Due to the argument, the flight got cancelled and I was detained for a day. Now 8 months later the said airline sent me an email demanding compensation of around 100000$ and blaming the flight cancellation on me tbh I was a muslim travelling in the said airline and felt their behaviour to be very racist. I'm worried now that they will sue me if I fail to pay it but I have no plans on going back to the said country. I am wondering now , can they sue me in Indian court ?\n\nEdit: Some people are accusing me of playing victim card here or what has all this to do with me being Muslim. I'd like to clarify that once the police was there and I was being taken away, I told them if I can get my carry on bag from the plane. They let me take it with me but in the letter I received , I'm being accused of making some statement regarding my carry on bag which alarmed the crew and they ordered the whole plane to be searched for bombs or something. How is asking to get my carry on bag = making a bomb threat ? Before accusing me of playing some victim card, ask yourself . If it was a european white guy asking to remove his carry on bag, would they have ordered a bomb squad for him as well ? They have mentioned in the letter that calling this bomb squad resulted in the plane being evacuated and caused it to cancel the flight. How am I liable for them cancelling the flight . I didn't make any threats or arguments and left the plane when the cops took me. ",

        "text": "It all started in January of 2022 in our college- while we were in 3rd year of UG- when a friend of us put forth an offer saying that his mother is starting a wholesale saree business where investors will get 15-20% of the invested amount as profit every 15 days. Initially everybody were hesitant and once some of his friends started making money, many started investing. There's no paperwork of any sort, everybody believed him since he was friend. 3 months into this he started leading a luxurious life(SUV, Gucci, etc.) which gathered other students' attention and even they started investing. As days passed the 15 days' returns became 30 days, then 45 days and so on. Even the 20% profit gradually started coming down; all this happened by the end of Nov 2022. That's when people who had invested a lot(more than 10L) started to panic and asked to withdraw the capital. The guy initially said that there's some issue with the bank which will be resolved by 1 month, during Jan 2023 and assured all that money is safe, this was confirmed by his mother too. By March '23 they confessed that they've been scammed by their boss. They've stopped paying since then and reply very rudely when asked about money. They're asking everybody to wait indefinitely; yet their luxurious lifestyle continues. They also threaten us that they'll kill themselves if we ask them to pay. \n\nI'm posting this behalf of my friends, who are mostly middle class. The money that he owes all of us is around 1 crore (this is just by the students of our college apparently they owe 7-8 crores to others)\nEverybody has gained at least 60% of the invested capital till now.\n\nAs proof they only have call recordings.

Within a week, he moved abroad without consummating the marriage, leaving her to endure unimaginable abuse from his family:\n\n* **Mental and Physical Abuse:** His parents and sister forced her into servitude, treated her like a maid, and physically assaulted her.\n* **Financial Exploitation:** Her husband demanded money to return home, exploiting her earnings while she had nothing left for herself.\n* **Isolation and Danger:** When she confronted him, he physically assaulted her and even tried to kill her multiple times.\n\nFinally, he confessed that he was homosexual and bipolar, admitting he had married her under false pretenses. Despite her courage in filing an FIR, the legal system has been anything but supportive. Her case is still going on from 2019-2024.\n\n1.[https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceIndia/comments/1dqml0k/updateabusive\\_gay\\_husband\\_reveals\\_homosexuality/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceIndia/comments/1dqml0k/updateabusive_gay_husband_reveals_homosexuality/)  \n2.[https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceIndia/comments/1dqml0k/updateabusive\\_gay\\_husband\\_reveals\\_homosexuality/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceIndia/comments/1dqml0k/updateabusive_gay_husband_reveals_homosexuality/)  \n  \nAs a friend, I feel helpless watching her fight this uphill battle. Till today the same quashing case is running, with the shameless husband's morally corrupt 72 year old lawyer abuses the legal process and takes dates over dates. Her resilience is inspiring, but no one should have to endure this level of suffering for so long.\n\nThe tragic death of Atul Subhash is a wake-up call. How many more victims will be failed by the system before something changes? It’s time to demand accountability, reforms, and a justice system that doesn’t punish victims further.\n\nEven with overwhelming evidence—abusive messages, medical records, and eyewitness accounts—the system has failed her:\n\n1. **Endless Adjournments:** A judge openly told her during mediation that her cases could drag on for 20 years, making a mockery of her suffering and abusing her human rights to get justice on time and live with dignity.\n2. **Corruption and Injustice:** Her husband has absconded abroad, bribing his way out of accountability, while she runs from court to court for basic action.\n3. **Defamation with No Consequences:** Her father-in-law uses social media to publicly humiliate her, yet no action has been taken.\n\nBoth the cases reveal the systemic failures:\n\n* **Delays Over Justice:** Endless adjournments leave victims with no closure.\n* **Exploitation of Legal Loopholes:** Accused individuals misuse the law to escape responsibility.\n* **The Emotional Toll:** Victims like my friend and Atul endure years of trauma, with no light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nMy friend is now in her late 30s, battling PTSD, severe migraines, and financial ruin. She lives with the constant threat of defamation and harassment while her abuser enjoys freedom abroad.\n\nThis isn’t just her story. It’s the story of countless others who are ignored, delayed, or abandoned by the very system meant to deliver justice.\n\nPlease share her story. Let’s stand together to ensure that justice is not just a privilege for the rich and  powerful but a right for everyone and help highlight a grim truth: victims, whether men or women, are often abandoned by the system meant to protect them.",

I was naive only 19. She called to stay at her for a night and I agreed even knowing the intentions. Things happened that Night and I still got the recordings. I was here in India for two months and we did it pretty much all the time. When I moved to Canada. I felt very guilty of the acts I have done. \nFast forward to 2020. I came to visit India and got stuck here because of Covid. I stopped talking to her in 2020 and even she was okay with it as I explained what I felt. \nFrom 2020, I am living in India as I loved the country so much this time because I got time to explore everything. \nComing to my Bua, she is unmarried and have had many boyfriends. She left India in 2021 because apparently she found her love of the life, the guy was French and she moved to Denmark with her. I wished her well, she requested for one last time to do it( I am explaining this because I have got call recordings of her telling me this). I agreed. I felt relieved knowing she is now gone and this chapter is closed. \nLast month in April she came back to India because that guy left her. She didn’t marry him btw. During this period when she was not in India, I went back to Canada for a month to help my dad with some business related issues. I started dating this girl who is madly in love with me and she left everything to come with me to India. She has no connections in India apart from me. She’s a white girl. \nThis Bua is now single and want to do stuff with me again which I politely disagreed to. Two days back, she called me saying she wants to marry me and settle with me in Canada. If I disagree she will file rape case against me, even though I have proofs of what happened. She even told me that she will take the matter to my father and whole family. Yesterday at night, she sent our recordings to my girlfriend(who lives with me in India) and destroyed our relationship. She now wanna go back to Canada and doesn’t want me. \nWhat are the remedies I have for this situation. Please help me.\nI don’t want to leave this country. \nI even asked her to settle the matter with money which she disagreed.

        "text": "\n\nToday while returning home with my family at around 11 pm, we were asked to stop for drunk driving. The police person was not wearing a mask. And asked me to blow into the device without a straw. When I resisted he called his senior. At that point I started recording them.\n\nThe senior came & asked me to co-operate.  I pointed out the police personel who was not wearing a mask & the person suddenly took a mask & put it on. Then almost 8-10 police personel surrounded my car. And started shouting. My kid started crying. Then they offered me a straw which I took & blew into their device. They made me blow 3 times to make sure that I was not drunk. \n\nSeeing my kid cry I was angry on their behavior. I told them that this is police harrassment & that the video will go on social media. At that point the police person - named Srikanth M. ( I do not remember the complete name ). snatched my phone & ran away. The other police men stopped me from coming out of the car while Srikhath deleted the videos & photos of all the culprits. \n\nBy that time I managed to get out of the car. Srikanth then pushed me while he kept on deleting the videos & pics. My wife also came down. Another senior officer started abusing me. My wife was able to take the phone from Mr Srikanth & then they allowed me to drive away. The whole time they had their cameras on me. Now they have all the videos & my license plate while I don't even have a clear pic of the culprits. \n\nKindly help on what action can I take. Will I be harrassed further? [While my phone was being snatched.](https://i.imgur.com/JwJAdzE.jpg)\n\nEdit: Thanks to the community, I am able to recover videos & photos including one where my phone is snatched. Kindly suggest what can I do now ?\n\nEdit 2: I had a huge discussion with my family, parents, etc & their suggestion is to not pursue the matter further. I agree that such bullying should be reported, however for someone who works from 8 am to 7 pm, it is a huge time consuming activity. The video contains a lot of personal information - the name of officers & even my name, so sharing it can bring a lot of heat. The video can be used in case I am harrassed further. Thanks to this community for the huge support & suggestions.",

        "title": "Fault in our stars.... born unlucky ... bad marriage... single parent ",
        "text": "Hi , I m 34 f born in kerala settled in karnataka.  Had a normal childhood. I am an introvert. So never got a chance to be in a relationship... it was all one way crushes. I was born manglik and astrologers scared us into marrying only with Kundali match. He said if she does love marriage she would have a very bad life or husband would die. Why would I risk someone's life. So I never took the risk to avoid pain. \n\nPS - very long post. Please jump to end for the summary 🙂\n\nI got married when I was 28 . It was arranged marriage and coincidentally his sister was working in the same office... she introduced herself to me after me and the ex husband (33 M when we married)  met for the first time with family. \nI met him in Feb,  married in may. I din get much time to get to know him. Since his sister was in my office she was after me whitewashing him saying he s the best guy in the world blah blah and literally forced me to acceptvhim saying please don't reject my brother. Kundali was matching,  my relatives checked their family background,  his ancestral family had good name. My relatives also forced me saying I m already 28 , parents getting old... usual manipulation.  So I got married. \nMy dad spent a lot. His pf money was used on my jewelry eventhough I asked them not to.  I told the ex husband that I don't like wearing jewelry like kerala brides he said okay not marrying u for ur jewelry .  Then my mom got a call from his mom saying dont tell ur financial troubles to ur daughter she s telling my son that she doesn't like wearing gold as it's her dad's pf money... we also gave our daughter lot of gold blah blah... my mother asked me to not talk like that to him . I got married wearing lotbof jewelry like a malayali bride. On the night of my wedding the MIL was saying lot of thief's in the area , and she will keep the gold in her cupboard as it has lock. Then next day she kept it in bank locker taking all her Relatives with her to show off saying we will be in blr so lets keep it in locker. I thought fair enough since its safer....That was the biggest mistake of my life!\n\nAfter that their behavior with me changed. Sister in law used to bully me and got involved in our private life constantly. MiL treated me like a servant.  And husband's attitude changed completely,  started acting like he married me under pressure from parents,  he doesn't like fat women. Which angered me. I asked him y dint u say this in the beginning. Then the whole family used to fat shame me on regular basis because that the only thing they had against me. I had more education and good job. So they started pin pointing my weaknesses.  Once they understood that by fat shaming they couldn't get into my head , the husband started insulting me in bed saying I m fat and ugly and he gets turned off seeing me and having sex with me is like necrophilia... I had to google this word. This started affecting my confidence.  He used to compare me with his sister constantly like she does her hair color , takes care of fig everything for her husband but I Don't do all that and I don't have qualities of a women I look like Transgender blah blah .my self esteem was going down and down. Then I got pregnant.  No one was happy.  The SIL asked me to abort but I kept the baby. Thinking that would improve my marriage. But it was a disaster. During covid lock down I was 3 months pregnant he kicked me out of the house when I asked him not to smoke next to me. He was a chain smoker.  I was alone throughout my pregnancy. Nobody came after I delivered baby. They came after a month after persuasionfrom from my parents. After 6 months he called me back to his house because he had no job. He constantly asked money from me. After I went to his house his mother asked me to join job as he was jobless. I was sole breadwinner of that house. His mother din help me with the baby at all. She watched Serial all the time intentionally. She and the husband were constantly fighting over bills so I helped him in paying seeing her insulting him I made him do some course in data science spending my money. \n\nAfter 6 months I came to my home with my baby as nobody helped me with my baby in his house and I had to work and I had health issues also. While was at my home I asked him to send me his resume which he dint. Before also when he was left job I had asked him his resume he never shared. We had a fight about this and he blocked me for 3 months. In this 3 months I tried to contact him in many ways. He completely disappeared and I cried every night .then I took the decision to divorce after much thinking.  I had nothing in this marriage.  There was only mental and financial abuse!\n\nBefore filing the divorce when parents discussed the issues we asked them to return my jewelry which I had worn on my wedding day. They refused to give that and asked me to go to court! His dad said let ur daughter be with u and let us keep ur gold. He wanted to scare me that they ll take custody of my daughter if i open my mouth. Now it's been 3 years me and my father are roaming court for my own assets!!\n\nBut During this time I got to know lot of bitter truths\n1. The ex husband was engineering drop out. He married me saying he was from a particular engineering college. We got to know it was fake. He said he was a system engineer but he was tech support guy.\n\n2. They were highly debt ridden. Their father was drunkard and never worked his whole life. They lived by selling mother's gold and ancestral property shares and were out of money after they got their daughter married to show off by taking huge loans.  They married me only to use my jewelry for clearing the debts.\n\n3. They always portrayed me as mentally unwell whenever I reacted to their unfair biases , comments and body shamingand physical abuse like kicking and chocking.  the ex husband was emotionally unavailable to me throughout the marriage. Their plan was to discard me or force me into committing suicide so that they can completely use my jewelry! And they would show the world that I might have killed myself due to depression or mental illness \n\n4. My own cousin knew that they were frauds but she and her family kept it from my family so that I marry and suffer. They thought I would suffer the marriage and financially drain myself and my family to protect the marriage. \n\nThis was a well orchestrated hiest but plan derailed as I got pregnant. My baby saved my life\n\nThe only reason I tolerated this marriage was for my parents and I din wanted a divorce but after filing divorce I realised their truth and if I had not taken this decision I would have been on news of dowry deaths.  They would have killed me if I had found out about their truth when I was with them and made it look like a suicide.\n\nWill I get my gold back ?? Court procedures are delaying due to high number of cases and they bunk most of the time. I visit every hearing. They have ran away to blr and I heard they booked flat also. I have proofs of them taking gold loans even after we filed case. Please suggest . I m just asking for my gold which is my asset and I din ask for alimony also. I m a single parent and he never tried to even see the child.he and his family are great in disappearing after cheating . Will I get justice?",

I paid for that seat.\n\nNow this might sound stupid and small but it's about the confort that I paid for, I suffer from motion sickness and prefer a side head rest which is the window. \n\nIs there a legal way I can take this up because clearly the customer care just didn't help. Maybe I am too angry but if I am paying for it, I am getting it or something better, definitely not the worst.\n\n\nEdit: They gave me another window seat instead in the 9th row which was decent, so I guess no point now.

I was travelling in 3rd AC of a train and I was sitting on side lower berth. I was working on my laptop (Apple Macbook) and the seat in front of me fell down and completely broke the laptop's display, it was heavy enough that it bent the Macbook's aluminum display. My wrist also took the fall and it's paining since. It was a new laptop, I complained on their helpline, on twitter, even to the train staff and TT. They filed a complaint and closed it after few minutes by themselves, twice. No response on Twitter too except asking for number.\n\nI've video, audio and my mother as witness. Other train passengers witnessed it too. I checked the latch of the seat which fell before sitting there myself.

That increased the number of pages of the complaint. \n\nI had no idea court needs 3 copies of it and 3 to the opponent. That printing only costed me some ₹450 (it had color photographs as well).\n\n3. Once reached the commission to submit it physically. They asked me to tie all with a thread. AGAIN. I had no idea, took 30 min to do it. And once came back to office, they asked no, tie three separetly and other 3 separatly.\n\n4. Then they asked, where are the envelops? Only you need to buy and paste the postal stamps for the destination. (Now my files were already heavy)! It costed ₹145 per opponent party x3) for stamp duty. A4 envelop charges 6₹ each. (Indian post offices accepts only CASH!!!! No UPI)\n\n5. Once came back to commission office, they asked to open the threads and tie the envelops too with it.

        "text": "I’m sorry for the long paragraphs in advance. my ex(then 17, now 23)and I(then 14, now 20) were dating for 5 years. I was naive and young when I met him. I was 14 and he was 17. I was in another country and he was in India. We met online and what started as a friendship, turned into love when he confessed that he has feelings for me. I liked him too but I was unsure of our future because of the distance. He told me to move to India and made me tell my parents. He told me he would be with me if I move to India. He potrayed that he really cared for me and I fell for it. I was deprived of love from my parents since the beginning and I just felt like I found my person, my soulmate. I made him the centre of my world.\n\nI came to India, despite my parents opposing, I joined 10th and started to meet him often at my place as I wasn’t allowed to go out. He was in his 12th and we clearly had agreed to the fact that we will have engage in sex after we get married as I wanted to preserve my virginity for my marriage. To which even he obliged in the beginning but after few months, when we were \nmaking out he asked me if we can have sex, to which I say yes as he promised to marry me. \n\nafter one year I find out that he’s been cheating on me, he tells me it will never happen again and asks forgiveness. I come to know again that he has slept with someone else and I get furious and try to ask his friends for more information, he then slaps me and argues with me saying I spoilt his friendship between his friends because they snitched on him. He kept torturing me day and night for the same and blaming me for spoiling his life.\n\nI still stuck by him only and only because I wanted to marry him, I loved him genuinely and though he did me bad, I still see my whole world in him. He finally left me in November 2022. I was shattered as I never thought he would leave me, he left me for another girl. He cut off contact and blocked me everywhere \n\nI got into depression, started taking pills, smoking, alcohol abuse and everything to remain sane. He came back after a month and started sleeping with me, at this point I just wanted him in my life and I let him sleep with me. He got me pregnant and blamed me for enticing him. He didn’t even accompany me to a doctor. I had to go all by myself. I spent all my money on abortion and he didn’t even bother to be there for me. He hit me when I was pregnant.He made sure he kept it a secret that he’s still in touch with me, I told him I cannot sleep with him as I still have feelings for him.  When I would text him, he would come home to beat me up.\n\nHe has hit my head several times to which I have fainted, twisted my hands, choked my neck that I couldn’t breathe, he has beaten me up and threatened to kill me with a knife. I have videos of him pointing the sharp object at me. It still keeps going on. We both are law students studying in the same college, I’m in 3rd year and he’s in his final year. he’s already interning under a lawyer, no one knows this side of him. I have all the videos and pictures of the abuse and bleeding of wounds. \n\nAnd he’s happy while I’m popping my anti depressants. I am a fool that I believed he would marry me. I feel so guilty for moving to another country for him. I feel so guilty for losing my virginity to him. I feel so suicidal that I want to end it all. He told me that the lawyer under whom he’s practicing will defend him if I pursue legal action against him. He has also threatened me that he will murder me if I harm his reputation. Please help me out. I’m just 20, I’m not in a financial and emotional state to fight this battle, can I proceed legally once I secure a job? I have scars all over my body and I am feeling so helpless. \n\nEDIT - A lot of those who are practicing law have come forward to help me, I’m in talks with them, once I’m in a stable emotionally, we will look into the best feasible action which I can proceed legally. Thank you for your support, your kind words and gestures are truly appreciated. lots of love and prayers",

When I secured my first job, HDFC offered me a pre-approved loan of the same amount, which I selflessly provided to him. Initially, he managed the first EMI payment, but subsequent requests for the current month's installment were met with delays. After persistently asking, he became aggressive and outright refused to repay, even threatening me. I'm a recent IT industry entrant, juggling my education loan, which he promised to cover, along with living expenses. With a monthly salary of 25,000 rupees, half goes towards rent, education loan EMIs, leaving me with a mere 2,000 rupees to manage other essentials. I'm seeking advice on how to legally ensure he fulfills his commitment. Any guidance would be immensely appreciated.",

        "text": "Tired of getting bombarded by unwanted calls from telemarketers and vendors? The Ministry of Consumer Affairs has heard your cries and is taking action to put an end to this daily nuisance.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by a platform, 95% of people still receive unwanted calls and messages despite registering their numbers on the \"Do Not Call\" registry or the \"Do Not Disturb\" list. On average, 64% of mobile phone users receive three or more spam calls daily. The majority of these calls are related to \"selling financial services\" and \"selling real estate.\"\n\nTo combat this problem, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has introduced blockchain-based technology, but the challenge lies in controlling unregistered telemarketers. To make matters even better, the government is considering imposing a fine of ₹100 per unsolicited call, which will be credited to the consumer who received the call.\n\nUnder the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018, the penalties for unsolicited commercial communication have become stricter:\n\n* ₹1,000 per violation for 0-10 breaches\n* ₹5,000 each for 10-50 violations\n* ₹10,000 each for more than 50 violations\n\nFor those who do not know, here's how you can register with TRAI to filter such spam calls:\n\n1. Dialling 1909 \n2. By sending an SMS to 1909\n3. Register using TRAI DND 2.0 mobile app",

After separation, a looming threat of leaking such images is impending.\n\nSuppose your partner or ex-partner is threatening to leak or has leaked your private pictures or videos to an external entity, either a person or a website. In that case, you can do the following to escalate action:\n\n1. If your images or videos have been leaked on a website, write an e-mail to the website administrator mentioning that the upload of such media was non-consensual and ask for immediate removal.\n2. If the same have been leaked to a social media platform such as Discord or Reddit, contact the platform moderators via e-mail or other means and seek immediate removal.\n3. Go to [cybercime.gov.in](https://cybercrime.gov.in), and file a cybercrime complaint against the concerned individual, referencing all possible evidence you might possess linking them to the leak.\n4. Write a complaint to the National Commission for Women (**NCW**), detailing your plight and referencing all possible evidence.\n\nThe cybercrime complaint will escalate the matter from a criminal law perspective. In contrast, the NCW complaint will help in garnering support and creating pressure on the concerned individual(s) involved in the leak.",

I wasn't aware of this fact. From that very day i stopped giving him the money. He knew that I'm not gonna give him so he'd come up with some emergency situation or some other situations to trigger me emotionally. His family had financed two trucks for him so He'd say \"buddy it's very urgent i need money 30-40k the truck has arrived at the petrol pump and the driver is asking money, it's very urgent send it over\" so i said ask your parents and he said his parents want him to handle on his own so i agreed and again 30k i lended. He asked me money to pay truck's emi.\r  \n\r  \nHe said his family wasn't supporting him for truck's maintenance and emi and if he wont pay, the bank will never lend them money again if they wanna buy another truck\r  \n\r  \nOne day he sad he has caught himself into an accident and the victim i asking money for the damage and i again lended him 20k.In between I've asked him to pay me back several times and he would say\r  \n\r  \nBhai just give two days 3 days 4 days and im giving you back but he never did\r  \n\r  \nAnd now his family and i are getting aware of the fact that he'd been using my money for fucking gambling \\[sattebazi\\] behind my back. He fucking broke my trust. He took advantage of my emotional sensitivity. How foolish i am never did once tried to check authenticity of his reason to ask money.\r  \n\r  \nWhen i went to his family to talk about this shit he was being badly beaten by his folks and was sleeping while the four of his family member was blaming me that \"I HAD SPOILED HIM BY GIVING THIS MUCH MONEY. IF HE IS 100% WRONG THEN I AM 500% WRONG. HE WOULDN'T BE IN THIS SHIT IF YOU HADN'T GIVEN HIM THE MONEY. WHAT KIND OF A FRIEND YOU ARE YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD US INSTEAD YOU KEPT GIVING HIM. BECAUSE OF YOU WE\\[HIS FAMILY\\] AND YOUR FRIEND ARE SUFFERING AND I WANT YOUR FAMILY TO SUFFER TOO. WE WON'T LET YOU TO SLEEP PROPERLY WHEN WE ARE NOT SLEEPING AND EATING GOOD.

My mom called him batshit crazy, and we just walked away after he put the rock down. \n\nHe had also previously vocalized his distaste for us walking our dog over there. He claims that dogs shit near his house (not in front of the front door or anything like that, but on a patch of grass some 10 meters from his house, which probably doesn't belong to him) and near a holy tree (which is like 100 meters away from his house on a sidewalk and also probably doesn't belong to him). But, these encounters with him did not escalated to yelling and throwing around death threats.\n\nI'm wondering what I can do about this legally. I'm scared for my mom's and my dog's safety.

        "text": "I need some legal clarity on a situation with my Resident Welfare Association (RWA) in India.\n\nMy spouse and I are both working parents, and we have a 2-year-old toddler. For over a year, we have had a 16-year-old girl coming to our house to engage with our child. She plays with him, feeds him, changes his clothes, and puts him to sleep. She has developed a very strong bond with him—honestly, he is more comforted by her than even by his father sometimes. She is under the supervision of my parents since she is young. \n\nHowever, today, my RWA stopped her at the gate, stating that since she is under 18, she cannot enter the society. Their reasoning? They believe it's against child labor laws in India.\n\nFrom my understanding, the Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986 (Amended in 2016) states that:\n\nChildren below 14 cannot work. Adolescents between 14 and 18 can work, provided it’s not a hazardous occupation.\n\nBabysitting in a home does not fall under the category of hazardous work. So, legally speaking, there should be no issue with her babysitting my child.\n\nI tried explaining this to the RWA, but they are still refusing to let her in. They haven’t cited any specific legal provision—just an internal rule.\n\nDo they have any legal standing to enforce such a rule?\n\nWould a written consent letter from the girl's parents help in this situation.\n\nI really don’t want my toddler to lose the caregiver he loves, especially over what seems like a misinterpretation of the law. Looking for legal opinions on how to handle this!\n\n",

My neighbor who is a renter (the man does not own the flat), he claims that my painting and small civil work caused his tv to break and apparently made \"the walls vibrate\" which is completely untrue verified with the other neighbors. He started screaming on the top of this lungs, threatened my workers to leave. This man has questioned my character like imagine a grown old ass 50 year old man giving me endless gaalis, has information about me like personal anecdotes of my life(I have never met this man in my life). All of the other neighbours were so scared they could not come out to help, he was acting all pyscho. I was traumatised and scared for my life so I locked the house and ran to the police station, the police said we can't help you, it's your house and no one can stop you from working and shooed me away. They did not even let me file a ncr against him saying much nahi hoga madam agar much hua toh 100 dial karo. My workers are scared and have refused to come back to work since, this incident occurred 1 month ago. Oh guys by the way this man has a wife and a 7 year old boy. \nWait guys there is more 3 days ago, I went to my flat with my contractor to discuss what to do ahead and how do deal with crazy man, he apparently thought I was started work again so he came out of the his house and again started shouting and started aggressively shaking my grill and abusing me and my contractor but this time I recorded it, unfortunately only the part where he's telling my contractor to leave and abusing him, the man already scared left and immediately I went to the police station again and this time they did file a ncr against him (at first they were hesitant but after I showed them the video they were obligated to do that) and finally call him to the police station. Guess what this man did? \na. He opened questioned my character in front of the police, the police warned him that if you speak any further I'll put you in jail, this man did not care, verbatim said “mujhe farak nahi padta mai chutki mai nikal jaunga”\nb. he used his wife to write a false ner without any proof which states that I have abused her religion (for context he is Gujarati his wife is Marathi) which is completely untrue, I have never seen the woman before. \nThe man has openly threatened me that if you start work again I will get Marathi morchas against you and I am very well connected you can not do anything to me. I have tried talking to people in the bldg some people did come ahead and tell me that he is like that only. I tried contacting the flat owner but she is neither picking up my calls nor the police's calls, she is not bothered about this situation. The owner of the flat also is a woman but is blindly believing the renter and not coming forward to talk. Also this man has connections in the local police station, I know that for sure but I don’t know how to prove it. I just want to get the house painted remove little rabid and keep the house for rent. \nAt first he had ask for compensation without any proof for (6500/-) to fix his tv which I refused and said if you have proof of course I will compensate. At the police station the police were urging me to end the matter by giving him 3500/- on “humanitarian” grounds, my contractor convinced me to give him the money so we could work in peace, this man literally said “I do not want your pity money”. \nWhat do I do guys help? I am not going to sell this flat as it is my 1st purchase with my own money and it has a lot of sentiment. ",

We tried an out of court settlement but it did not work out.\n\nEdit 2: The decision is given as per NI act section 138 (dishonored cheque)",

We were really oblivious that the rent is supposed to be given in advance & paid the last month’s rent too (March) - At the time of emptying the place, I called him over & over to come and check your place - Check if everything is alright. He said that he’s in Maharashtra and will come on 2nd May only. I asked to send somebody else to check. We will not be liable if you start to complaint after 1 month that these things are wrong, damaged in the house. He said nobody is available. With no other option, I simply made a video while exiting the house. We left. \n\nAnd what I feared, happened. I called him on 3rd May & he started saying you’ve broken the cupboard, AC needs to be serviced, clocks are missing, the house is dirty, etc etc. I obviously denied all that because when we entered the house, we got it all cleaned up & AC serviced. Even then, I agreed to pay him 500-1000rs as cleaning charge & get over with it. Then he pulled another card saying electricity bill & Gas bill needs to be paid. I said we’ve already paid March’s bill. Only 10 of the bill remain, he said Gas ka 2 mahine mai ata h. When it comes, we’ll pay the bill & give the rest amount. \n\nAround 10-15 days later, I again called him & he again said AC servicing ka charge dena padega. Kitna ganda kar rakha h. “Kaala ho rakha h tumhari tarah” - he specifically said this. \n\nI lost my patience & said tera ghar koi mahal nhi h jo laakho rupee ka samaan kharab kardenge. 1 mahine se upar hogya har baar ka drama h aaj yeh kharab h vo kharab h - Apna rent to har mahine bhikariyo ki tarah maangta tha. He hung up, I called the broker & contacted him and said bill aane do mai kardunga wapas. Still, I haven’t received anything. He ignored my calls for a week & blocked my number. Called from another number - I raised my voice out of patience & be hung up while abusing. I 2-3 days called from another number - this time abused him. He blocked all the numbers. \n\nI have the video of the house, his racial remarks, & his call recording where he agreed to pay the security back, & the photo of the guard we handed over the keys to. \n\nI want to fuck this son of bitch legally. Won’t spare him at all. Shall I call 112 to just inform them about the case or there’s any other route? Please advice needed. \n\nThank You.\n\nEdit: I also have the official agreement with me.",

So he used to call me and talk sweetly in such a way to convince that he did nothing wrong. In an attempt to put our differences behind and start over, I agreed to many things which were untrue hoping to live with him again. Only lately did I discover he was recording the calls to prove himself innocent in court and that is the intention of his calls. Will the call recordings be taken as proof in court?\n\nWhat are the kind of questions we will be asked at time of hearing and what are the things I should be mindful of going forward?\n\nPs. We don't have any children or joint property. However all my jewellery, belonging and dowry given by my parents are in custody of his parents who are refusing to return it. They are also threatening of using political influence to sabotage my life. And I feel stupid to have believed him and not record any calls when he asked me bring money from my parents/ hand over my salary to him, etc.",

        "text": "A guy is harrassing my friend\n\nSo my friend (F19) was in a relationship with this guy for quite a few years.\n\nHe broke up with her claiming she has a lot of male friends in her college.\n\nLater, he messages her asking for money saying \"I spent 10k on you and I need it back\"\n\nShe said \"Why are you doing this?\"\n\nAnd then he showed her photos of both of them making out and said that he will send it to her father.\n\nNow, if her father finds out then it'll be a big problem for her career and he will make her drop out of college.\n\nShe was really scared and gave him the money.\n\nNow, that guys is messaging her again that he wants her to come at his place to do god knows what on Valentine's Day. Or she could pay another 4k Rs by the evening or else he'll send those photos to her father.\n\nShe said she has her exams on 14 and she can't come. Plus she doesn't have anymore money.\n\nThe guy has gone crazy and he's not listening to her.\n\nI told her to tell him that she'll meet with him at her hometown on the day after Valentine's Day (15th) so that me and my boys could get him and she don't have to worry about her exam.\n\nBut he's not in the mood of negotiations.\n\nI told her to grab all the screenshots of blackmailing as a proof. It's the least we can do right now.\n\nWe need real help so I'm open for any advice right now.\n\n**NOTE: BAJRANG DAL IS NOT AN OPTION**\n\n**UPDATE: First of all, thank you to everyone who gave their advice in the comments. I was getting tons of notifications so I couldn't respond to everyone.\n\nI called the guy and told him that we have enough proof to file a case against him, he has no chance of winning. So I basically told him that whatever amount he took from her \"unethically\" by blackmailing her, he must return it before midnight. Or else she's calling the women's helpline tomorrow to mess him up.\n\nYet after all those warnings he was scared enough but still said he ain't gonna pay her back. I did get a call recording of him claiming he did blackmail her.\n\nMy friend was scared a lot but after I showed her the responses from reddit. She's motivated enough to file a case against him. As far as I know, she's been through a lot of physical abuse, harassment and mental trauma by him. I bet you that she won't have a second thought about filing a case against him and she'll ruin him for what he did to her.\n\nThanks to everyone, she can at least study in peace for her exam tomorrow.**",

The contract that I signed with the owner was only made for the first two years. After that the owner was just too busy to create another contract despite me reminding them once. In the original contract, it said that the rent would be 40k with a 10% increment (or mutual consent) for the 2nd year. Now in the 2nd year I didn't bring up the increment and neither did the owner so I continued paying 40k. From the 3rd year onwards the owner increased the rent by 10% every year and I paid accordingly.\n\nNow that I'm leaving the apartment, the owner has realised that they didn't increase the rent in the 2nd year. They are asking me to cover for the increased rent in year 2, and then further 10% increases for year 3 and year 4 on the year 2 base, which is coming out to be ~1.5L more. I'm absolutely not willing to pay so much.\n\nI have already vacated the apartment and moved to a new house so the owner doesn't have that leverage. While I was staying in the apartment I used to drop a message to the owner every month calling out how much rent I was paying. I was never late in my rent payments.\n\nTwo questions \n1. Legally what amount am I bound to pay? The agreement has the words \"The Lessee agrees to pay enhancement of rent of minimum 10% hike (or as per mutual consent)\". This agreement was only for the first two years. I basically stayed for third and fourth year without an agreement.\n2. Out of goodwill what amount should I pay?\n\n",

The least you could do is atleast be supportive even if you have no legal acumen. Please don't  throw around harsh comments or redundant advices.

My son unfortunately killed himself to suicide due to the problems he had after losing his money to gambling on stocks and indices and crypto.\n\nWill the parents be bearing his unsecured Personal debt? \n\nICICI - 10L (14% Interest rate)\nHDFC 3.4L (18% Interest Rate)\nHDFC - 90k (15%) \nHDFC credit card outstanding - 2L\n\nTotaling up to around 17 Lakhs.\nHe was making 46k per month and had a total EMI of 36k.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate :\n\nThanks to everyone for sharing your inputs. Yes, the post is by the \"son\". I'm (24M) tired of this world. Even if it weren't for debt I guess I would've still considered this, debt and quitting job just accelerated my decision making. I've prepared my exit procedure and just wanted to clear a few things before I go to avoid further burden while I'm gone. \n\nI've cried plenty of times at almost every comment shared by people stating that I would hurt my parents when I'm gone.. true.. I won't disagree.. but I know time will heal the emotional pain caused by my death. I've gone through enough posts of r/suicidebereavement to know that healing is possible after this loss and my parents can move on and that's enough for me to give enough reassurance to go on with my decision.\n\nI have a gambling disease. Soon I will start taking loans from other NBFCs and loan sharks or heck I'm capable of even risking my parents'hard earned money and might even lead to them selling their blood sweat built house and other materials to bail me out which would mean a world to them.\n\n Don't wanna live in that world, sure I've failed them as a son but don't want to impact and also project my failure and impact their life's hard work... I'm not going anywhere.. I'm just becoming part of this earth back again.. we're all star dusts after all... I've experienced everything... I've lived my life... Too lazy to fix the problems honestly...\n\nI have never been a good son to my parents or a good partner to my gf who attempted to fix me but failed so hard and hurt themselves too and my Manager at work who had no business or actual need to care about my problem went out of his way to give me enough time despite me deliberately slacking off for several weeks or months on end and yet he kept me and I had to step in our of guilt and applied resignation and lied to him that I'll file for Bankruptcy and still he even helped me saying he'll give 1 month mental health break etc or if I'm sure about declaring bankruptcy then he said he can shorten the notice period down from 2 months to 1 week and I chose 1 week.. end of next week I'll be out of salary too which will motivate me further to proceed with the exit plan.. I had plans of running away from home to like mountains and just live off grid but I don't think my snowflake ass raised in the comforts would adapt also not to forget the trauma I would've caused to people around by just running away, if i don't get killed by the harsh surrounding of living life like that I'd for sure die off guilt..\n\nI just can't change anything about myself for good. Everyone's attempt to get me back on track has only led to wasted time and them getting upset. I've never been a man of my word. Heck never even man enough to face trouble too... I'm done blaming everyone else but myself it's time I realise the root cause and kill it. So hence proceeding with killing the root cause. I have lost all hope... Life is stupid. I might be around for another week or two as materials for my exit plan are on their way. One small temporary pain my family will go through in the next few months and they'll enjoy the rest of their lives.\n\nAgain thank you all for giving me a good cry. Needed it.\n\n",

        "text": "Folks, let's talk about a disturbing trend that's becoming all too prevalent in our society: the glorification of individuals like Elvish and Rajat Dalal. These are not your typical heroes; they're misogynistic, hypocritical, and downright dangerous.  \nTake Elvish, for instance. He's built a massive following on social media with his third-class jokes and boasts in the millions. But behind that facade lies a deeply troubling character. Not only is he a misogynist, but he also recently got away with slapping a boy named Sagar Thakur without facing any consequences. What kind of message does that send to our youth? That it's okay to disrespect and harm others?  \nAnd then there's Rajat Dalal, the criminal who shamelessly broadcasts his illegal activities on Instagram Live. From breaking traffic laws to driving around in a car with no number plate, he's the epitome of lawlessness. Yet somehow, he's managed to strike a compromise with Elvish and another individual named Maxtern. But let's be clear: compromising with criminals should never be acceptable.  \nWhat's truly alarming is the direction our society is headed in if we continue to glorify individuals like Elvish and Rajat. It's a bleak future indeed when misogynistic, casteist pieces of trash are hailed as heroes. As a citizen of this country, it's disheartening to see the values we hold dear being trampled upon by these clowns.  \nAnd let's not forget the role of law enforcement in all of this. The Gurugram police's lackluster response to Elvish's assault and their failure to address Rajat Dalal's criminal behavior is nothing short of shameful. This is not the kind of mediation we need; we need accountability and justice.  \nSo where do we go from here? It's time for us to take a stand against this toxic culture of glorifying misogyny and criminality. We cannot afford to sit idly by while our society crumbles around us. It's time to demand better from our influencers, our law enforcement, and ourselves. Because if we don't, then we're complicit in the downfall of our own society.  \nI, for one, refuse to accept that fate. And if you feel the same way, then it's time to speak up and take action. Our future depends on it.  \n",

This happened a month or two back.\n\nThis happened in TN and I had to go out of state for three months. I got the ₹10k back but due to an emergency I cannot go back to Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe cops from the police station have been calling me to come and sign few documents so that the guy who extorted the money from me can get his job back which I'm totally against.\n\nHe's a criminal and he shouldn't have to be given his job back and that too of police designation.\n\nI want to know what will happen once I go back to the station and sign the said documents. Will he receive further punishment or be given his old job back?.\n\nI want that guy to suffer. He shouldn't be able to threaten anyone else and extort money. What can I do to make him lose his job?\n\n\nEdit : Can any lawyer give me tips or dm on what to do?",

        "text": "Hi Reddit family,\n\nOver the past few months, I’ve been looking for a marriage partner on Jeevansathi and other matrimonial apps. Eventually, I matched with a girl named “X.” At first, our conversations went really well, and I even spoke with her uncle for about 10 days after we matched. I shared her details and pictures with my family to get their approval.\n\nLater, her father came to my home to discuss the marriage proposal. However, at that time, we hadn’t done the kundali matching. My family and her father had a nice conversation about it. In the meantime, we continued talking and getting to know each other, and I started to like her. Things went a bit too fast, and we began sharing intimate photos and having video calls. I made the mistake of doing this before the marriage was even finalized. I was so caught up in the relationship that I promised her I’d marry her soon.\n\nAfter a while, she started acting distant and didn’t seem to care about me. My parents became ill and were hospitalized, and she didn’t even ask how they were doing. Instead, she blamed me for not being in touch with her for a few days. This made me start questioning the relationship. Later, when my family consulted a pandit for the kundali matching, we found out that we’re not compatible.\n\nNow, after 2–3 months, she’s pressuring me to marry her or else she’ll go to the police and file a case against me under IPC 69.\n\nI’m looking for advice on how to handle this situation and would really appreciate any suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Now the beauty of the justice system technically the judge is correct in closing the two cases as per her whims and fancies, but morally when you know the respondent is innocent why not wait to close the 498a first before taking a decision on maintenance because why conclude on maintenance which portrays me as the culprit first and then close 498a. (Mind you the petioner is in no dire need of money, in  the name of upholding her dignity the court will ask you for an arm and a leg)Now I have approached  high court for relief and proceedings and high court as I came to know usually won't conduct as many hearing as lower court and the judgements usually don't change much, In conclusion if the maintenance case judgement was given post the closing of 498a case the verdict would have been different because morally and rationally speaking how can you ask for maintenance from respondent and at the same time try to send him to jail ?( Are our judges really that blind 🤔  ( sorry for the long post)",

        "text": "Bought a builder floor (4bhk) in a 3 floor building in NCR in 2023. All formalities were completed in time and I am the owner right now. However, the builder did keep a ground floor (2bhk) appt with him and is now being little problematic (to say the least) about it. \n\nSince the sale deed was in proper proper Hindi, I missed out on few strange clauses in it earlier which I have found now after putting the whole text in translator. The most weird one is below:\n\n\"Regarding the mentioned floor, the second party will not file any complaint/FIR in the future against the first party in any office or department (such as any police post, station, police station, court, Uttar Pradesh Housing and Development Authority, etc.). If he does so, it will be considered illegal.\"\n\nJust want to understand from people who know law/real estate well, is it even legal to put something like this in sale deed ? And how can it be a problem for me in future ?\n\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEdit 1: Thank you all for your insights on this so far. Really good to know that this clause in the sale deed will not hold water in court. \n\nI have shared this in a couple of comments below but for future readers adding the more context on the builder being a \"little problematic\" part here itself.\n\nThe builder is a little goon-ish type (aren't all ?). He retained the ground floor apartment with him— it is properly illegal, as it was supposed to be full stilt parking. But he carved a flat out from half the parking space, which of course is not sellable now (given it is not on the map and can't be registered). When he couldn't get a deal on it for some time he put some boys there on rent and they are being a nuisance (bringing crowds, creating noise late night, creating smoke by lighting fire inside during winters) for the families living on above 3 floors. They are his relatives so the whole family also visits at times, maybe to show number strength to us.\n\nOne big mistake that we made was we regretfully agreed to not mention stilt parking spot in the sale deed. Because he cajoled us that it will increase the price and the stilt parking, which has space for 4 vehicles, is enough for 3 floors above. He specifically mentioned that the ground floor will not have any rights on stilt parking— I have the full deal conversation on audio (no one knows about it so far and I don't think I can't even use it as per law).\n\nOn complaining about the nuisance that boys create, he says that you are only your floor's owner as per registry so you can't comment on what others are doing inside their home. Now, he also broaches the topic of us using covered(stilt) parking when it is not even in the registry.😒",

He didn't want to work for someone and always wanted his own \"business\", at which he failed repeatedly. I worked several odd jobs from the beginning to support the family, which I'm still doing. I was sad for him, and at a point, frustrated because my salary was never enough for our family of 4. The kids were growing and so were their needs. However, overtime, I made peace with this and never bothered him to contribute to the household. He has never been emotionally supportive either. There was no \"love\" in this marriage, even from the beginning. It's more of a responsibility. Now that I'm growing old my kids made me realize how toxic he is. My health, mental and physical is not in a good shape because of all the negativity and overworking to make ends meet. He's always grumpy and frustrated and doesn't talk properly with any of us. Our home always has this toxic air. Now I want to be able to spend the few years I have left in peace and get separated from him. \n\nI told him so and he said it's because of the money isn't it? It's just about his attitude. My kids are the ones who have been asking me to file for a divorce for years now and I always thought it's fine I'll bear this. But now I cannot. After I mentioned the divorce, he started passing lewd comments about me. He's claiming I have found someone else and is accusing me of infidelity. He's like do whatever you want I will never leave you. He also tried groping me in the wrong places and now I have to sleep with my 16 year old and take her everywhere I go, in my own home. I'm scared for my safety. He drinks every other day and starts blabbering about how he's a leech who will suck my blood till I die. \n\nHow should I go about the divorce? I asked for a mutual one but he said no. I cannot live with this man anymore. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

All his UPI apps were blocked, no password or any information of any payment method was stored in any notes app.\n\nHe had a lock screen, app lock, UPI 4-digit entry pin and 6-digit payment pin before payment. My brother filed a General diary at New Jalpaiguri station. We have the last known location of the phone too(our location sharing in family is always turned on).

I’ll attach the screenshot of the fraud transactions below, we know for sure that the name of the person to which money is transferred is Rooman Hassan and his phone number is: 9205389729.

We never had an account in Paytm, looks like Paytm is doing a lot of automated things, but it still asks for a pin if you want to do the transaction or do a balance check.

        "text": " \n\nI am fed up being a consumer in India with no consideration to consumers whatsoever. I was already sad that my one week old mac suddenly died and on top when I went to the icare store in koramangala, the lady put a big scratch on the top of the case while rotating it on the table to take pictures from all sides. I knew it would scratch the top the moment she turned it upside down and started rotating it on the table and that's what happened. She said the table top is matt finish sir, it wont scratch - how about putting sand particle on it and then rotating on top? i said.\n\nnext, she said she will mention it on the job sheet, but while taking my signature she deleted it. When i got the receipt it didn't say anything about the scratch that she made. Upon confrontation first she said its automated, next she said she forgot to save and now that can't be changed (I have recorded this on phone)\n\nSuch incompetent people all over the country just makes me so angry. On top the icare takes around 10-15 for the same repair which happens on the spot in the US.\n\nI am not letting them go easily, I want to lawyer up and recover lawyers cost from them - any good lawyer, money no bar, who would not dismiss it saying oh its just a scratch. Any personal experience would be helpful.\n\nif need be, i want apple to be liable too, since its an authorized repair shop.\n\nEdit (10th aug 7pm) : contacted apple again since 24 hr was over, they said they need 24 hr more to escalate to level 2 of the store. I am getting a callback tomorrow. will update what happens.\n\nEdit (10th aug 7:10pm): A lady called and said she is from Apple and since my device is within 15 days old she will give me a certificate that there is hardware fault and I can replace it with the retailer, brand new. I asked her to send me a mail regarding this then she said she will discuss with the senior team and get back. I have recorded this call. Not sure if legit.\n\nEdit (10th Aug 9:45pm): Another phone call came from same number, the man said he is from iCare, so I asked was last from the lady also from iCare? he said yes. (and the lady had categorically denied it, and said from official apple). he said the same thing since its within 15 days, we will give a certificate and the Croma online store will take it back. I have the recording. Called Croma they said not possible since 7 days is the policy. Will tell all this in my next call to Apple, probably tomorrow by 5pm.",

For the trouble and the nuisance inside my house, and for not submitting a rent agreement from 2012, they are charging a fine of 75k (not documented). This fine as previously discussed verbally is 2x of the yearly maintenance, I said I will consider it before the amount was declared, and had a few questions on the rent agreement as I am doing this for humanity as my uncle is alone and has no immediate family or an extended family other than me. Without this place he won't have a place to stay/survive. The rent agreement demand was voided as I don't incurr any monetary benefit from him, and would rephrase this as my uncle has been staying at that place as a care taker.\n\nAfter a couple of months I get a call from the secretary to get an update on the payment of the fine amount. On that call I clarified that this request is void as it was requested and enforced due to rent agreement not being submitted, to which the secretary constantly kept saying \"that means you won't pay the amount that you previously promised\"\n\nTo which I responded with a No as the request was void. The matter was undercover for a couple of months more, but now they have added the same ammount under \"outstanding building fund\" which is mentioned without a proper letter from the society. \n\nI need your advice on how to go about this. please help.",

If there is a logo on the carry-bag being sold at the cashier's counter, it must not be chargeable. Additionally, hefty fines have been imposed on the companies and compensation has been awarded to the consumers by the consumer forums. \n\nNext time you go out shopping, don't be an advertising agent at your own cost!",

The agreement was that he pays me the money back in small amounts by pre written cheques wiith future dates for 11 months and on 12th month he will pay back the rest of the amount. No interest involved in this. \n\nFirst month’s cheque was cleared. From second month cheque bounced and stopped answering my phone calls.  I went to his house (which is rented) and found out that he already relocated. \n\nAfter few months he answered my call and keep saying some weird reasons. He refuses to share his new address. I went his home village and did a thorough investigation myself. And found that he is a known fraud. \n\nHe has done this with many people. Now that i have approached an advocate. We had court send him notices to his known addresses but the problem is that they’re never acknowledged. \n\nEverytime I have a posting at the court. It is just a waste of money and time. They are not able to find him and this guy keeps absconding. \n\nOnly proofs i have is: \n\n- 3 cheques which was bounced (small amounts 13,000 rupees) \n\n- hand loan agreement. \n\n- Bank statements that shows i have transferred money to him. \n\nNeed advice on this to get my money asap. Now that I am financially broken and very upset. I know that it was stupid to give him money in the first place.",

        "text": "So today something very weird happened. I placed an order worth around ₹1000 from the Kfc app. There was no option for COD so I paid online. After 1& a half hour I got a call from them say that somehow my order got assigned to 2 riders and one of the rider came and took away my order but didn’t deliver it rather just ran away with it. The person on call told me to cancel order. \n1. There is no way to cancel  an order on KFC app.\n2. I just wanted to get the food I ordered.\nThese points are exactly what I said and he cut the call. I tried to call him multiple times after that and lastly my father had to go to their location to sort it out.  Now comes the weird part.\n\nThey said the rider that came wasn’t the actual rider and it was his brother who misused the ID card to take the order and run away. Even tho it’s not my fault, they still wouldn’t issue a refund as it smhw goes against their “PROTOCOL”. My father threatened with police but the manager just said that the police would get the amount from the rider and give it to us but KFC wouldn’t issue refund. \n\nAfter a lot of to and fro, when my father asked the owner number only then the manager bulged and said they would rather give me my food order than refund. Ok for me so we took it. \n\nMy question is isn’t it KFC’s responsibility to issue refund. My order is with KFC not with rider so KFC should be accountable to me. Am I wrong in assuming this???",

I failed as a logical & practical person which I've been my whole life.\n\n2. I didn't know his real side until I lent him money, he was a good friend, he manipulated me by crying in front of me 1 day and said he might commit suicide if he doesn't gets the money.

It mainly stemmed from physical abuse and mental trauma and harassment I faced from her and to some extent my family also went through lot of anguish as she was trying to frame false police complaints.\n\nWe are physically separated in my house right now, living in separate rooms and she knows that I am preparing to file for divorce. With all this and she not finding any support in her friends and family circle seems to have realized her mistake. She has repeatedly apologized via text messages to me and asking for another chance.\n\nIs there anything like legal mediation under family law where she agrees to certain terms under oath and in court and we continue to live as a family and not break the marriage. We have three kids at stake, two from my previous marriage (I am a widower when I met her) and one (biological) between us.\n\nPlease let me know what are my options legally.",

He was against this and asked me to leave his home if I continue working. In argument I left his home. It's been 2 years and he did not come in person to convince me to return home. He only made calls and told me to return to his home on condition i handover my earning to his parents.\n\nWhen I refused, he has filed divorce petition with false allegations that i left his home without his knowledge (I was onboard bus by him and mil and also have message communication showing i informed him after i crossed each city). Also I caused him physical and mental harm(he is 6ft and well built from years of gym as against me who is 5.5 and weighs 45kgs). He also quoted that I did not take care of his parents properly though that was not the case.\n\nWhat should I do? How to prove I'm innocent. He also has all my things and jewels in his possession which he refused to return.

But not sure how to counter the allegations and concerned about the implications of what would I have to face further.\n\nEdit 2: for those suggesting mutual consent divorce. I had already spoken to my husband through a mediator to just return my belongings and agreed to file a mutual divorce. I clearly said I do not expect any maintenance or money of his. He said he needs some time to think and suddenly I received a court order with all these false allegations.",

        "text": "(Haryana)\n\nI had an Air India flight at 7:30 AM IST in the last week of Dec (Delhi-London), for which my husband and I left home at 2 AM.After an agonising 1.5 hours in queue to check in our luggage and heading to the gates, we get a message 30 mins before boarding that the flight will now take off at 9:30 AM instead.Annoyed, but hoping it will leave at 9:30 AM promptly, we headed to the gate and waited for over 1.5 hours, and by 9 AM we notice a scuffle by the gate, where apparently passengers were told that there is some issue, the airline crew is not ready yet, and the flight will be delayed by another hour or so.\n\nAt this point, we get another message that the flight will depart at 11:45 AM instead.Now, 100+ passengers (including my husband and I), start arguing with the staff, and this escalates into a full-blown fight. At one point they told us, the crew is on their way, please wait 15 minutes. 15 minutes later it was, the crew is undergoing their fitness test, please wait 20 minutes.So on and so forth till 1 PM, when they tell us that there is an issue with the aircraft itself.At this point, we started demanding compensation, and to be put on another aircraft, but to no avail- they reply in the negative to all our requests. The atmosphere is one of agony, of uncertainty, and desperation- we’re not even sure if we’re going to get to London. People are tweeting, tagging Air India, calling consumer helpline numbers, but the Air India staff was completely silent, refusing to give any answers.\n\nPlease note that at this time, we're all hungry, tired (some passengers had come to Delhi from other cities to take this flight), and all air India had given us so far was a measly juicebox each.\n\nMost passengers had connecting flights, hotel reservations, etc which were going to waste.\n\nThe Air India staff (a single, solitary man who was in the firing line), tells us he's going to the ground level to examine the technical issue, and leaves for a good 2 hours.\n\nAnother lady comes, and everyone starts fighting with her as well - until finally, at last, at 2 PM she tells us that an alternate air craft has been arranged that will leave from a different gate.\n\nWe all made our way to that gate and finally, at last, after screaming ourselves hoarse, we got to leave for London at 4 PM instead of the promised 7:30 AM departure. A 7.5 hour unexplained delay for an 8 hour flight.\n\nAll we got from air India was a juice box and a cold sandwich each, and that too after begging them for the refreshments that they legally had to provide us for such delays. No transparency from their end on what the cause of delay was, no remorse.\n\nYou cannot imagine the toll this took on us- we were hungry, sleep-deprived from having awoken at 2 AM, and not given any answers as to what was causing the delay, and barely given any food to tide us over. Not to mention the whole day lost in London due to this delay, reaching London at 8 PM, and having to pay surge fees on an already exorbitant cab ride since we only left the airport at 9 PM.\n\nAfter writing to their chairman, my husband got an email back saying that we're not eligible for any compensation since we got a sandwich and a drink and were eventually put on a different flight. Please let me know what we can do about this and if we can take any action against Air India.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to add: we have video recordings of the scuffle and SMSes of the multiple delays.\n\n  \nEdit edit: We're back in India now",

I am not entirely sure of the details as I don't live with my parents. This lady got her servant to throw away all of my mom's pots without my mom's permission or even informing my mom. My mom was very upset. She used to spend a lot of her time tending to her plants. When my mom asked her why she threw away her pots, she was like those look ugly.\n\nFor the past few months she has been nagging my mom to buy a new shoe rack which we keep near our door too. She says that the shoe rack looks ugly and is right in-front of her house. We are keeping the shoe rack next to our door. Our apartment's door faces her apartment door, we have no where else to keep our shoe rack. She wants us to buy a shoe rack like the one that they own. Their shoe rack costs around 6,000 INR it seems. My mom refused to buy a new shoe rack and she said her shoe rack looks good enough.\n\nFast forward to today. Apparently her daughter is getting married and these people are expecting guests in their house. She goes and complains to the apartment complex's house owner association's president and that guy comes down to our house and starts talking rudely with my mom. He is like if you don't remove the shoe rack by 8:00 PM today, I will get the watchman to throw away your shoe rack. Can he legally do that as the president of the apartment owner's association? Next time something like happens, can we call the police on him? Technically he came into our apartment and was talking rudely to us. What are our legal options in this situation?",

        "text": "Wife is from Rajasthan but we lived together in another state. We separated 5 years ago and then I was embroiled in several cases for 3 years.\n\nHeres the story -\n\nIt was an abusive marriage. She was physically violent, to the point where she would even kick & punch me while i was asleep. Finally got separated when I realized this cannot be fixed even after I requested her for marriage counselling multiple times and she said no.\n\nThe last few months before seperation, I recorded as much as possible and also after our separation. These are audio recordings, messages, calls etc. of her being both physically and emotionally abusive. After 2+ years of separation she lodged an FIR where I presented all the proof, but apparently it still needed to be resolved in the court, so 498a & other related cases on the whole family. And DV Act section 23 was filed later as well.\n\nCurrent status -\n\n498a & other CR. REG. cases - all charges against my family has been dropped with an order saying that her & her dad's story is constantly changing, furthermore no dates mentioned in FIR. She had applied to include my family again with application under crpc 190 but that was rejected by the magistrate. Now the case is running only on me. Its stuck at prosecution evidence stage (2 dates have passed) and they are not showing up in court at all.\n\nDV Act Section 23 - We submitted our financials. She claimed in her affidavit that she does not earn at all (and did not submit ITR or bank statements). Not sure why she did that cause I have her ITR etc. I keep all household data safely - including my whole family's medical history, reports, taxes etc. So I submitted my financials including the fact that she is lying. The court requested her to submit her ITR, since then she does not appear in court at all. After a few days, an order was issued by the court to her to submit the documents and explicitly mentioned the following -\n\nउक्त सुसंगत दस्तावेज जानबूझकर बदनीयतपूर्वक अनुचित उद्देश्य की पूर्ति हेतु प्रार्थी द्वारा माननीय न्यायालय के समक्ष प्रस्तुत नही किया है। (Translation: The above relevant documents have been deliberately and maliciously not presented by the applicant before the Honorable Court to achieve an unfair purpose.)\n\nFurthermore its clear in this order that they need to submit the documents before the next court date. 2 court dates have passed (judge was absent) and on the latest date even their lawyer did not show up. So another date was issued 2 months from now.\n\n\\----------\n\nI am now at a loss. Why was another date given when it was mentioned that they need to submit the documents? What can I do from here if the judge is absent again the next date further extending the date. The case should have been disposed considering even their lawyer didnt show up to represent.\n\nEdit: I need help. I know this is not a big issue like Atul Subhash. But even after all the cases are disposed, they can still approach the high court (I assume). Not to mention the divorce can take years as that is separate from this. I dont know what to do and I am unable to see a future anymore.\n\nEdit 2: I am 35 and she is 32. Their demand is huge (1cr). I cant even give that by giving everything I have + taking loans etc. We have tried negotiating told her how much i can do and they just threatened us by saying they'll drag it out further until we figure it out how to meet their demands. We want to settle this out of court. I want it to end.\n\nEdit 3: I want to know if there is anything I can do. Do I have anyway to move this forward quickly? How can I get my divorce quicker? I think I know all the depressing answers to this, my lawyer has also told it to me. But is there any recourse for me?",

        "text": "A female relative of mine had been working at a bank customer service through external agency. The manager has been pretty abusive to the females working under him. He openly states his dislike for women, pusnishes them for being late by making them stand at the door, not letting them inside neither letting them leave, verbally abuses them without any provocation, tells them to not take any break even for food. Few days back my relative was at work and he came near her and started shouting abuses which included threats of throwing her off from 4th floor. She was fearful and having had enough of this decided to resign then and there. However, his harassment continued on phone asking her to serve 15 days of notice. She felt sick, went to doctor, got some medicines prescribed, came back home and fell down completely paralysed. She was rushed to hospital and through MRI it was discovered she had a brain hemorrhage due to hypertension. She is a young girl in twenties with no history of health issues. \nWe are considering that there should be some action on the manager whose abuses have led her into this situation. We don't know what to be done or how. Can a lawyer or someone with experience provide some advice that can help us?",

        "text": "I’ve seen this being discussed over and over in different forms here. I wanted to bring forth some points which most men tend to forget about marriage, and yes, this is more important than money/properties ever will be. \n\n\nIndia's law still allows men to rape their wives.\n(https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2023/01/09/marital-rape-law-india-supreme-court.html)\n\nNearly one in three women aged between 18 and 49 have suffered some form of spousal abuse, and around six percent have suffered sexual violence.\n\n\nAt the same time, we saw 35.5k dowry cases between 2017-2021; or about 7k a year. Maybe a minority of these are ‘fake’ cases but the total % is minuscule. \n\n\nHonestly, a woman should question why she is marrying someone in India, not the other way around. She is opening herself up to a 33% chance of DV and legalising possibly daily rapes from her husband. \n\nNo normal person wants to get into a live-in/marriage with someone, spending years of their lives, bringing parents etc into it and pouring their time, emotions and effort into it while plotting and scheming in the background. This works both ways of course, for men and women. \n\n\nTwo years is ample time for adults to judge compatibility. If you are with someone that long, marriage is just a tag, you are together. If you don’t feel that after two years, you are simply using the other person.\n\n\nFor all those asking why the laws are so skewed towards women, have you ever protested the exception to the law that allows a rapist to come home to his wife and assault her as he pleases everyday with no legal recourse? Given the 1/3 number for DV, you probably know someone, maybe within the extended family even, that have been DV victims at some point. Do you not see how helpful the laws are for them? \n\n\nWhen two people choose to live together, over time they get accustomed to a certain lifestyle. Typically in India, a woman, working or not, is seen as someone who has to handle a majority of domestic chores, especially if they are living with their in-laws. Please get this into your heads, marriage is not equal to free domestic help. It’s even worse in some backward homes where a woman is forced to leave their job and hence become financially reliant on their partner.\n\n\n In both these cases, and hence I’m addressing a vast majority of marriages/live-ins in India, a woman is sacrificing her time and effort for the household, same as the man when he goes to work. If a woman is working, typically the equation is even more lopsided. \n\n\nConsidering this, the laws are fair and address a majority of the populace. There will be exceptions to every rule but we can all agree that no law can ever be perfect. So please, get into a relationship for the right reasons and treat each other with respect and love (and make sure the extended family does too). 99% of you will then never need to care about such laws.",

        "text": "I was terminated from my job yesterday under the POSH act for reported incidents including inappropriate comments(which I don't remember saying anything offensive) and unwelcomed physical touch (touching their hair) from two female colleagues. My marketing manager(MM) & Sales manager(SM) the day before yesterday called me and told me to accept whatever HR says in tomorrow's meet so I can get my salary and to save my career without any blackmark and told me they will terminate me on other reasons not under POSH. So I agreed to whatever allegations that were put upon me on zoom which they recorded and saved it btw. On the same day MM & SM got me into their cabin told me not to circulate or leak this information as it might damage the company's reputation and female colleagues respect (My respect doesn't matter?) I agreed and got kicked out of the office after submitting the company's assets in the afternoon. In the evening I got an email from HR Head without including my manager(MM) stating that I have been terminated under the POSH act. I didn't reply to the mail cause SM & MM told me they will terminate me for other reasons. So I called my manager today regarding the same and He said he doesn't know about the mail and will give an update after reaching the office. After some time my manager calls constantly and tells me to reply to that mail immediately stating that I did commit everything the female colleagues said and request for salary till my last working day of this month.  I didn't reply to that mail this morning but got constant calls and messages from my manager to reply to it by EOD. (All the calls from my SM & MM were made through WhatsApp so I couldn't record it and benefit from it)\n\nThe two female colleagues are M & R. R is a very close friend of SM and might have got this job on his recommendation which I'm not sure of. On the other hand M is super friendly among everyone It doesn't matter male or female on Aug 15th She herself came up to me and asked for my Instagram handle stating we will be sharing reels to each other. I thought it was cool and agreed, she asked for my number and I gave her my number as well. We chatted and sent reels apart from that nothing very interesting happened. We used to meet in the office and say hi bye. She used to kick me in a friendly way I just touched her hair twice or thrice & she was not fine with it so I stopped touching her hair for 45 to 60 days & she didn't report to her manager(SM) about me touching her hair at that time which she should be doing immediately when she was not feeling comfortable.\nR on the other hand works with me in the same cabin we work together. She constantly gives me attention without me asking for it and I have even told her several times not to stare at me I feel uncomfortable but she didn't listen there were instances where she herself came up to me for help and touch my hands, once she even rubbed her hand on my neck which made me super uncomfortable but I didn't report it to anyone. Just after I got my neck rubbed I just touched her hair I knew she was uncomfortable but she didn't report this to my manager(MM) as well and I never touched her hair again. This happened 45 to 50 days ago. And even R didn't report to her manager about this thing at that time.\nI was performing well in my job we could see a growth and my three month probation period was over. I asked for a salary hike and my manager approved that same on the 5th of this month. Only me in my team got a hike after probation. My team was not happy with it I could clearly see. Lost in touch with M & R completely used to ignore them most of the time as I was interested in other girls. During this time M & S got along so well they spent so much time together in the office. But R didn't stop frequently staring at me for no reason. Last Saturday R stared at me for a longer than normal period of time so I had to ask her what? What's wrong? Do your work. She responded to the same thing that got me pissed. We both were taken into the manager's cabin where we fought there in front of the managers as well she grabbed her laptop and said she will hit me with it. I couldn't control my anger,I said If you do, I will slap you right in front of both managers. We both came to a conclusion and apologized and agreed that we won't bother each other. \n\nI took the day off on this Monday. My both female colleagues M & R teamed up together with some other female colleagues and each one of them themselves went into SM cabin to explain to him about my behaviour and each one of the female colleague had problem with my behaviour and attitude. The only evidence to prove their statements are either other females colleagues saw or heard the conversation. Even though there are CCTV and voice recorders are installed both managers SM & MM are not willing to check and confirm. When R comes to explain about my behaviour or complains M is the only witness she has and when M comes to explain only witness she has is R. The complaints are that I have touched their hair, I have asked them weather they have watched porn or not. Me asking about their sex life are the allegations that are added on me and their evidences are their female colleagues itself. These allegations didn't happen recently it was happened way before maybe they should have said reported it to their managers right away but now they all teamed up all at once and each one of them all of a sudden had problem with my behaviour attitude and everything. \nPlease help in this regard and provide some insightful information if you faced the same. I will be open to respond all this night and day as im unable to sleep and I'm getting suicidal thoughts since the day I was terminated. ",

        "title": "rape on pretext on marriage",
        "text": "The concept of \"rape on false pretext of marriage\" raises several important questions and concerns. Why are women perceived as less capable of making their own choices? Some argue that women are manipulated, but are adult women not capable of making their own decisions? If a woman lies before being intimate, why can't men also file similar complaints?\n\nWomen should be held responsible for their actions. This outdated mentality that women are inherently less responsible stems from traditional beliefs. Historically, if a couple engaged in premarital sex, men were often pressured to marry the woman, as if she bore no responsibility for her own actions.\n\nIf the issue is lying and cheating, then why is it registered as rape? It could be classified as deception or fraud instead. Societal changes must be acknowledged; our society is increasingly adopting Western norms, including live-in relationships, premarital sex, and a rise in hookup culture. Laws should evolve to reflect present realities rather than past values.\n\nGenuine rape laws are crucial, but punishing consensual sex under false promises is problematic. An adult woman can choose to have sex and should also bear responsibility for that choice. Moreover, the burden of proof often lies on the man to show he did not promise marriage, which is difficult to prove.\n\nIf a woman values her virginity highly, she has the option to refuse and report harassment rather than engage in consensual sex. There are both \"gross\" and \"good\" men regarding views on virginity, and women should not seek validation from those who judge them based on such criteria.\n\nSociety's perspective on premarital sex is evolving, and if someone is bold enough to engage in it, they should also be able to ignore societal judgments. The stigma around virginity is less significant compared to the severe consequences men face due to false accusations.\n\nWestern societies, which we are increasingly emulating, do not have similar laws. These laws are not reflective of the current societal context. Women are fully capable of making informed decisions, and laws should not infantilize them.\n\nFalse accusations should not go unpunished as they can ruin lives. Although some feminists argue that punishing false accusers may deter genuine cases, it is essential to address the high rate of false accusations to maintain justice.\n\nPolicies should be based on current realities, not historical grievances. We need to move forward and ensure equality for all genders. Addressing discriminatory laws and practices is crucial for genuine progress towards gender equality.\n\nEven courts are concerned today seeing number of fake cases increasing day by day.The statistics are shocking.\n\nAND IF ITS 100 PERCENT PROVED THAT IT wAS FAKE CASE..I DONT SEE ANY REASON AS TO WHY THE FRAUDSTER SHOULD GO UNPUNISHED. \n\nyes there r still ppl making virginity of women a big deal.but it is being fought.several movies have come up and people are being vocal.so why not even go against such discriminatory laws too?\ni know this country is way behind gender equality..but that doesnt mean we start propagating something wrong.aim for equality from both sides.criticise anything that is discriminatory against any gender.\n\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/reel/C1tzkMwpoX6/?igsh=MWdrN3Q2cjd5YmQ2MQ==\n\n\n\nWomen are free to make bad choices, like men. \nAre they saying it’s illegal  to change your mind about marrying a particular person.\n\nWHY ARE WE LIVING IN THE PAST?",

        "text": "My girlfriend and I have been together since 2014 and we got married in early 2022. A few months before our marriage, I had some suspicious that she was cheating on me. Since it was a long relationship i didn't want to end it based on a suspection but everytime I had confronted her, she'd gaslight me into thinking that I'm some psycho and no one would love me because i have a suspicious and perverted mind. He was her friend and work colleague after all and I felt terrible considering that this guy was married and has a daughter too. This guy would come home from time to time to have a drink with us since his wife didn't know he drinks and our house was a place where he felt safe. I couldn't object to this at all. I confided in a few friends who know her as well and they all told me that I'm over thinking things because there's nothing that proves that she's cheating. With all this I felt guilty and proceeded with the wedding as there was absolutely no support from anywhere and I had nothing apart from a hunch that she was cheating. After marriage there were still behaviours that were very off and everytime I confronted her, she'd made me feel so terrible for asking her these things. I  had also been slapped multiple times for asking her such demeaning questions to a point where I started believing that I'm mad and began therapy to fix my fucked up head... Nothing was working, I was still plagued by suspection so i did something extremely unethical. I installed a spy camera in our home that would broadcast to my phone. My intention was that if theres nothing going on, I'll know for sure that I'm an obsessive over thinker and can actually start more intense therapy, this time believing that i actually have a problem, but I wanted proof that I'm wrong...\n\nA month had passed. There was an evening where we were both invited to a friends house for dinner. She had a webinar to present along with her boss and was assisted by the guy I was suspecing her with. She asked him to come home that afternoon for lunch so that they could both prepare for the evenings presentation. I had to be ok with this because it was work. In the evening she suggested that I'd go and spend time with our friends while she's giving the webinar as I'd have nothing to do at home until shes done, and I could come pick her up once she's done... The venue was only 4kms away from our house so it all made sense for me to go and come back later to get her.\n\nWhile i was at my friend's house we were ordering food and they had asked me what to get for my wife. I thought I'd call her but it had been 10min since the webinar had started so i thought I'd call up the guy instead to ask and get back to me. \n\nMy phone was in the room charging. I went to get it to make the call. By accident, my finger slipped and I opened the spy cam app instead of the phone app and I was just about to close it when I notice them fucking, WHILE THE WEBINAR IS TAKING PLACE... The both of them were in front of their laptops, answering QNA's in the chat while switching sex positions. She didn't lie, there was an actual webinar and she was actually typing out responses... I felt an immse sense of relief right there. For the first time in 2 years, I felt sane. I was right all this time. I quickly screen recorded the entire thing and then proceeded to call him pretending not to know anything... I called, she picked up and told me what she wanted while stroking his dick. She also told me that the webinar is almost done and shes only answering QNA's and that I can leave in 5min to come and pick her up. She hung up after saying \"I love you\" and continued blowing him till he came in her mouth... I was so shocked at how well she was able to lie so effortlessly... \n\nI left to my house, reached and pretended to be completely clueless about what I just saw on my phone. She greeted me and said that the session went well, grabbed her purse and we both made our way to the car. I had to maintain my cluess and calm facade so while we were walking downstairs, I leaned in an kissed her (something that we do everytime we going down the stairs). After kissing her, I said \"eww, why does your mouth taste like dick?\" ... She got furious and started the same guilt trip and said that I'm driving her insane and I need some serious psychological help and that she's fed up with me and my suspicions... I apologised and said I didn't mean anything Ill, I just made a genral obversation. She understood, apologised for snapping and we went to our friends for dinner...\n\nThat's when I realised that i married a master manipulator who's a freakn psycho...\n\nHere's where I feel stuck! I haven't confronted her yet. It's been about 2 weeks since this happened. I made up some story that I'm needed at my dad's house in Hyderabad for some family property matters and I've been stayin here ever since. The only proof that I have about her infertility is the video, which i obtained from a spy cam that I placed in our hall without her consent and this could easily back fire on me as a pornography case or anything else since I'm a man and she's a woman... \n\nI don't know what to do.",

        "text": "My friend applied for his passport renewal over nine months ago through BLS International, as required by Indian embassies abroad. Despite numerous follow-ups, he has only been told that his application is “with the embassy,” with no updates or resolution. Attempts to contact the embassy have gone unanswered, leaving him stuck in limbo.\n\nThis isn’t an isolated case—passport delays disproportionately affect Kashmiri applicants, who often face processing times of 7 months to over a year, compared to the typical 1-2 months for others. Even his initial passport application in Srinagar faced similar delays, pointing to a concerning pattern of systemic discrimination.\n\nThese delays go beyond inconvenience—they’re dangerous. Applicants abroad are required to submit their existing passports, leaving them vulnerable in emergencies, while those applying from within India often miss valuable opportunities due to prolonged delays. This lack of transparency, accountability, and fairness raises serious concerns and may violate fundamental rights under Articles 14 and 15 of the Indian Constitution, which guarantee equality and non-discrimination.\n\nHe is seeking legal advice to address this systemic issue, not just for himself but for the many Kashmiris who endure these delays in silence, often out of fear of retaliation. He asked me to post on his behalf as he is apprehensive about drawing attention to himself or his family.\n\nAny advice on legal recourse, relevant laws, or organizations that could assist would be immensely helpful. \n\nThank you for your time and support!\n\n",

We had discussed his options for leaving substance many times. most of the time it led to fights. which later got sorted with a promise of chnaging his ways. \nthere was no change on his part neither prior to marriage nor after. \n Soon he proposed to me. Because of what was happening  I was very unsure about this alliance. \nHe introduced me to his family and they were very eager for this marriage.  He insisted that we lived with his parents after marriage.\n\nMy parents were against this marriage. But he was able to somehow convince me against my better judgement. \nI had bad feeling about this marriage since the day it was being discussed. I was extreamly stressed and anxious before and during this marriage.\nI  did not want to go through this marriage, i even said so several times but he and his family were able to convince me everything will be ok after marriage.\nI have been feeling sick since the marriage. All hopes I had all those promises of changing have been  brutally murdered. \nHe has slapped me on several occasions before as well as after marriage.even when he is not under the influence.\nHe berates me in front of his family, and his family doesnt stop this.

        "text": "\nIt all started a month ago when I received a gas cylinder bill of ₹940.50. So, I brought ₹940 to the person (I didn't had change), and he started arguing with me, saying, \"mere sahab aise nahi lete hai, sirf 1 rupaye hi padta hai.\" I didn't have any idea how INR rounding off works back then (FYI: 50 Paisa rounds to the nearest bigger amount if this arises), but what we study in our maths is (6.5 ---> 6 and 5.5 ---> 6; odd goes up by +1). Yesterday, I received it for this month, and the guy was trying to flee away with my ₹2 loss. When asked, he started saying, \"agli baar lelena, bhaag thodi jayenge, kaisi baat kar rahe hai.\" (This plug-in was to show how they make you feel guilty if you ask for your 1 or 2 rupees back, and when the situation reverses, they make you feel guilty again.) The main concern is if this amount is added for two months, it comes out to ₹1881. The gas cylinder is supplied in major amounts to almost every house in India, and if this high amount of ₹0.50 is multiplied, it will actually be a very big amount. Again, I am not sure how these things work; I was curious to know public opinions.",

        "text": "\nWe went to the Police Station yesterday to file a complaint against the guy.  After thorough investigation by the Police, a written statement was taken from me, and the guy was asked to come down to the station. When he was called for the first time, he said he would be there within 30mins so we waited. He was called again after 45mins, and this time he said his manager would be coming instead. We waited 45mins more for his manager to come and no sign of him either. By this time the delivery guy’s phone was switched off. After waiting for 30mins more, his manager was phoned and asked to come down to which he agreed. 1more hour passed, the cops started getting pissed as both were fooling the police now by saying one of us will come in next 10-15mins and still no sign of either of them. The manager was called again as to know why he is not bringing the delivery person, his answer was that – ‘sir, he is scared’. This was the same delivery person who was confidently smiling and saying I could complain wherever I want, to whomever I want to, and nothing would happen. Where was his showy bravery now? Anyways, after making the Police unit wait for 3.5hrs they both finally arrive at the station. The delivery guy’s statement was taken. As he was giving the statement, he started addressing me as Madam. His whole demeanor had changed,from being pompous to suddenly a respectful man. The same man that disgustingly remarked on me being alone at home and wanting to know what I was doing, the same guy laughing and smiling while denying the order and enjoying the part where I still wanted the order and was asking him to stop. No right-minded delivery agent asks what you are doing inside alone just because you are late to open the door and especially after noticing that you in fact are alone. At most they will ask what took you so long, show some frustration on their face. So, it was none of this freak’s business to comment on whether I was alone or not which was just blind sided by some people here because they wanted to shift the entire blame to me and sympathize with the delivery guy. Well, guess who had the last laugh now (referring to someone saying that I harassed the guy and if he had complained against me, what would happen and who would have the last laugh) after the Police detained him and now a petty case is on his way, unless I request them not to file one. His arrogance that his misbehavior, teasing won’t be taken seriously and that too by the Police? A lesson was taught. I have also posted on twitter, emailed Amazon’s grievance officer, nodal officers, customer executive regarding the incident as told by some people. Thanks to all you people who thought that this was a genuine concern and provided your inputs on what I should do next.\n\nTo the other set of people here who said that I felt entitled cause I have money, It was not harassment, I am the one who harassed the guy, I am overreacting, ‘YTA’, I am looking for validation, I am whining, I am taking it to the next level by making it about women’s safety, I need to do this on twitter instead of reddit, I was desperate for the order, labelling as borderline classism and what not. I am just glad that I didn’t listen to your comments. And what had to be done is done by the Police. I pray for the women in all your lives and I hope a day doesn’t come in your life where some stranger that just needs to do his assigned job comes to your door and says to your sister/mom/any woman in your life- ‘pata nahi akheli kya kyakarri hai andhar’ cause they were late and also starts mocking, teasing around with the order and has no fear of consequences. I say this cause these women disappointed in you all. This man made the Police wait for 3.5hrs. Guess who is the entitled one now? And yes, like someone commented Respect goes both ways, thali dono hath se bajti hai, I agree with you. In no way he was respectful to me in the entire incident, so I gave back what I got from him.",

(Both my parents working so only us in the home).\nSince some months seeing her outing a lot. She says its with her friends. AFAIK, almost all of them have even left the city itself and some live out of city for work. \n\nOk, now main problem. My parents went to the relatives due to relative marriage and leaving us alone. \nA week ago, saw at night heard weird noices from my parents bedroom, went to hall saw fluid and tried peeking in the room, saw my sister DOING IT with some guy, was shocked and angry as she was more excited behaving like slut. The guy was ugly looking like begger\nI was so angry that i wanted to slap and beat her . \nI controlled, we weren't talking as till afternoon i was in school (curricular project) and till evening when she was in home i to not see her face was in my room doing dinner. \nI was thinking what to do, so I don't regret later, but now after the incident happened  yesterday i am not able to even process my mind. \n\nYesterday, the guy came again in late night, after some time i went again to peek in the room, i cried , i saw her with two men. Raw doing her, and one was literal uncle. She was being did by both and she was enjoying it. I am not fully sure but i\n Think they did cum in her. My mind was just stuck, i was not able to comprehend anything. I was just seeing her and crying and not knowing what i can do. \n\nI tried talking her , she denied saying she don't have time and went outside to meet her 'FRIENDS ',  as she said. \n\n\nShe is cheating with her husband as one day her husband called me asking if everything is fine as she isn't picking his call. \n\nMy jija(brother husband) ,  is literally very sweet ,innocent and kindest person i ever meet. \n\nAfter getting married to my sister, he even got seperated from parent home and bought new home. And he do treat her like princess. \n\nI have lost all respect for my sister after yesterday. (I had some before yesterday) . \nShe is not my sister, 😭 , whom do i tell. \n\nWhom do i tell it to. And will they believe me. Also what if she denies afterwards . I dont even know i am too scared. \nIts not even 5 years in their marriage. \nAnd let me say i will do anything to protect my brother in law from my sister. She isn't my sister anymore. \n\nYou don't know how bad and uncomfortable i am feeling seeing her yesterday. \n\nMy hands are shaking typing. \n Please dont delete this mod. I have no where to find solution. \nI posted here because i have no mature people to talk to. \nShe was just now, fighting with me telling me to go out tomorrow afternoon as her  friends will come to party. I know what party and what friends. I am dying from the trauma inside and on top of that her lying, .\n\nShe is a slut, whore,  you just peek in her room you will now find her masterbating.\n\nIt was  worse than any breakup. I feel like God would have just killed me instead of showing the real face of my sister. Or killed her. It would have been so less disturbing , .\n\nI can't live with this trauma,",

        "text": "\n25F I set a strong boundary that he should not go after my Bra, 31M he said “Okay”, but then he didn’t stop, after some mins, He unhooked it without my permission, I said No multiple times 10-15, I was clearly uncomfortable, he kept pressuring me until I gave in out of fear, for he didn’t stop, his words were, “Hey Hey Hey Please please Hey Hey Hey Consistently”…. and forced me to remove it under pressure by consistently ignoring my NO…, I gave in out of fear and I was scared and I just wanted to get through the night. When he hid my eyes and enjoyed himself, with his mouth on my breasts, I froze in Fear—I couldn’t move or react, Like a Dead Body I froze (trauma response) He didn’t care if I’m Okay, if I’m comfortable, absolutely Nothing, My eyes were hidden and he did it……. Then, I fawned (which is trauma response)—hugging and kissing him, trying to find comfort, safety, and trust in an unsafe situation. And again I froze when he kept his mouth on my breasts. I questioned him the next day that why he forced me, and he admitted that he forced me knowingly ( but he said it wasn’t preplanned and he did it on the moment, Anga yaara eruinthalum apditha agi erukum, his words were, any man would have done the same in that place, such a disgust comment ( what was I an Object ?, that’s how it felt ), He excused himself with his words “I did you wrong but I’m not a wrong man” “why did you allow me to your home”.\n\nEven If it wasn’t my home, it would’ve still happened to me in any other day, at any other place, at any other time. It doesn’t have to be my home at night. The least respectful thing, he could’ve done is value my NO, but to him, “his desire” felt more important than my consent and comfort. \n\nEven though he admitted to forcing me but then he shifted blame and avoided accountability and said, \"At least you should have stayed in control.\" ( I told him I feel unsafe and I wanted to be alone, rather than addressing my feelings of unsafety, this was his opportunity to say “Ennakum thaniya tha erukanum nu thonuthu”, He betrayed me in days shortly afterwards, like use and discard ). Days before this incident, at his home during day time, he tried to remove my top by force, I said NO, he tried to remove it again, I held it tight so he stopped, he said to me, It must’ve triggered ur past trauma, I won’t ever do like that again. I thought what a good man, I trusted him and respected him enough to allow him to my home, when he asked me if he can visit mine, but now as he got awareness that removing it on his own despite NO, is clear violation, he coerced me by consistently pressuring me into it….\n\nHis Friends made excuses for his actions and invalidated me saying, “Forcing is wrong but it’s not preplanned, it’s situational and another one said, he must’ve had different intentions.” \n\nHe admitted that he did not Love me and he made false promises of marriage recklessly. The fawning and freezing was trauma response. Fawning was my brain, trying its best to find comfort and safety in him, after freezing where I went absolutely Frozen, unable to move. ( Him repeatedly ignoring my NO caused me to relive flashbacks of my past SA from Childhood, I had Flashbacks of it, when he repeatedly ignored my NO that is how much he forced me). It hurts a lot the trauma, Couldn’t express in words, it’s been months, He is Ex Boyfriend.\n\nIs this legally considered as a crime, in India \nBut I feel like I’d probably be victim blamed. \nJust cause I trusted him to Allow him to my home, doesn’t mean I owed him Sex / Sexual Activity.\nwe both mutually agreed on our Limits, from the beginning of relationship. \n",

I found that my nephew had accounts on many different websites and social media platforms like facebook, instagram, twitter, youtube, dicord and many gaming sites. I also found that he had several friends on internet some of which were adults and he was watching adult and sexual content on internet.\n\nI was very worried and complained to his parents who are my close relatives. The parents did not do anything. They were feeling proud that their son was an expert in internet, computer and smartphone.\n\nI have been a school teacher and was really worried about my nephew and my daughters. I wrote a letter to principal of Springdales School Pusa Road where my nephew studies and asked her to protect the students of her school from this type of dangerous activities. I also sent links to the accounts of my nephew and his risky behaviour on internet with my letter. At first the principal ignored my letter. My nephew again tried to force my daughters to use youtube channel. So I sent a reminder to the principal of his school.\n\nThe principal replied saying that this was my family dispute and the school will not interfere. I was very shocked and wrote back to her asking why she was calling this a family dispute and was it not the duty of the school to protect its students from all bad influences. The school principal got very angry and sent me a threatening letter accusing me of harrassing the school and its students and that she has complained against me to the police. Here is her letter:\n\n>I am sending your mail to the cyber safety cell.  \n>  \n>As you are not a part of springdalian family you have no buisness to harass my students aren't or staff.  \n>  \n>We have found out in details and there is no aorta of truth in your allegations.  \n>  \n>If I recieve any such mail further it will be a matter of police and cyber enquiry.  \n>  \n>Stop this harassment.\n\nHer earlier reply had her signature but not this reply. This is also poor english and it not a proper format of a letter. I am very disturbed at the attitude of the school principal.\n\nHow can she say that I am harassing? Can she complaint against me for informing the dangerous activities of the student. What should I do?\n\nI want to also ask if there is some authority to which I can send complaint about this risk use of internet by underage children specially because the school principal and parents are not doing their duty?",

Either put base price high and remove your handling+delivery fees Or just take those charges but only on the base price of the food which is same as the one for dine-in.\n\nEdit: some are misunderstanding a little. If these are providing a platform, then that's what this handling fee is for. That I'm totally fine with. But raise the base price of the dish, that's the main issue here. If you want to charge for the service, mark them as separate charges. Charging the food at a higher rate is just a way to mislead the consumer, instead charge that amount as your separate fee.",

        "text": "Hii i am 20F living at home. I wil not go into specifics but when i was young my father threatened to unalive me 3 times....once when i was around 7 to 9 years(beacusei was playing with some less fortunate and poor kids).....again when i was 14(beacuse i scored 63% in finals ) and then when i was 16(i had a boyfriend). Though i was scared at that time but now I was not that scared. Recently he threatned my sister that he would beat her to death beacuse she has habbit of lying ( cant blame her..my mother beats her that's why she is scared to admit even small things like doing some crafts with lipstick). Donr have the time to mention other abuse and torture that i went through. \nI tried recording but i froze. I am really scared. My views is completely different from them like all other indian parents. I am really scared if they find out anything that they dont agree on then my father can actually kill me as i am an adult and i am hard to control .\nI want to know if i can legally choose not to stay in contact with them in future.\n\nEdit 1 - i live in a small town...my father threatens to bribe the police to keep shut....i am not looking for any quick solution as i am not in any danger right now.....i just want to stay prepared. Just want to know if i can legally stay in zero contact from my parents. And also which documents to keep with me.\n\nEdit 2 - Dont want to fight legally. Not interested in taking any legal actions.\n\nEdit 3 - parents do want us to become successful but want to control us too.",

        "text": "I(32M)Always wanted to own a hand gun. The local police say that they will approve only in case of a threat to life cases etc which I have none of. I need it only for self protection. They suggest for pepper spray which I have no interest of. \nHave seen Gujarat High court ruling that police cannot stop citizens from owning guns as right to self protection is guaranteed in our constitution. What is the supreme court's view on self protection? I stay in Bangalore(if relevant). What is the right way for me to approach the police to get their approval?\n\nEdit: To add more context. The police response time in my city is 30 min on average. If I take smaller towns or villages it's much worse. I have heard stories of tech guys getting robbed at knifepoint on \"outer ring roads\" during night(not even isolated cross roads). When I come home on bike after my second shift I need much more than pepper spray. Running away is not my strong point with having asthma. Seeing most of the comments I feel that the guarantee of life of aggressor is more important than the victim. I believe when my life is threatened with a weapon(knife, machete or gun) I have all the rights to counter it with  deadly force through a gun. Additionally, mob justice is a thing in India. 10 hits with a stick or stone then I am close to dead. Doesn't have to be that mob comes to me with a gun. Sticks are enough to kill a man by 10 idiots. A gun will atleast guarantee me a fighting chance. \n\nPlease answer legally. Most are answering emotionally as to what they feel about gun laws. ",

        "text": "I (36 f) have been separated from my husband (40) for over a year now. He is an alcoholic who was physically, verbally and sexually abusive. I told my parents about his abuse about 6 months before I was able to leave him. My parents and I talked about me leaving him, but i was also afraid to take a big step. We have 2 kids also 6 y o and 2 y o. My parents live abroad while I lived with husband and his family in india. My parents told my maternal uncle about this and he had told me to let him know if i needed help. \n\nIn Nov 2023, my husband and I and kids went to a family wedding and my uncle was there. He took my husband aside and scolded him and told him he should be good and stop drinking or else my uncle will help me get away from him. My husband was deeply offended that my uncle scolded him and when we came back from the wedding, his abuse and torture escalated. I immediately called my parents and they flew down to india, and along with my uncle and another uncle who is a lawyer, they brought the police. I wrote a police complaint (not FIR, only written complaint as a letter) and left with my parents, along with my kids in early December 2023.\n\nI went with my parents to the country where they live, and i was fully transparent to my husband and his family about where we are. They do video calls with children at least 5 days in a week. Husband knows our address and has ordered cake and toys for the children a few times in the last year. Just to add, he has not sent any money or anything like that since we left and i have not asked either. I started working again (i had stopped before marriage) and i am sending my kid to school and managing other expenses with my parents help. My parents don't live in a western country where it is difficult to get visa or where flights are expensive. Visa is on-arrival for $50 and there is a direct flight from mumbai. My husband and inlaws are upper middle class and well able to afford it. I have invited them all to come and visit the children whenever they want. I don't want anything to do with them but I have no intention of keeping the kids from them.\n\nEvery other week, my husband sends random ranting messages to me insulting me and my family members and friends. Recently he started messaging disgusting things directly to my family and friends too. They all sent me screenshots and i told them to ignore and block him. Only i have not blocked his number for the sake of the kids. Last night he sent a message to me that my uncle tried to r*pe his sister two years ago when we had gone to my parents' hometown (in india) for my 2nd delivery. He has been angry at my uncle because of his scolding, and every now and then he calls him derogatory names, but this is going too far. His sister is a 42 years old and unmarried but in a good job and a smart woman. I sent her his message screenshots and she said 'so sorry, i will scold him'. He obviously sent this without her knowledge. It's bad enough he is defaming my uncle, but also his sister? \n\nAnyway, i guess her scolding also hasn't helped because he is continuing to say the same thing about my uncle, and also saying my uncle might have tried to do the same to his own daughters (he has 2 daughters). I have ignored all of his other disgusting rantings (he called my father a chakka, and my sister a prostitute for working night shift - she is an emergency doctor), but this is really unbearable for me. \n\nCan I file a defamation case just from his text messages?

He's asking to vacate it in a month or two with a compensation of 1.5 lakhs. \n\nHow he came to this figure of 1.5 lakhs? When my father rented this shop in 1985, he paid a deposit of 20,000. The landlord says he had discussed (with my father's elder brother) that at the time of vacating, he'll pay the deposit + interest at the rate of bank. IMP: Neither he nor my father has any paperwork related to this.\n\nBut I think both the money and the time given is way too low for a shop rented for 40 years. Any advise please, what are our legal options? Please help.\n\nPS: Me and my brother are now employed with good salaries. The shop is not the primary source of income for my family. It's more like my father has been doing this for 40 years and can't just stop all of a sudden.\n\nEdit: Ok the comments here are not what I expected. I don't understand why people are so angry nowadays. Shameful, entitled? Jumping to conclusions straightaway. I was just asking for advice here. No I don't think I am the owner. No I don't think I should be paid some hefty amount of money. I just wanted inputs on what tenancy laws say in such cases.  But some comments are just non-helpful, jumping to conclusions. Thanks for the rest of you who gave honest advice.\n\nEdit 2: Am I wrong in assuming the landlord can't just ask someone to vacate their shop after renting for such a long period. There's got to be some time window given so that the tenant can have some backup source of income prepared?\n\nEdit 3: What makes me think I should get money as compensation? Because that's what the landlord and we had agreed on at the time of renting. ",

        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\n\n\nI need some advice on dealing with an issue I’ve had with Flipkart regarding a defective product and the company’s refusal to accept a return or refund, which they are justifying based on a closed return window that, in reality, lapsed due to their own delays.\n\n\n\n**Background**\n\nI ordered a pair of CMF by Nothing Buds Pro 2 from Flipkart, delivered on \\*\\*13th Oct 2024\\*\\*. The earbuds upon usage showed signs of overheating and honestly they just dont fit me comfortably. They fall off and cause a massive pain, I have done all the steps necessary here but they are not made for my ear cavity. I raised my concerns immediately through Flipkart’s support app, but the response was painfully slow, with multiple deflections and delays until the return window eventually closed.\n\n\n\n\\--\n\n\n\nThe product was delivered as part of Flipkart’s “open box” policy, where the delivery agent briefly allows you to inspect the item. However, their agent insisted that I “just open the box and let him leave,” giving me no chance to check for heating or fitting issues, which of course only became apparent after trying to use the product. I did try to use but none of these things are visible within that small timeframe, and they keep telling me to approach the freaking service centre. \n\n\n\nWhen I raised the complaint within Flipkart’s support app, I was continuously redirected to the brand, asking me to go through a long service-center verification process. This process, that can easily stretch 20–40 days—a timeline that makes the return policy feel entirely useless, especially for a product that is clearly defective.\n\n  \nI also took this up with the \\*\\*National Consumer Helpline\\*\\* to escalate the matter. Unfortunately, Flipkart has continued to brush off responsibility, pointing to the closed return window, which they themselves allowed to expire due to their mismanagement.\n\n\n\nDespite multiple complaints raised with Flipkart from day one, I received only boilerplate responses until they finally informed me that my complaint was closed due to the return window being over. Their response included the following message:\n\n\n\n\\> “Since the product was delivered on 13 Oct 24 and it’s post return policy, we regret to inform you that the seller will not initiate the return request. We request you to kindly get in touch with the brand. If the brand doesn’t help, kindly share the Job sheet or denial letter. Hence, we are closing the complaint.”\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel that Flipkart has engineered their policies to deny consumers the right to returns, making this process incredibly difficult and stressful. If anyone has advice on what steps I can take—whether through Flipkart or legally—to compel them to resolve this fairly, it would be greatly appreciated. Should I pursue this further with consumer court, or are there any other options I should consider?\n\n\n\nThank you for any guidance.",

Since he is young he doesnt really know what to do or what not to. This lead him to scratch the seat of scooter (not maliciously but as a way to sharpen his claws) . We do have a scratch pad at home but when hes outside he would rather use the scooter seat than come home.  \n\nMain: So today the owner of the said scooter went of the rails. He claims my cat did a lot of damage to his scooter seat. Said he will do something do my cat the next time he see him. So i thought it was an empty threat, dogs barking. But it wasnt. As my cat was coming home he went ballistic. He got a stick and tried to injure my pet. Lucky my cat was fast and escaped. And i saw all this. I gave him a piece of my mind. Asked how can he be so cruel to a small defenseless cat. Why are you so violent over a seat of a scooter. He wasnt having any of it. Finally told him he is mentally ill and he should go to a doctor. That shut him up. He left. I went home after a while . My cat came home.  \n\nSo the deal is what can i do next? the society has cctv but there are few blindspots. If i were to pull my phone the next time his behavior would change. In the verbal exchange he verbatim said he would kill the cats if he has to. I heard it. The watchmen was standing there also heard it (but i dont think hes on our side). Maybe the cameras did too.  \n\nTldr: can I do something against an asshole who has an intention to hurt my pet ?",

Isn't this a one sided law that creates more stress on the employer and discourages hiring married women? I feel like I should no longer hire married women because of this one horrible clause. My company is a service based company. People are required to run the business. We make money on margins. It's not a product business that it can scale easily just by increasing quantity of products. My company is not very big to sustain such random expense. Is there a way to navigate around this? I have found a good candidate but she is a married woman. I don't want to keep endlessly going paying out money with no resource + payout + additional employee to get that persons job done. Please help.",

        "text": "So someone suggested me to put this question here so I've reposted the same here.\n\nYup, I guess the title almost explains itself. Actually these days, I have encountered a wave of posts discussing the unfairness of Indian laws towards men.\r  \n\r  \nI'm pretty sure that this topic has been discussed in this sub before, but I couldn't find the post, hence I created one myself.\r  \n\r  \nSo, my question is, if a couple have sex with consent from both the parties, on what parameters can the woman sue the man? If she can, at all?\r  \n\r  \nSecondly, if one has to play it safe, what measure should he take so as to at least nullify at least some, if not the whole charges? Like when I got down to brainstorm, I came up with a stupid idea of getting a voice recording or maybe a chat screenshot where the guy can make it clear that they're having sex with consent/not under the promise of marriage. I know, I know it's a childish solution, but that's all I could think of? Other than this i don't know how can an average male get out of the police case?\r  \n\r  \nLastly, what more solutions are there to protect one self from this tyranny? I'd be grateful if someone can provide me with some stats as to how much do these charges affect one? Like, how much time does it take to nullify the charges, how long is one jailed for, what's the fine imposed etc.\r  \n\r  \nAlso! How many of these charges are actually proven false in the end?\r  \n\r  \nThanks for your time reading this post!\n\n(If anyone has come across this post twice, sorry for the repost!)",

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a 28-year-old man looking for advice on a tough situation in my marriage. Here's what's going on:\n\n- I’ve been married for 8 months, but before that, my wife and I were in a relationship for 4.5 years. After we got married, her behavior changed completely.\n\n\n- She often argues over small things, and sometimes she leaves to stay at her family’s house for days. She doesn’t help with any household chores, so my mom and I do everything. My mom even packs her tiffin for work.\n\n\n- We haven’t had any physical relationship, not before marriage and not after, which has been really hard for me.\n\n\n- Recently, I’ve fallen in love with a 21-year-old woman I’ve known for years. We’re now in a relationship, and we both care deeply for each other. We’re very compatible, even though there’s an age difference.\n\n\n- Because of these issues, I’m thinking about divorcing my wife. But I’m worried she might ask for maintenance or alimony, which I can’t afford to pay. She earns enough to support herself, but not a lot.\n\n\nMy Questions:\n\n\n1. What steps should I take before starting the conversation about divorce with her?\n\n2. How can I protect myself financially if she asks for alimony or maintenance?\n\n3. Or should I stay in this marriage and try to work it out?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

Understanding the reasons behind it can help us find solutions.\n\nMany people don't know what counts as domestic violence. They might think it only includes physical harm, but emotional, sexual, and economic abuse are also forms of violence. Educating people about these forms can help them recognize and stop abuse. Many women depend financially on their husbands or family members. This makes it hard for them to leave an abusive situation. However, it's important to note that men can also be victims of domestic violence, facing abuse from their partners or family members.\n\nVictims of domestic violence often feel scared or ashamed to speak out. They might fear retaliation from the abuser or judgement from society. Creating a supportive environment where victims feel safe to share their experiences is important. There are laws against domestic violence, but they are not always enforced strictly. Victims may face obstacles when trying to get legal protection. Domestic violence continues because of cultural norms, a lack of awareness, economic dependence, fear, inadequate laws, social stigma, substance abuse, and a lack of support services.",

Then the Senior made some call and we came to know that The Girl has complained that ‘I HAVE MADE FALSE MARRIAGE PROMISE TO HER AND I HAVE MADE OUR INTIMATE PHOTOS VIRAL’ .\n \nMy lawyer was furious at me but I told her there is no such thing. I submitted the letter and got out of there, I was called the next morning at 11Am. Next day me and my mom visited the office where they again made me write an apology letter and sent me home. I was given a warning and they told me only reason we’re letting you go is bcoz the Officer who called yesterday is a highly decorated officer. They also told me they’ll be watching me .\n\nAfter this, My Friend and his Girlfriend came to meet us at our home. Luckily my mom was present, they shamelessly started arguing with me and they told me how things had got worse for them now but I think they have managed it. Obviously they have told another lie or story but her in-laws and father still don’t know the TRUTH. They have requested me that if I get a call from her in-laws or father then please don’t tell about our relationship and just say sorry I have made a mistake. I have recorded the conversation and will be meeting with my lawyer soon and discuss what are the possible legal actions here.\n\nMostly even we don’t want any legal trouble, Just live and let live.

They deliver you wrong items, sometimes items missing completely & at other times, they cheat you with providing misinformation on their website misleading consumers to buy those products but in reality they're fake items.\nI ordered a Phillips MG5930/65 trimmer from amazon.in on 2nd Oct, 2024 where it clearly mentions on their website '3 Year Warranty', but the product which was delivered to me on 3rd Oct, 2024 clearly states '2 year worldwide guarantee'. Got a different information from what was promised.\nContacted their so-called great customer service support agents on the app via phone calls & they were so unsupportive. At the same time, each of them were providing different contradicting information which was really annoying. Was also promised & assured yesterday that I'll get the replacement product which specifically mentions 3 years warranty & also a warranty card with invoice supporting the same. But it didn't happen today, wasted a total of 5 hours on calls with 8 different agents & the last one with whom I spoke today said they can only provide the refund & raise a complaint against the seller to rectify the information on their website. This isn't the resolution I'm looking for.\nMind you this trimmer ain't cheap compared to the other ones being sold on their website. Also, contacted Philips customer support & even they confirmed that it's only 2 years & amazon has mentioned it wrongly.\nSuch harassment calls for a compensation in the form of apology. Hence, filed a grievance at 'national consumer helpline' portal seeking resolution for this matter as amazon simply said they can't do anything except providing refund for the item.\nWhat about the countless hours I spent surfing through hundreds of items on amazon to finalize this particular one based on the warranty provided which turned out to be false one. Complete bogus. This isn't a trivial matter which they stated. What if someone purchases a laptop or an electric bike online with the premise of good warranty coverage of the aforementioned time but in reality it turns out to be something else altogether. This is completely misleading & totally cheating on consumers. Such unwarranted harassment.\nDo I need to do anything else to raise awareness on this matter. Please help me with this.

        "text": "I'm a 26-year-old man in a 5-year relationship with a 24-year-old woman. We are from different castes and religions, but both religions share many similarities. Here are the key points of the situation:\n\n- I have been following her religion for the past three years, and I plan to continue doing so for the rest of my life. It's very similar to my own, so learning and adapting was easy for me.\n\n- Her parents have known about our relationship from the beginning and are fully supportive of our marriage. However, her father wants a large wedding and expects us to live with my parents (sasural) afterward, which we don't want. (He don't want us to live apart from my parents). \n\n# My Family Situation:\n\n- My parents are very controlling and toxic. They prevent me from going anywhere, claiming they are worried about my safety. They often disrespect and mock me, and they are very self-centered. Despite my unhappiness, they insist I live with them, as they expect me to take care of them when they get older. I also have an elder brother.\n\n- I told my parents about my relationship three months ago, and girl's father spoke with my father about meeting up to discuss our marriage. I overheard the conversation, and my parents seem uninterested in meeting her family, offering excuses to delay everything. They know I'm following my girlfriend’s religion to some extent.\n\n- My parents are saying they'll meet her family in November, but I want to get married in December. From my perspective, three months should be enough time for them to meet her and her family. However, my parents are saying they need six months to a year to \"observe\" the situation, and they're making excuses like, \"You'll suffer a lot in the future with this girl.\" It feels they are delaying everything intentionally so our relationship will get break with time. \n\n# Further Complications:\n\n- My parents won’t allow us to follow her religion. Even if they initially agree, I know they'll pressure me daily to follow our family's religion, which I don’t want to deal with.\n\n- The biggest concern my parents have is that they think I'll leave home after a few months of marriage to live separately, they don't even let my brother get settled in other state where he works. He stay home 15 days and rest 15 days in other state. His wife stay home 15 days without her husband but my parents don't care. My parents just want their children in their home at any cost. \n\n- My brother once slapped his wife, and my father has had physical fights with my mother on two occasions.\n\n# What I Want:\n\n- Ideally, I would like to marry my girlfriend as per her father’s wishes for a big wedding. However, explaining my toxic family situation to him is very difficult. Even with a big wedding, we can’t live in my parents' home due to the toxicity.\n\n- Another option is to run away and get married without involving anyone else. Her mother knows everything and is supportive of us.\n\nGiven all of this, I’m unsure how to proceed and what are legalities involved because my parents will try their best to drag me home even if I runaway with her after marriage. If you have some doubts I'll clear. Please help.\n\nEdits - Removed pedophile part. Also, me and my gf doing business together. We are earning well. (Adding this point). I don't want to leave the city I'm in so one thing I can do living in same city but lie that I left city and living in Bangalore now. So they won't trouble me. ",

        "text": "TLDR: A friend of my girlfriend secretly snooped through phone and took her private photos and kept it in pendrive.\n\nSo a few days ago I came to knowledge about a pendrive that was found in my hostel. Apparently it had folders of name of girls from our college and one of them was my girlfriend's folder. There stuff from varying degree. At first when my girlfriend heard the news she became suicidal at the thought and wanted to kill herself. There was this idea that someone hacked into her Snapchat or something. When she checked the pendrive herself, it wasn't bad to the level she thought were much more revealing pictures in her hide my eyes. The guy was only able to access the photos that were in the 'memories'. There far more worse pictures of other girls. Tbh this guy was close friends to some level to all of them and maybe at some point had passwords to phones. He seemed like a pretty fine guy so they didn't mind much. I do agree that it maybe the girls faults to why let anyone take there phones and could've more careful about there private being in easily accessible places. That 'guy' had been repeatedly doing this for like an year so....I did notice when how casually he would use my girl's phone, but I was fine friends only. Later when I checked her phone and realised what photos she didn't set private. I did tell and deleted a few of 'em. I wanted to tell what this friend of yours saw something, i just didn't wanna make her paranoid. And was like maybe unintentionally he might have seen and decided not to make a big deal about it, I wanted to be the secure boyfriend, curse me for being open minded.\nCurrently we are in possession of that pendrive and the 'guy' who has it , he is aware that he has lost something.\nI wanna take strict legal action, there is a high probability that the pendrive is the only source he had and no backups , but still can't be sure. Also we can't be sure if he's the only one who has seen. Can you check if the pendrive has been used on someone else's devices?\nAlso what other precautions and steps should I take regarding matter. I would welcome all and any kind of suggestions on how to ruin someone's life.",

There is no legal or social consensus. What if the woman hid that this high caste man was the father? She could easily get the lower caste status for the offspring.\n\nP.S. I am not looking for debate about reservation system. Even endless debates can't bring any change in it. It is permanent for the forseeable future. So why waste time arguing about it?\n\nI also posted in another subbreddit but posted it here because it comes under legal advice (To officially marry or live in a live in relationship)",

        "text": "I was returning from a tourist place (in my tata tiago) in Maharashtra and my wife was on front passenger seat holding my 1 year old son on the lap. She wasn’t wearing seat belt because the belt was bothering my son. There were few traffic cops on the road and one cop indicated me to pull over.\n1. He mentioned that my wife is not wearing sear belt and its a violation of traffic rules (i agree to this)\n2. He mentioned that my son should not be seated on front passenger seat because it makes it dangerous driving scenario (please confirm if it is true or he simply bluffed me)\n3. He mentioned that he will make a challan of 2k and then anyone in maharashtra will not stop me anymore, he sounded like a salesman here, later he mentioned that he will make it 1500.\n4. I requested him to give me the challan then he mentioned that i will get it over sms later, i said i can wait, then he asked my phone number and i received one message of e challan, it also had one link to pay challan online, traffic cops insisted that i should pay by cash and payment for this challan is settled. He didn’t let me open the link in message. I paid 1000rs cash to him, he didn’t give any receipt and told me that challan is settled.\nWhen i reached home and checked the link, i found that challan is active and unpaid. \n5. My car has dash-cam and it records audio but unfortunately the 12v plug had got unplugged during this ordeal, when i pushed the plug to start the cam, traffic cop mentioned that i have been cooperative and he will let go of second violation and i can leave.\n\nTLDR:\nSo basically he issued an e challan, i didn’t know that i have to pay online, he took 1k from me, lied to me that challan is settled but he kept those 1k for himself, and i have to make online payment for the challan\n\nI have few questions.\n1. Is there any rule as such that a kid / toddler cannot sit on front passenger seat, does it make a dangerous driving situation?? What should we do if traffic police bluff by stating such things?\n2. How many types of challans are there (RTO, traffic) are there any types as such ?? If so how can we make sure that payment is done successfully without letting these scammers put this money in their pocket??\n",

        "text": "Hello, I recently lost 62 lakhs to a task fraud on telegram and WhatsApp. It started when a person reached on WhatsApp for Google reviews and paid around 50 per review. Later this was moved onto telegram where they added me to a group of three and told there will be three tasks further which had to be done without break and at the end total amount can be withdrawn. Task began with investing 38k and second was to invest 4 lakh. Later he said I brought a wrong share and didn’t follow his instructions so all of us have to pay more to cover it so we did. The last task was 8 lakh. After this one member could withdraw amount, posted screenshot and left. For me and one more guy, he said our accounts are not vip level and should be to withdraw amount and demanded more 8 lakhs after which the other guy could withdraw and he left. But he said I gave an error bank account number and my account is freezed for which I was asked to pay. Seeing other two people getting their amount I trusted and paid. He again said account if unfreezed but funds are lying freely so a vip account has to be made to claim these are yours to which I said we already did so many transactions so it should be a proof so he said it’s the banks rule and promised this is last. This was charged a hefty amount too after which again he says tax has to be paid. I created an issue as he keeps breaking promises all the time and I can’t trust anymore and asked him to return all raw amount without profit and he doesn’t agree and demands more to get back all money. He gives an agreement from some company called HCL software and bitcoin exchange saying this is last but it was a forged document. I have filed complaint with cyber police last Monday. The so called trading was being done on a fake website called nvidia. If anyone has been through this and got back your money by battling, please suggest a way out for me to recover as much as possible as I had taken multiple loans to pay the scam and the emis now are way more than my salary. The police is being very slow and there’s no help I get from them. Thanks in advance! \n\n\nEdit: 1. I had reached out to police immediately and they took the complaint but took the FIR a month later. So I had been struggling to fill in EMIs and for my own daily basic needs too. Political power also did not help as elections are on and no one is in power. Last Tuesday an officer called up to let me know they’re investigating and took some details about this. \n\n2. I did not have all the money. As said once I wiped my money and savings, I trusted them due to screenshots and to get back my money, took loans and paid them off in huge amounts thinking I’d get back all my money and can close all the loans. However, I realise this mistake put me into my grave. 😔\n\nAlso please believe that I’m not faking, I can provide all the proofs if any are needed on my personal chat. Thanks, it’s just that I’m desperately looking for help and my friends suggested me to post here on reddit. And I joined here just for this so I do not have any previous posts.\n\nFIR - https://docs.google.com/document/d/104DCnN3pawAifi2xgvwoK0XhpSZ4ayoQyBY48vWvG3g/edit",

        "text": "Yeah you read it right and I am very guilty about it. She’s my bua. My father’s literally first cousin. \nI am not Indian. I was born and raised in Canada. 2015 was the first time I came to India and Saw her for the first time. She was always complimenting me about my looks and also took me out for lunch twice back then. All was good and I developed a good bond with her. \nIn 2017 I came to India again. Her actions were really changed towards me. She was touching me in a way and understood her intentions. I was naive only 19. She called to stay at her for a night and I agreed even knowing the intentions. Things happened that Night and I still got the recordings. I was here in India for two months and we did it pretty much all the time. When I moved to Canada. I felt very guilty of the acts I have done. \nFast forward to 2020. I came to visit India and got stuck here because of Covid. I stopped talking to her in 2020 and even she was okay with it as I explained what I felt. \nFrom 2020, I am living in India as I loved the country so much this time because I got time to explore everything. \nComing to my Bua, she is unmarried and have had many boyfriends. She left India in 2021 because apparently she found her love of the life, the guy was French and she moved to Denmark with her. I wished her well, she requested for one last time to do it( I am explaining this because I have got call recordings of her telling me this). I agreed. I felt relieved knowing she is now gone and this chapter is closed. \nLast month in April she came back to India because that guy left her. She didn’t marry him btw. During this period when she was not in India, I went back to Canada for a month to help my dad with some business related issues. I started dating this girl who is madly in love with me and she left everything to come with me to India. She has no connections in India apart from me. She’s a white girl. \nThis Bua is now single and want to do stuff with me again which I politely disagreed to. Two days back, she called me saying she wants to marry me and settle with me in Canada. If I disagree she will file rape case against me, even though I have proofs of what happened. She even told me that she will take the matter to my father and whole family. Yesterday at night, she sent our recordings to my girlfriend(who lives with me in India) and destroyed our relationship. She now wanna go back to Canada and doesn’t want me. \nWhat are the remedies I have for this situation. Please help me.\nI don’t want to leave this country. \nI even asked her to settle the matter with money which she disagreed. My only option is to leave India and never come back.\nShe is 48 and I am 24.",

Some of her words and actions have caused so much stress that it affected my mental health so I have slowed communication - and she is aware of this.\n\nShe is now pressuring for details of a spouse visa and that's causing some serious red flags. Is that the only reason she got married and any serious questions I asked about planning for the future were answered with lies? Now every time we talk, it causes more confusion than creates clarity. She seems oblivious to the fact that communication is down to once a week and is just constantly bombarding with emotional messages.\n\nI don't think I can afford to give her the benefit of doubt and sponsor her because of these red flags. I don't believe we have a matrimonial home in the legal sense as I am abroad and she is in India with her mum and siblings.

        "text": "This post is based on my understanding of the **Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill, 2024**. If there are any mistakes or inaccuracies, please let me know in the comments! I'm happy to learn and discuss. 😊\n\n# Uttarakhand Implements Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in 2024\n\nThe Uttarakhand government has introduced the **Uniform Civil Code (UCC)**, making it the first Indian state to adopt a unified legal framework for all its residents. This law simplifies and regulates matters like **marriage, divorce, inheritance**, and **live-in relationships**, ensuring everyone is treated equally under the same set of laws, regardless of their religion or cultural practices.\n\n# Key Points of the UCC\n\n1. **Marriage Rules:**\n   * Both partners must be **unmarried** at the time of marriage.\n   * Minimum age for marriage: **21 years for men, 18 years for women.**\n   * Marriage between close relatives (prohibited relationships) is not allowed unless permitted by specific customs, and those customs must not go against public policy.\n2. **Polygamy Banned:**\n   * Polygamy is **prohibited for everyone**, including communities where it was previously allowed (e.g., Muslim personal laws).\n   * Only **monogamous marriages** will be legally valid under the UCC.\n3. **Mandatory Marriage Registration:**\n   * Every marriage, even if solemnized outside Uttarakhand, must be registered with the authorities if at least one partner is a resident of the state.\n   * Marriages conducted since **2010** must also be registered retroactively.\n4. **Live-in Relationships:**\n   * Couples in live-in relationships must register their partnership within **30 days** of living together.\n   * **Children born from live-in relationships are considered legitimate** and will have inheritance rights.\n   * Women deserted by live-in partners can claim **financial support (maintenance)** through the courts.\n5. **Equal Inheritance Rights:**\n   * Both sons and daughters are given **equal inheritance rights** to their parents’ property, ensuring gender equality.\n6. **Religious Freedom for Ceremonies:**\n   * Couples can marry following their own religious or customary traditions, such as **Saptapadi, Nikah, Holy Union**, or **Anand Karaj.**\n\n# Who Does It Apply To?\n\n* The UCC applies to **all residents of Uttarakhand**, even those living outside the state.\n* **Scheduled Tribes** and groups with **protected customary practices** under the Constitution are exempt from this Code.\n\n# What Changes Under the UCC?\n\nThe UCC replaces personal laws based on religion with a **common set of rules** for everyone. For example:\n\n* Practices like **polygamy** are no longer allowed.\n* There is now a standardized procedure for marriage, divorce, and property inheritance.\n* Women in both marriages and live-in relationships have clear legal protections.\n\nFINE AND IMPRISONMENT \n\n* Under the Uttarakhand UCC, 2024, failing to submit a live-in relationship statement can result in:\n\nFine: Up to ₹10,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 3 months.\n\nProviding false information or ignoring notices can lead to stricter penalties, including:\n\nFine: Up to ₹25,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 6 months.",

So yesterday i had Sahodaya examination and i forgot to keep my phone on the teachers table , during the last 15 Minutes of the exam I was just laying down then this Invigilation teacher was walking around the room and saw me with my phone hanging out of my pocket. Now , i was not aware that i had my phone with me as i thought that i had already submitted my phone on the table. The Invigilation teacher confiscated my phone and she is also the Senior coordinator so she asked me to collect my phone from the head mistress after the exam was over. I went over to the staff room to collect my phone, the Head Mistress was absent and i was told to go back home and that i would not be receiving my phone the same day. They also told me that they were going to call my parents and unless they do that I was not going to get my phone back. So i did not get my phone yesterday and they treated me like a piece of shit for having my phone in my pocket. They thought i was copying with it and told me that i cannot be trusted, each classroom has 1 CCTV Camera which I am not aware is they work or not but I swear i didn't know that my phone was still in my pocket. Now that was yesterday and after my mom got back home from work they asked her to meet them today to collect my previous exam answer sheets and get my phone back. They informed her today that the sheets will be sent home by students and i would get my phone the end of this month. I am pissed and angry at the teachers because the only way i communicate with my parents is with my phone and i have no other means to do so , I also commute to school by metro everyday and from the station i sometimes take an auto home. I read that its not legal for school to hold a student's phone with them for more than a day ; they either have to return the phone during the working hours of the school or had it over to parents the same day if the student is a minor. Now I searched the web seeking help from people who have went through the same situation; write an apology letter and apologize to the teacher or file a case on the school with the help of the police is what is found. Would appreciate some advice on what is to be done. FYI I did not keep that phone with me to copy or anything i completely forgot that it was even in my pocket man and knowing there is a CCTV camera recording i would not copy!",

Recently a week ago, a girl probably a couple of years elder to me cam for walking in the same stadium. All the people who run/walk do it in the same direction. But she alone walks in the opposite direction and it is super annoying to me. The track is not wide. Most of the track is filled with grass apart from a small patch which is not covered with grass because of people running over that same path. So basically only one can go. As I am working on myself to achieve running milestones, I run a bit faster. Whenever she comes in front of me, she doesnt move an inch so I move just enough to avoid a crash. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA couple fo days ago, we had an argument. She said I am the only one who doesnt leave her space and stuff. I asked her why she's the only one to walk in opposite direction and she argued there is no such rule to walk in a praticular direction. I didnt talk much, ignored an continued my running as the stopwatch was running. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNothing much has happened since. I keep running the same way but she gets annoyed everytime I pass her. I guess we are somewhere close to having another verbal arguement soon. Given the provisions for women, she might file a harassment case against me. I am ready to battle it out legally for all the men around. We have never ever crashed into each other only because I take precaution to avoid her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould I call 100 and explain my story of a potential case against me or write an email to the police just incase things go down? I dont know much legal stuff but if you guys think I can win a case, I am ready to fight it out legally no matter how many years/money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso this is a very very petty thing but I just wanted to know your thoughts.

Since both of us are atheists, we didn't want a Hindu wedding either.  \nSo last week when I started looking for a way to arrange things for our wedding, I got to know there's no way for a Hindu couple to get our marriage registered if we don't get married according to the customs. Interreligious couples can marry at the registrar of marriages office but not Hindu couples. There's no form available in the website to apply for one.  \nI guess we should have at least an option for a religious-free wedding. If there's any, help your homeboy here! Thanks.",

Had to call customer service like 5-6 times regarding this and they asked me to place an order again whatever the differential amount be , would be given in Amazon pay balance.  So I placed the order again and it costed me 5,399 rs extra than the sale price . I placed this order on 9th October, 2024 and it was supposed to arrive on 13th but again no signs of delivery. I've been calling these guys almost 4 times since 14th , all they tell me is to wait till 10pm each day for the order. It's absolutely ridiculous and very frustrating.  They have also been telling me they are having a shortage of manpower due to the sale periods but it's honestly not my lookout as a customer.  I'm not responsible for their operations department.  Its been 4 days delay now ( 18/19 days in total) . I have to call customer service daily from my side, zero accountability from these guys . The audacity of these guys to even end the call abruptly without proper explanation is frustrating.  Anyone has solution for this issue ??",

        "text": "In the recent couple of months, I've noticed that Amazon India is harassing customers unnecessarily & indulging in fraud activities. They deliver you wrong items, sometimes items missing completely & at other times, they cheat you with providing misinformation on their website misleading consumers to buy those products but in reality they're fake items.\nI ordered a Phillips MG5930/65 trimmer from amazon.in on 2nd Oct, 2024 where it clearly mentions on their website '3 Year Warranty', but the product which was delivered to me on 3rd Oct, 2024 clearly states '2 year worldwide guarantee'. Got a different information from what was promised.\nContacted their so-called great customer service support agents on the app via phone calls & they were so unsupportive. At the same time, each of them were providing different contradicting information which was really annoying. Was also promised & assured yesterday that I'll get the replacement product which specifically mentions 3 years warranty & also a warranty card with invoice supporting the same. But it didn't happen today, wasted a total of 5 hours on calls with 8 different agents & the last one with whom I spoke today said they can only provide the refund & raise a complaint against the seller to rectify the information on their website. This isn't the resolution I'm looking for.\nMind you this trimmer ain't cheap compared to the other ones being sold on their website. Also, contacted Philips customer support & even they confirmed that it's only 2 years & amazon has mentioned it wrongly.\nSuch harassment calls for a compensation in the form of apology. Hence, filed a grievance at 'national consumer helpline' portal seeking resolution for this matter as amazon simply said they can't do anything except providing refund for the item.\nWhat about the countless hours I spent surfing through hundreds of items on amazon to finalize this particular one based on the warranty provided which turned out to be false one. Complete bogus. This isn't a trivial matter which they stated. What if someone purchases a laptop or an electric bike online with the premise of good warranty coverage of the aforementioned time but in reality it turns out to be something else altogether. This is completely misleading & totally cheating on consumers. Such unwarranted harassment.\nDo I need to do anything else to raise awareness on this matter. Please help me with this.

        "text": "A little background about myself(this would be relevant for later). I am an Engineering student from a TIER-1 engineering college(NON-IIT/BITS) in my 4th year. I belong to a rather poor family with no income source, an alcoholic abusive father, a very very burnt out mother and a bed ridden elder brother due to medical conditions.I have taken a good sum as education loan and chose this path for a better future for myself and mostly my family.\n\nI met my girlfriend in my 3rd semester. It was rather quick and we started dating. I didn't think much about it as it was a first timer for me and I was very naive so it happened quicker than I could imagine. Over the past 2 years things have got really bad. I discovered she was very suicidal and depressed a couple of months after we started dating. She is from a well off family but slightly conservative nuclear family with a few issues. She is extremely depressed(clinically I believe) and suicidal. My entirety of college life went in taking care of this, which made sure that my grades sink. I spent no time doing anything else and I have become mentally and physically exhausted. All of my time is spent in convincing her not to do the thing or helping her to not go deeper into it. I dedicated myself to this because I believed I could fix the issue. I tried to get her some professional help which didnt last long due to the appointments taking too long. I tried contacting her parents and while they took it seriously for a couple of days, they brushed it off later. They fail to understand the gravity of it.\n\nNow whenever I withdraw attention to focus on anything productive, she goes through even worse episodes and it taxes me emotionally more. A third of my entire college life was spent out at night, at 4 AM, trying to console her. This has become a burden as my familial and financial condition is horrible too and the idea of putting my college life to a waste and not getting a good job by the end of the year will really be horrible.\n\nMy girlfriend has suggested me to break up with her although I have stalled it because I am afraid that if I leave, she might do something very stupid. She has no social life or any friends. How can I get away with this situation? I want to leave as well and I am incredibly scared. \n\nI can not tell my parents about any of this for it will be a hell. Conveying this would not only take away the only hope that keeps my mother pushing but also invite a very ugly and irrational decision from my alcoholic father. I struggle for literal hundreds of rupees and so thats an angle to take care of as well.\n\nI am looking for legal advice and opinions.",

Here’s what happened:\n\nI booked a cab from Gurugram to New Delhi Railway Station. The driver  intentionally took a wrong turn to save toll of Rs.100  which was already included in the fare, causing me to miss my train. To make matters worse, I was charged an extra amount for the ride.\n\nWhen I contacted Rapido’s support, they acknowledged that the driver made a mistake and refunded the increased fare amount, but only as a credit to their in-app wallet—not back to my original payment method.\n\nHere’s what I’m seeking:\n\n1. A formal apology from Rapido for the inconvenience caused.\n2. A full refund of the fare back to my source account.\n\nI believe I have a valid case due to the negligence of the driver and the company’s handling of the situation. I’m considering legal action but wanted to get some insights from others who may have dealt with similar issues. What steps should I take next? Is it worth pursuing legal action, or should I explore other avenues first?\n\nAny advice or experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

Earlier it was reasonable I didn't mind it much. I can only imagine how it must be for the ones living closer. \n\nI want to take up a noise pollution problem and proceed with some legal documents to get them to at least lower it.  \n\n\nFor starters, I'm just looking for an official legal document that says \"this is violating noise levels, if this is not reduced, further action will be taken\" so that I can get the ball rolling. If it still doesn't work, I'm keen on filing and purpusing and following a long term action if need be.\n\nCan any lawyers suggest what is a feasible course of action given that I have no background or experience in court/legal matters? My legal budget is arnd Rs. 50K would be willing to spend more if situation demand it.",

        "text": "As the heading says, my cousin (19F) shouted me in front of my whole family this morning, me tumhe barbad kar dungi, jante nhi ho tum mujhe. These are her literal words . My mother is bit scared because of this . I don't know what to do, should I be worried about this?\n\nHere is the back story; So I will not say that we are pretty close, she is the chipku and nosy type, always stalking my private life. She knew about my relationship and mujhe bhi paata tha uske baare me . And she has sent me some of her intimate photos with her boyfriend(hugging, kissing on the cheek etc..)which I didnt ask her. But uske paas mera na koi photo tha na koi proof. Bus she had a name.  Now few months back, she got exposed, jab videocall pe baat kar rhi thi tab uski maami ne dekh liya or khub pitai ki uski. Then she used me as a shield, ki jab bhai aeysa kar rha hai to me kyu nhi kar sakta. Tab gharwale mere pe bhi gussa karne lage, ye to mera kismat achha tha ki mene apni girlfriend ko mere ghar pe introduce kar rakha tha (2 saal pehle ki baat hai ye jab mera breakup nhi hua tha and mere gharwale usse jaante the as a friend of mine). So itna kuch effect nhi pada mere family pe and ab jab breakup ho gya hai mera , mere gharwale jaante hai uske baare me . \n\nFirst forword today, all of my family members are having a small get together. So out of nowhere her topic came out and she started to use me as a shield . Bus wo bolti rhi ki jo bhaiya kar rhe hai wo galat nhi hai to me jab karu to galat kya hai etc etc.. and then I just told her, tu bahat bol rhi hai tab se, ab me bolu? All of a sudden she started crying jese ki mene usse pit diya ho. Fir rote rote bole lagi ki me tumhe barbad kar dungi, jante nhi ho mujhe. Ese bol ke fir rone lagi. Fir gharwalo ne saant kiya usse.. lekin meri mummy tab se dari hui hai, kahin kuch galt bol diya to fans jaunga me. And you know the justice system nowadays.\n\nSo I am asking what should I do now? Should I be worried? Actually wo thodi si muhfaad hai, so we doubt ki fir kabhi kisi aur ke saamne bol diya to dikkat ho jaegi .. what should I do now? I already blocked her from everything and I still have her photos with her boyfriend. Any precautions should I take ??\n\ntl;dr- my cousin (19f) shouted at me (23m) that I will destroy you in front of my whole family. My mom is worried since morning . What should I do now ? Should I be worried?",

        "text": "I'm from India,\nAs per the indian laws, its considered as rape, if a man tells a women he intends to marry her, just to have sex with the her. While having no intension to ever do so. \n\n\nMy flatmate is doing this to one of his girl friends. \n\nDespite me telling the women he isn't serious about you and he has no intention to marry you. And showing the girl proof of other girls he has slept with after promising her marriage.\n\nThat compulsive lair has convinced her still to stay with him.\n\nNow I don't know what they spoke, but in this situation I kinda feel like I'm the dumb person here to even try to help the girl see the truth.\n\n\nI have hence separated myself from this situation(after she again decided to believe him) .\n\nBut I feel like legally, what my country's law label as rape, Is happening to someone I know, and I cannot do anything. Not only do I have to live with the fact something very wrong was happening in front of me, and when I tried to help, It's almost like I have been made to look like the asshole here.\n\nIt makes me want to never interfere if any women is being abused ever. \n\nWhat should I do in this situation? \n\nP.S. Please note that I did not go to her saying  you need to listen to me or some shit like that. She came to me. She asked herself. And then after gathering proof of they guy cheating on her. Just went back to him",

        "title": "Filing DV Case Against My Ex-husband - Possibilities and Outcomes",
        "text": "I was first married back in April 2019. Nothing was normal with that guy. He was a PubG addict and would spend all night playing game on his mobile or watching movies on his mobile, and no sex or no interaction as well whatsoever. I even told him if he had any issues, we could consult a doctor but treating me like I don't exist wasn't okay. Days went on and things became worse as I was not even able to sleep peacefully due to the noise he made (talking with other players loudly) while playing PubG. I told him to at least give me the basic human need of sound sleep, however he became abusive verbally and also started body shaming me and harassing me. If I talked anything, he would start abusing me. I later found out he had unfinished past relationship where the girl refused to marry him but they were continuing communication even after he got married to me. Within a few days, as I started digging and finding out more truths about him, he started hitting me. The abuse turned more violent and physical. Then in June 2019, just two months after marriage, he hit me so bad that I was scared for my life. He kicked my head, my eyes, slapped me and kept hitting me until his mom came and asked him why he was hitting me. His mom never asked him to stop, she only asked him why. In this moment of his distraction, I ran, locked myself in the bathroom and called my parents, fearing for my life and left that house that very day. He was so tall and broad and strong that I couldn't even have any kind of self defence for myself that day. \n\nI then applied for divorce and the unregistered two months marriage took 2.5 years to get dissolved legally, despite us not living together or having contact after those two months. \n\nI wanted to get out of that abusive and draining marriage legally and as soon as possible and hence I did not press any DV charges (also because I was terrified and scared of him). I also did not ask any alimony or maintainance as I wanted out of it without dragging the case for years. Without asking anything itself, the case took 2.5 years to complete. \n\nThree years after the divorce, I got married to another man and we're happy. My now husband knows all about what I went through and is a good man who appreciates and cherishes my every bit of existence.\n\nNow the problem is that I always have felt I never got any kind of justice for what I went through because of him. He just like that came in an arranged marriage setup, married me, made my life hell, abused me verbally and physically, hit me to the point of me fearing for my life, but none of it never affected anything in him or his life. Me, on the other hand, am still suffering due to all the trauma he caused me. 5.5 years down the line since that deadly physical assault, I still have sleepless nights and am still facing trauma due to it. I want closure, I want him to pay for what he did. I don't want any money from him, but I want him to be legally held responsible for what he has caused me for the rest of my life. I don't have any proof of that assault as back then all people convinced me against going to police or filing a complaint on him. He will agree to the assault proudly if questioned by anyone any time. He's always been proud of all the assaults he did to me, because according to him, men are entitled to treat their wives however they want. I want closure and I want to get out of this trauma of not having a closure and him not being held responsible for what he has done. \n\nWhat are my options here and how can I go about it? Again, money isn't my motive here, I want him to be held responsible and have closure to the ever lingering feeling of the injustice caused to me.\n\nEdit: \nTo people asking why I married him - Lol! Looks like you don’t have much idea about the arranged marriage setup in India. It was one such arranged marriage, and there were a lot of lies from the groom’s side and his family. I didn't get to spend time with him or the family before marrying him. I started knowing things and uncovering their lies once I started living with him. Of course if I had known prior, I wouldn’t have got into it.\n\nTo people calling it a rage bait - This is my first post here. I infact had to google what a rage bait was. Whatever I wrote was just expressing what I know about my ex-husband and is NOT meant to trigger people around. In fact, it'd be good if the triggers don't comment here and create a whole bunch of useless stuff in comments to read. ",

        "text": "I recently got to know that My wife lied about her marital status in passport. \n\nMarital Background: \n\n-We changed her surname in Aadhar card from her parents’ to mine after marriage.\n\n-Things in marriage got complicated\n\n-She filed false false 498a and dv against me and my family.\n\n-she decided to move to USA for studies (as every woman who cannot show their face in society after filing false cases).\n\n-Applied for passport at this point as she did not have passport. At this point, her Aadhar still has my surname.\n\n-She takes IELTS, applies to colleges, gets into one etc\n\n-Applied for visa\n\n-we filed for mutual divorce with the understanding that she will withdraw the case. It is mentioned in mutual divorce affidavit that she should withdraw the case.\n\n-she still hasn’t withdrawn the cases\n\n-She flies off to USA in august 2023\n\n-Now i get to know in feb 2024 that she is not able to go embassy to give statement via Video conferencing. Upon drilling down, i got a hint that she has lied in her passport application that she is unmarried. This made me wonder, if she could go to that extent, her disdain for me could not allow her to take my surname in her passport. She could have somehow manipulated Aadhar as well.\n\nAlso, her family has a criminal and political background.\n\n\n**My question is, can she go back to passport office and tell the officials that it was a mistake? Or will it considered a crime  no matter what. **\n\n\nEdit: i dont think people are understanding the point here. For me to give her divorce, she has to withdraw cases, obviously. For that to happen, she has to go to embassy for video conference, which she can’t do because when she claimed she is unmarried how come she has filed 498a (the embassy will ask). I think i might have touched some feminists’ ultra sensitive parts here. But i haven’t filed a single false case against this woman, yet. Only she has. \n\nEdit 2: people are also missing the point that how could she have changed the surname in aadhar card before divorce? If she has given duplicate or older aadhar card, that is a bigger crime isn’t it?\n\n#passportlaw #indianpassport #passportfraud",

        "title": "Fake allegations by maid",
        "text": "I Originally posted on r/IndianLaw. \n\nThis could be long but please read it.\n\nGuys I need help on next step. So Today my maid(f40+) called my brother saying that my father(71, teacher for over 50years) grabbed her hand when she was moping upstairs. He immediately asked for Proof to which she said she don't have my but she'll provide next time. And this app happened on 9th June.\n\nBut in reality she never moped upstairs however she went up to take a shit. When my father was busy laying clothes. She came out of the toilet and he asked her why she said shes going to mop when she is doing potty.\n\nA little bit of the background: we have know her and her mother for over 26 years. She has. son who's been to jail for a few month last year. and. daughter. my father has always treated her like a daughter. When he got severe COVID and his legs stopped working her mother used to help in excercising his legs. He is dependent on insulin for life. He other lower abdomen problems as well. I mean he's 70. However he still teaches students which includes girls as well.\n\nAnyways,Now what we've decided is not to do\nanything as there literally no truth to her story. And we'll let her go in 2 months since she comes late at work all the time. But I want to know if this is the right thing to do. What if she put on some fake injuries or something. But also she's been working since 9. And no CCTV footage is not available for Upstairs.Just the Gate maybe.\n\n\nEdit/Update: so as decided not to react we didnt when this evening after all the allegations it was just my mother and i alone at home when she came late again and drank her evening tea which we offer daily. She didn't say a word but talked about why she was late and how she found out that her bank branch shifted. shes only contacted my brother who she knows work. she doesn't know i work too. Its beyond my mental capacity why she confided in him of all the people. He doesn't even talk to her like at all.\n\nbut we are firing her this month and we have multiple reason that have been lingering for months now. she is extra late nowadays probably some new work. her work takes not more than 15 minutes to complete and in the evening it's even less. Besides her taking time to shit. \n\nand as to her evidence she said she'll call my brother to show her audio. but there will be no next time. We stopped allowing her to use the restroom upstairs coz it's reserved for the tenant. but that alleged day she insisted on going upstairs. a separate toilet is available for the outsiders downstairs too. but she didn't use it. i don't know why. that day our tenant wasn't there.\n\n\nanyways as for the cameras everyone is saying. i don't think it'll be of help. because to install a camera in a room just doesn't seem right. and we are never allowing her upstairs ever again. even if she goes upstair no way my father is going too for sure.\n\nUpdate 2: so she did her work and all never talked to me or anyone except once specified time to my brother. Yesterday her son got arrested and his friends were arrested a day before. Today she came on time because my mother has been telling her to do so. She even asked me to dial up her lawyers she illiterate and she's also a widow with 2 kids which includes a minor girl. All this makes this story sad and it is. Also she is completely blind in one eye. \n\nHowever, Today after she went away i installed true caller in my brother's phone. i know this sounds lame. Anyways he had earlier blocked her number on the 13th when she called first. Yesterday 14th june around 3 pm her son went to jail. Day before yesterday i.e. 13th her son's jail bird friends were taken in custody. Now having installed true caller i found out she has missed called him 3 times around 4-4:30pm, 1 call came from a lawyer too. i don't know if that was her lawyer or not. Today in the morning when she came to work she didn't ask my brother about why he didn't pick up. I made him and my father sit with me. If she really wanted justice she could've called him out right then. Further, she asked me to call up her lawyer. So according to me she knew about her son getting caught so she thought of blaming an old man who can't even walk properly, been on ducasteride for years his testosterone levels are low af, alive because of insulin, partially blind in one eye all this just so she could extract money from us. \nAnd no she never talked to my mother and i or even our extended family where she works. She specifically told my brother not to tell my mother. Because it was all a lie. it was never about my father or the accusations she made on him. it was probably just the money. Damn.\n\nPS: this is my last post from this account",

Maybe he didn’t escalate the situation because he lacks evidence ?????\nNote- when he first confronted us,he told me he saw us kissing and my gf giving me a bj but I’m sure that as he is looking from behind our car its not fully visible with all the back side seat being at a heightened level then the front seat and with all the head rest and when he reached the front seat we looked as if we did nothing.Before leaving he tell us both me and gf to call him after reaching home to know that we are safe and to drive home safely.From my gut feeling he seems a genuinely good guy.During the confrontation,he take me to a temple nearby to promise on the god of the temple that I marry my gf(of 3 years) or else let the god take my life away.\nThen he called us at night,the 3 of us talk for 10-20 mins,he is explaining how such horrible things happen at that place(it was our very first time at that place,we thought that there are no people nearby, we don’t know such things happen).He said their community member scold him as to why he didn’t bring us to their community hall and give some pusihments to us.He told us he lied to them and even deleted our numbers in case they look into his phone.\n\nMy question- what can I do if he uploads the videos on the internet like Facebook ?(He told us that he didn’t take any video, I’m sure he did take some video even if it is not a clear visual one.)If the video is on Internet then our lives will be ruined,we won’t be able to live anymore,we will lose all respect.My gf said she won’t live anymore.My conscience says that even if he has the video,it will be all from behind our car in which we can’t be seenproperly.but our initial confrontations will be all seen in that video,of us begging him ewe are sorry.\nPlease give some advice.\n",

So she asked me to make a paypal account, so that they will use my paypal as their payment option, and then I will transfer the money to them and keep my cut.\n\nThis work has lucrative money. And I am not exactly rich, or even middle class.  \n**But I am fully aware of the dangers this idea might have.**\n\nI don't have anyone whom I can ask for advice regarding this matter. So I am here to ask the feasibility of this idea from people who have the know-how of the law and the taxation codes.\n\nI know this sounds like money-laundering plain and simple, but just for a moment imagine it isn't, and the sales are not of illicit stuff (which I hope and trust they aren't). Is there a way to make this work while remaining within the laws and rules?  \nWould just paying taxes on time work, or would we need to make a company or something?  \n**Again I don't intend to break the law** but at the same time I want to work with them in a legally sound way.\n\nI believe the pain points would be the reason for wire transfer, and what is the product we(or I) are selling.",

However, I'm worried about the legal side of things now that I've made a partial payment.\n\nHere are the key details:\n\nPartial Payment: I've already sent 25% of the total payment to the developer in Pakistan for their work on my app.\n\nTransaction Amount: The total transaction amount is approximately $2000 USD.\n\nFinding the Developer: I found this developer on Fiverr, and we agreed to work outside of the platform to avoid the platform fees, which is why I'm making the transaction directly through wire.\n\nNow, my specific concern:\n\nTransaction Tracing: Given the current geopolitical tensions, I'm concerned about the possibility of these transactions being traced and the implications this might have for me. Are there any risks I should be aware of in this regard?\n\nWhile the amount isn't massive, I'm still wondering if it's worth worrying about in terms of potential legal or tracing issues.\n\nI would be really grateful if you can help clearing out my dilemma .",

Recently, I was the victim of task fraud and my bank account got frozen. It was a stressful experience, but luckily, I was able to get things sorted out with the help of an expert. He explained the situation to me clearly and helped me take the necessary steps to get my account unfrozen.\n\nThis incident started when I received a message on WhatsApp saying that they will send me money for posting reviews on Google Maps. Out of curiosity, I posted the review and they sent me the money. I felt something was off and said that I was not interested and blocked that person. However, the damage was already done and that transaction was flagged by Gujrat Cyber Crime cell and my account was Frozen.\n\nMy account was frozen on 1st March and due to it my savings was stuck in the account and with no way of retrieving my funds, I was in distress. I tried to contact my bank but they just told me that it was blocked by the Gujrat Cyber-Crime cell and that there wasn't anything they could do. I tried to contact the Cyber Crime cell but they didn't respond to my calls or emails. \n\nUltimately, I found Mr. Jeeth on reddit and I and contacted him about my issue. I provided him with my account details and he was able to pull the details of my case. After getting the details, we coordinated and he explained the situation to me in detail. He also told me how I needed to proceed in order to get my account unfreeze. I shared all the relevant documents with him for the verification process and my account was unfreeze after a week's time.\n\n**Important:** I am only able to share this information after getting explicit permission from Mr Jeeth (rule-9). Also if anyone wants to contact him, you can do so at u/Bankfreezeexpert . Again, This is just genuine advise that you should seek the help of professionals and I am not promoting or advertising anybody (rule-8).",

        "text": "I’m looking for legal advice about my main Reddit account, u/DishantChandra, being banned after being accused of breaking Rule 3. The message from the reddit admin said: *\"After reviewing, we found that you broke Rule 3 because you shared intimate media of someone without their consent.\"* This is a total lie – I never shared any intimate media, links, or images.\n\nHere’s the situation:  \nI made a post on r/Tantra to raise concerns about the subreddit’s moderators being involved with NSFW subreddits while running a faith-based subreddit. All I did was post a title with my concerns – no images, links, or media, and no description box used. In fact, the subreddit's automod removed my post with the message: *\"Your post has been removed because there is little or no content in the text body.\"* This shows I didn’t post any media or intimate content.\n\nDespite this, I was still banned under Rule 3. I appealed, but the ban was upheld, and Reddit hasn’t responded to my emails or given any other explanation. It feels like they’re just backing up a false claim with no evidence.\n\nI get that the issue of moderators running NSFW subreddits while managing a faith-based one is a grey area, and I’m not saying it’s right or wrong. But what doesn’t make sense is why the mods of r/Tantra were so hurt by my post, and why Reddit admins are supporting their false accusations without evidence. It’s obvious I don’t fit their narrative, and they’re just silencing me.\n\nThis looks like part of a larger pattern of bias and censorship against Hindus. I’m being punished for expressing a valid concern, and there’s no real reason for it other than to shut me down.\n\nIf I don’t get this resolved, I’m planning to take legal action, starting with consumer court and moving on to the high court if necessary.\n\nHere’s the [link to the removed post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tantra/comments/1i3mjfp/removed_by_reddit/)\n\nAny advice on how to take this further or escalate it?

I was almost about to consume it but the topping did not look familiar so it struck me that the pizza could be non-veg.

They said that they won't be able to remove the pizza but offered me the entire order amount as gift voucher (Rs 400 approx). I told them that the pizza should also be removed as a basic courtesy to which they declined.\n\nNow the matter is that we hear so many stories of such things happening in various other countries and the handsome compensation that is paid to the complainants in those cases.

        "title": "My wife went to India with my child from Canada in the name of vacation and when I asked for divorce due to our differences she is refusing to come back and I'm losing access to my child",
        "text": "I'm the father 35M wife is 34F both of us Indian citizens and married in India and are permanent residents in Canada and our daughter is 1.5yeara old is a Canadian citizen. Let me give you some context. I'm asking for a divorce because our relationship has deteriorated to the extent where we are not fighting only if we are not in the same room. I believe it's better for our daughter to grow up in a co-parenting relationship so that she won't grow up seeing her parents arguing all the time if we had stayed in the marriage just for her. Since I'm now asking for divorce, she doesn't want to come back to Canada saying she was here in Canada only for me. Moving to Canada was a long time dream for me and the primary reason was so that my children can have a better future with opportunities and freedom that I never had growing up. Me and my daughter have a very good relationship to the extent that she prefers me to be around than be with anybody else. She is the typical textbook example of daddy's girl but she is too young and still needs her mother. I was taking care of her mostly in the first 6 months and after that our parents came in to help. After she was a year old and when my wife started to work, I gave up my work from home job to train for a job that would increase my income potential and provide more for the family. She is calling my increased absence in home as me not having any love for our daughter and calls me a bad father. Mind you whenever I was with her I was there more than a 100%. \n\nI want to have 50% custody of my daughter but my wife is refusing to come back to Canada stating that she doesn't like Canada for the cold and she works from home and doesn't have friends here for a social circle if I'm not going to be with her. I think it's unfair that my daughter has to grow up without her father being involved just because of her mother's lack of friends here and the winter and make Canada sound like a country that refugees run away from. \n\nI want her to come here with my daughter. She can take the house that we bought for her to grow up in and I will pay for any child support payments. I love my daughter and just want to have her in my life at least 50% or more. \n\nShe has always earned more than me. She makes close to 140-150k a year or more these days and I make about 60-70k a year. Now since she moved to India and she refuses to come back to Canada, the company that she works for told her they can only pay her in Indian pay standards going forward which will of course be lesser than what she is earning here in Canada which would be an equivalent of at least 30k-40k CAD which is a very good salary to live in India (context: will easily be in top 10% of earners in India). She is also fully financially taking care of her mother who does not work and is kind of separated and her sister who is divorced and doesn't want to go to work and support herself. Now she is asking me to pay a fixed amount as child support in India by Ontario's standards. Even if I pay $500 which is affordable to me and to give you context that is good enough to rent a very good 2-3 bedroom condo in a big city in India, I'm definitely concerned the money won't fully be utilised for my child. I'm not trying to wiggle out of any child support payments and I know courts always side with the women and as a man I will most likely be in the losing end but I'm also asking help from the legal community here, is there anyway I get to be with my daughter in Canada irrespective of how much ever I have to pay in any support payments in Canada. If not and I have to pay her child support to live in India, will the Canadian courts see the purchase power parity in India and Canada and adjust the child support accordingly? I much rather split the child's actual expenses in India (which is what she states in another post in this group as me trying to avoid paying child support and me trying to control her expenses) and pay her that and invest the rest in Canada to give it to her when she turns 18. \n\nI also want to note that I respect my wife as the mother of my child and I want her to be involved in her life growing up and will never fight for full custody, I'm just asking that I also have the chance to be involved in her life growing up that does not need me to move back to India.",

The hotel had 2 incharge/owner (who were not present there) and a receptionist. The receptionist asked us for 1k but we already had spoke to the owner or incharge for 900 and this is important as when we called the incharge and he told her to charge 900 from us as we are regulars ( this infuriated the receptionist for some reason maybe the incharge was her brother in law or for whatever reason) \n\nShe gave us a room which was a bit small and we asked her to shift us to some other room and she complied. After this, everything went downhill.. the room in which we shifted was a total mess - the flush wasn't working, the tv/remote wasn't working, we complained about it and we asked for a soap to wash hands before eating and they were negligible about it for sometime and after asking for 2-3 times they gave us a small soap stating \" mam ne apni purse se nikal ke diya hai! \" \n\nWe were annoyed and called the incharge again told him to resolve the tv/remote and flush issue. He did tell us to take refund and shift to some other branch of that hotel but we refused as we were there for more 4-5 hours only and our time was already wasted. That's when the receptionist came and started shouting at my partner at the top of her voice screaming why have we called the incharge but it has been 2 hours and they were completely negligible about our issues. The other incharge came and fixed our flush and promised us the tv/remove will start working as soon as possible and he left. The receptionist and the workers made no proper efforts to fix the tv/remove and we let it go. Afterwards, when we were eating the paneer, the gravy was spilled (oil stains) and ruined the bedsheet which was completely our fault.  \n\nThe receptionist was a bit mad at us for calling the in charge and she switched off the mcb or whatever of our room. We stayed there or an hour or two without electricity afterwards we noticed the light was in other rooms and hallway but not in our room which made us a bit mad and my partner again complained about it to her and she was makin excuses and screamin at us that's it not her fault you were ones who asked for another room until this point my partner was the one doing all the talking and she was very disrespectful to him which made me a bit irritated and i retaliated and had a fight with her (i was also a bit disrespectful to her ngl) and thereafter she got furious and screamed go and call the incharge again. My partner did call the owner again and he told her to shift us to another room. \n\nWe shifted and again AC was not working and she switched off the WiFi so we weren't able to watch TV. We ignored and then she called my partner to the previous room where we stayed and asked him to pay 1k for the oil-stained bedsheet, he refuted and went from there. She called the incharge (the one who fixed our flush and maybe his husband/boyfriend) and spoke to him about the stained bedsheet. He called my partner and threatened him to pay 1k or else he'll go to his and my house with police and get the amount (he already had our aadhars so..) My partner did ask them to let him pay for the laundry bill as the oil stains are removable but they threatened to \"pay or else\" . We live with our parents and my boyfriend was a bit scared. Thus, he paid 1k for it.\n\nAny legal advice?",

INR which makes it 850k+ USD. We have some property in rural area and some in urban. \n\nThough, after he passed away, it was all divided into 4 parts those 4 members include me, my mother and my 2 sisters. But by the norm, I am to inherit all the property. My mother and sisters agree with it. But I still want to do my married sisters good and give them some share once I get settled comfortably. \n\nBut the reason why I'm unable to get anything because I have zero property law knowledge, most of the documents are in Hindi from decades ago. I don't know anyone in this village, I don't know how to make property deals. I have been suffering a lot in my life and want to move abroad for a while to fix my mental state. The village I'm in is infamous for terrible people and property crimes. I don't want to get into all that hassle. \n\nBut I need some good amount of money to start a new life abroad. I'm requesting my brother in law to help me sell some part of the property because he had knowledge and connections but he doesn't. I'm so broken at this point that I just want to run away leaving everything behind my dad worked hard for me and never return. My mental condition keep deteriorating the more I stay here. \n\nTL;DR - I have all the indirect money in the world that I will need to start a new life anywhere but it's all non-liquid. The process of inheriting it to myself and converting it to liquid (direct money) is lengthy, full of hassles and risky. So, I have been thinking of giving up on it.",

I need some guidance regarding a loan dispute of my close friend.\nBack story: \nShe took a favor from a guy she knew for sum of Rs.50k and she told him that she'll give it back in a month or so, but failed to do so since 15 months, due to financial issues, demise of her father and she losing her job, it has been tough for her to manage and pay it back. Yet she used to reassure him that she will pay it back once she arranges the amount, they were in touch for the next 5 months after the money exchange, later when the guy used to force himself on her she stopped communicating with him and even stopped meeting him. There is no evidence available where she can prove that the guy used to do this. There was mental harassment as well.\n\nNow, she received a whatsapp text from him, a legal notice drafted by lawyer, which does not have lawyers number, stating that she took a loan from him and failed to pay back, and she has never replied to his calls or texts about this (which is false) and she has 15 days of time from this notice to pay him back with interest and the lawyers and legal charges making up the amount to 70k, if failed to do so, he will proceed legally with multiple charges.\n\nUpon this she replied saying that she has mostly responded him that she will pay back, and now she is not in a position to repay the whole amount or any sort of interest but she will pay back 50k sum in installments and she transferred Rs. 5k to him.\n\nTo this the guy responds : \n\"If you had paid me Rs.50k today instead of rs. 5k I would have reconsidered about not taking interest from you and would have taken only legal expenses that would make the total amount to ₹62500 but you're still trying to delay this.\nAnd since I have already hired a lawyer and paid his fees, I will not let it go to waste, the LEGAL TIMELINE for you to pay me back is 15 days since receiving the legal message from me.\n\nSo I am being very clear here, either you pay me the whole amount along with interest back, or I will file a case against you. And we will directly meet in court then.\"\nLater says, he'll settle for 50k + 5k legal expenses and forget the interest but you have to pay it before 25th or he'll take it to the court.\n\nNow, she is literally not in a position to pay back the full amount in 10 days, she will be able to manage to pay it in installments. Now what options does she have? How can she proceed with such threatening and mental harassment? How can she ask for extra time?\n\nKindly share your inputs, it'll be highly appreciated. Thank you.",

        "text": "\nI live in Mumbai, Dahisar, and the society next to my building is exclusively for members of the Gowd Saraswat Brahmin community. They have strict rules, allowing only Brahmins from their community to live there as owners or tenants.\n\nFor the past month, some retired elders in their society have started chanting \"Shree Ram, Jay Ram, Jaya Jaya Ram\" every day for 2-3 hours, beginning at 3 PM. As someone who is also a Brahmin and deeply devoted to Hanuman ji, I completely respect their devotion and the value of spiritual practices. However, the tone they use is identical to \"Ram naam satya hai\" (used at funerals), which makes it sound depressing and distracting. It sounds as if they're forcing themselves to say it instead of saying it out of love or devotion.\n\nThe area is super silent around here, and their chanting is loud, repetitive, and resonates throughout the area. While I wouldn’t call it noise, because chanting the name of Shree Ram isn’t noise, but it’s still difficult to focus when it continues for hours on end.\n\nThis has become a significant issue for me because I’m juggling a part-time job, two master’s degrees, and preparation for a competitive exam. These afternoon hours are the only time I get to study with focus, but the chanting has been making it nearly impossible to concentrate. Unfortunately, there are no libraries or study-friendly spaces nearby where I can work instead.\n\nI want to emphasize that I don’t begrudge them their devotion, and I’m genuinely happy to see such dedication. I just don’t know how to manage this situation without disrupting their routine or causing any conflict.\n\nRequesting them to stop or lower the volume doesn’t seem like an option. Has anyone faced something similar or have suggestions for how I could handle this respectfully? I’d truly appreciate any advice.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": " \n\n[Forcible sex](https://www.easykanoon.com/is-forcible-sex-ground-for-divorce/) after marriage or ‘marital rape’ mainly refers to sexual intercourse between a man and a woman, who is legally accepted as husband and wife, without the consent of the women for that intercourse.\n\nThe ancient patriarchs who came together to write their early covenants had used the rape of women to forge their male power- how then could they see rape as a crime of man against a woman? Women were wholly-owned subsidiaries and not independent beings.*-Susan Brown Miller (Against Our Will)*\n\nMan and woman make up a society. They are the pillars that keep humanity standing on their feet. However, as time passed a war of proving who is the best among man and woman, a war between the two universally known genders then, started and slowly male chauvinism started taking over the absolute control of the society with power and opportunities and marking the women population as lowly, docile and submissive and thus, discrimination and a gender-based disparity was established. Which started out as a joint responsibility soon became an exhibition to show the subordination of women with respect to men in every field. To prove the greatness of men and how the world and humanity deserve to be dominated by them, soon, violence becomes their ultimate answer to prove their masculinity. The strength became the measurement of capability. For centuries it had been a way to dominate the female population and keep them in that subordinate place assigned to them by men to showcase their powers. The manifestation of female submission has been played, for centuries, as a historic power strategy to establish male domination all over the world. Even the relationship between men and women, their matrimonial wedlock, which is still held to be a holy union all over the world and regarded as a fulfillment of bond and the ultimate goal of every romantic relationship between two people, proved to be a strategic approach to keep women below men. Having a woman as a spouse gave men a bundle of special powers to suppress them in the name of the family or brainwash them into thinking how they were only made for taking the subordinate roles to their husbands",

        "text": "I (26f) am a housewife with no children. I want to divorce my husband (33m) of 5 years. He refuses to give me children and I have waited long enough. The problem is he's done his best to make himself divorce-proof. He does cash jobs in the informal sector without a written contract or payslips. There is no paper trail for the court to follow. He keeps me in a cheap 1 BHK rental and has no secret properties or investments that I know of. Most of his income disappears into a black hole. It's possible he has hidden crypto assets, or maybe he spends it on alcohol, gambling and sex spas. I just don't know and he doesn't tell me anything when I ask. He operates on a minimalist lifestyle - no maid, no car, no iphone, no jewelry, no vacations. He takes me to a cheap restaurant twice per month, and that's the extent of his frivolous spending on me. He pays for my food & rent in exchange for me doing all household chores and cooking his meals. I feel cheated because he didn't deliver on what was initially promised (our family with children). I'm planning to divorce him and ask for maintenance, but in the absence of any proof of his income and given the cheapo lifestyle he's maintained since the beginning of our marriage, will the court award me with enough money to survive on my own?",

Got some meds. Doctor was confused about my condition as I'm ok but had to give meds as it's his job. \n\nI have taken a challenge to revise that everyone's life must exist in every moment daily till medicines are running and overcome instincts created by these medicines as I think this can end madness in the world if mad people will follow it .\n\nWe must be free to do what must be done i.e. whatever's life leading for me and others.\n\nIt's not like I tried to be free but I wanted to give a message to the world about this whole incident so that it won't happen to anyone and go unnoticed as well as how to stop it from happening in future with anyone and how those who are actually mad can be helped. I hope those meds won't have much side effects.

Also the creator explains that apart from the one-time settlement since the women is unemployed, husband have to pay for all of her expenses on a monthly duration, if there are children for them too, plus the expense include payin for her affairs too (affairs that happened after divorce).\n\nBasically the video explains how the judicial system has made men as a puppet of women in legal divorce cases and it takes too much effort (patience, calmness, image in society, self-esteem), money (for hiring attorneys), time (wastin in court trials) for a men to prove himself, if you lack any you're wasted.\n\nAlso, It depends on divorce to divorce, but lets take it worst case possible, lets say the women have an extra martial affair (pretty common these days in tier1 cities) which ultimately leads to divorce and also her character also degrades over a period of time, so in this situation.\n\n1.

Took   \nPepsi from the minibar with MRP Rs. 35, but they charged me Rs. 145.   \nChocolate from Minibar MRP - 120, charged me 200.   \n  \n*They said as a 5 Star hotel they can charge whatever they want*. \n\nI understand if we go to malls / airport or someplace fancy, they charge extra by just pouring the same into glass or if we take packaged the MRP are usually increased. But this is just blatant *Chori khule aam*.  \n  \nThey may argue service / convenience but really 400% of the MRP?  \n\nMy points:\n\n1. I have already paid for ambiances & convivences when I paid hotel room tariff. \n\n2. The SC judgement that says a 5 star can charge extra for the composite service should not be valid here as I have not paid room rent & minibar charges in one bill. Minibar charges is charged separately from the room tariff. \n\n3. As far as the convenience is argue, one may say there's 24\\*7 that supply good at all times, they aren't allowed to charge me extra for providing me with a service at 3 am at night.   \n  \n4. I think there should be some cap on it, as asking 400% of MRP is really not right, whatever be the ambiances / convenience or whatever they provide.  \n\nNeed advice & general input on this to understand the law more clearly.   \n",

I will consult more with my mother. I am not very much into what my family owns or whatever. My father gave me good education and simple lifestyle and seeing him tensed from few years my mood was off so asked here. He won't be telling anything directly about family tensions as he wants me do my own good and not get into family matters. Even knowing that we own this much my father wanted me to earn money through my job or whatsoever. That's why I regularly do freelancing & tutoring for my money. \n\nAbout property it mostly is non-agricultural land but near some state highway of UP and Bihar. In total it can be combined worth of 16-18Cr and rest 3-5Cr is a bungalow in good city. (Its not exact 21Cr but can range from 19-22Cr)\n\nThanks for overwhelming response, I am sorry that I can't reply anything useful regarding this. I thought **just for safety to know if there is some legal procedure if at last my father was really excluded.** But that would need more info. Apologies again.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ Earlier question was below.......\n\nMy grandfather is refusing to provide equal share to his three sons. The property to be inherited is worth \\~21 Cr (my mother said) (comprises of plain fertile lands, gutters or infertile land, and bungalows) to be (ideally) distributed among three but my grandfather says he will give it only to two elder brothers of my father. My father will be getting nothing.\n\nIf anyone wants the reason its simple that my father is short tempered and he often argues with my grandfather and also sometimes yells at him. When my grandfather says he won't get a penny of property he argues more. I feel sad seeing these state of affairs.\n\nIs there some legal route here so that my father can convince my grandfather, so that these family tensions can go away and equal distribution of wealth happens? My uncles (father's elder brothers) also internally don't want to share the property so they say they will do whatever my grandfather will decide (as it is anyway benefitting them).\n\nWe live a modest lifestyle and aren't poor but this property thing causes daily issues at home because my father's dream are big.",

        "text": "So a brief background. My first wife passed away many years ago when two of our daughters very very young. \n\nFew years ago I started dating another women and very early into the relationship she gets pregnant with our child. Initially as I had known her not for that long, so I refused to marry her. She anyway said that she wants to go ahead with this child and would like to bring this child up in a family. So we started living together.\n\nAt the time of delivery hospital staff, doctors repeatedly asked for the father of the child and with so much of explaining, and prioritising her mental health, and giving a child a legitimate name, I gave in to have some marriage registered.\n\nShe got hold of her three friends as witness and some priest from her temple to sign the forms and we registered the marriage with local municipality giving some arbitrary date as marriage date. No actually marriage under Hindu customs ever took place.\n\nSo say our daughter was born on 10th, our registration happened on 25th (after she was born), so as we don't face any hassle in giving her legal status.\n\nHowever it turned out that we were just not right for each other. Now few years down the line we have decided to live separately and given how things are this will mainly lead to a divorce.\n\nFor context, we both are working professionals and earn decent livings to provide for our kids and live a good life in a metro. I have more assets than her. \n\nAs long as it is mutual I am all for it, however if she suddenly starts asking for Alimony, by Hindu marriage act she can claim 1/3 of my assets. My lawyer has advised that this may get reduced as I am sole provider to my 2 daughters from my previous marriage, plus looking after my aging parents, so Alimony amount would get reduced substantially if I am able to show genuine liablities.\n\nMy question here is can alimony be nullified if I say we actually never got married under Hindu act, and registered marriage was only done to give me third daughter a legitimate name. Also if you see all witnesses and priest who signed the document were all from her side, which shows this was done under some duress that time.  \nI am ready to take 100% care of all my daughters.\n\nPlease advice.\n\n",

        "text": "Iam facing a situation where the zeal to work hard is dying. the cumulative tax burden on our income and spendings is unfair. Initially, our income is significantly reduced by income tax, and on top of that, we do not receive any GST exemption on the goods and services we purchase or sell, leading to a scenario of double taxation. I want to understand the legal basis for challenging this issue and explore all possible arguments and examples that justify this appeal to the Supreme Court against the tax authority.\n   \nStraightforward this is totally unfair that sometimes we’ve to pay 18-27% on gst on an income which is already taxed heavily without any guarantees and benefits.\n   \nAnd finally after everything you want to have some world class stuff to make this life less miserable we’ve to pay custom duties on it.\n  \n\nIn summary, I am seeking a legal remedy that calls upon the Supreme Court to direct the tax authority to modify the taxation mechanism, where the tax payers get some sort of relief somewhere. This would include reconsidering the current framework under GST in light of income tax liabilities, or make some relaxation in custom duties, or make the tax like toll, road substantially reduced or something in similar front. thus ensuring that my effective tax burden does not amount to a double taxation scenario. My ultimate goal is to achieve a balanced and equitable tax system that aligns with constitutional principles and promotes a fair environment.",

I've tried and failed so many times in my life and always have ended up in a worse spot than I was earlier. So far I've tried and failed in 3 different professions and have been failing since I was 14. Ever since I was in 6th grade I knew study wasn't something for me. Not that I was a bad at studies, till 5th I had topped my class and never fell below 3th rank, when in 5th I first announced that I don't want study further and would rather continue play some sport or learn some business. I was beaten by every single member of my family, a lot teachers from my school and even school bus driver who had come to drag me to school with my father. They changed my shool a year later, where I was dropped from football team in 10th (a team that I was captaining since 2 Years) because my maths teacher complaint to the principal about my low attendance and no performance in maths (I suck at math). So after 10th I quit school because the only reason I was going because I was playing football and they killed that for me at a crucial time when they where taking a district level team out, and they kept me out of it during the selection. Few months later during vacation I broke my leg to put a final nail in the coffin of my football journey. \n\nSince I couldn't go out I started playing video games, I was playing earlier as well when I didn't go to school, but that was for fun, now I was playing FPS (CS) and with more focus. In a few month I got better and started playing competitively (I ranked under 25 on game tracker in asia, LAN tourney, regional online tourney) Then started organising a few events ourselves. At this point I was on my own and didn't ask for any money from anyone(not that i had much expenses or got any pocket money earlier either), after sometime i with one of my friends started building our own map and game servers and was trying to get into the game development space. One night I was up either playing or working on a map when my father came in and beat the shit out of me, in next few days my PC and done for and I had nothing. Absolutely nothing at all. So I locked myself in my room and would stare at the ceiling day and night. I didn't do anything for over a year and one day ran away, I went to dehradun thinking I would meet my friends who where there but someone stole my phone around Delhi, I got off the train a few station before dehradun (it was standing for a long time to let pass some other train). The train left the station, I, 18.5 Y/O stood stranded 1100 kms away from home not knowing what to do I started walking on the railway track till I reached DDN railway station, there in 4 days I called my brother, who convinced me to come back.\n\n\nAfter some time I started working with a real estate agent as a sales exec. I was learning so he wouldn't pay me anything and I didn't mind it either, as I was getting better and got a grip on the trade covid lockdown happened. My father had just took VRS from his job in feb 2020. Now there's no one earning in the family. Once the 2nd lockdown was lifted I again started working with a real estate company, I earned some, lost a lot to their greed and theft. I worked with them for around a year, when I decided to form a team of my own and take my own marketing projects (my first business failure) I lost all my savings in a matter of a few months. I was in depression once again. \n\n\nI started working on myself for a sometime later joined a stock broking firm because I was done with the thief and goons of real estate. Within a 3 months I was promoted to TL, in next few months, one of the partners of the firm took upon a new venture and invited me to join him. I joined him, as soon as I joined him my salary went up 50% and overall earnings around 2-3x in the next 6 months I got promoted GM, heading the operations of this new venture everything seemed right but deep inside I wasn't happy. Around 8-9 months ago, my mother (has medical issues since past 15 years) and sister both were admitted in hospital for over 15 Days, I was already overworked in a job I wasn't very happy, I had 2 people in hospital, one on the verge of dying. All this and I get a very unpleasant and angry call from my boss and I quit right then and there. \n\nOver the next few months I spent a lot of time and money to start my own business in the same domain, I partnered with 3 people, out of whom 2 backed out after a quarter or so. I took some loans to keep the business alive. It's over 6 months I've been struggling, for a life I never enjoyed, earning for people who never loved me. I'm to the neck in debt, and recovery people are at my doors all the time, and everyone in my family making me feel like shit day after day. I don't think I have live to die a thousand different ways daily. So I ask you what is the best way to die, So far I've tried rat kill (I vomited violently felt lifeless but still alive). I've drank whole mosquito vaporizer liquid, didn't quite work. I've tried stabbing at my heart but couldn't generate enough power to penetrate. I'm afraid of height also there isn't many high-rise building that could give me a sure kill. Somebody on reddit said nitrogen gas would do the trick and would kill me  in my sleep without any pain, but at this moment that is out of my reach. There is carbon monoxide that could be tried but reports say that the survival rate is high and could cause brain damage. Help me with this one final request. I'm so done with this life. ",

I checked out this place few days ago and absolutely LOVED it. Although it was a little over my budget, I still went ahead. I spoke to the flatmates for almost 2 hours and didn't find any red flags and thought everything is as per my needs. \n\nI even put down a token amount of 25k before leaving the apartment when I went to visit. But the next day I did some math and realised that paying deposit, maintenance, rent and the setup cost for the apartment was too big of an amount (1.2 lakhs total upfront) for me to put upfront and that it is not a wise financial decision  to lock a big amount like that. \n\nSo I called the owner the next day to tell him I'm no longer interested and that he should refund my token amount. And he refused saying tokens are non refundable and that I should find a replacement and he would consider the token paid. \n\nHis property manager forwarded me this message earlier today\n\n\"The token is always non refundable as was conveyed to her prior transaction. The decision on her part was made after thought. \n\nA relatively big amount was quoted so that we don't entertain non-serious prospects and avoid situations exactly like this one.\nWe declined other people because of her and we face the loss due to her careless and hurried decision. She was not forced to put down the token, she did so as a functioning adult capable of taking decisions. \n\nIf decisions like this could be flipped, then what purpose would token amounts serve? It would be useless to collect tokens.\n\nThere are only two things we can do for her here:\n1. If she is able to find someone to take her spot from March 1st, we can accept and consider the entire token amount to be given to us by the replacement.\n2. We can refund 20k to her from our end if and only if we are able to find a replacement by March 1st. The 5k will be withheld as penalty charges for our losses.\n3. If we are unable to find a replacement by March 1st, the 25k is forfeited.\n\nHer unprofessional behaviour has cost us convertible leads. And hence there must be compensation for the same. \n\nIncase she disagrees to this arrangement, clarify to her that this is a civil matter not a cybercrime matter and that she should file it in the civil court. She will hear from my lawyer if and after she chooses to do so.\"\n\n25k token amount is big amount for me and cannot afford to lose it. What should I do?

The past few Indian Legal advice subs were very small with a miniscule amount of people so I didn't consider it. \n A distant (but close in that we talk online and on phone from time to time) family member has fears of having commited various crimes and has been depressed and suicidal for an entire year. And from his description , it very well seems like he did end up doing those things and doesn't know what to do. He's piss poor and afraid of the Indian legal and police system. I'm somewhat knowledgeable on the legal system but not as much and I'm also not in a position to provide financial support. What can be done to help him.he's only told me about it and his health seems to be in ruins? He's too scared to even seek help or look for what he can or can't do because of his institution that he's doomed. Honestly knowing his fears and what he's afraid of and did in detail , I think it makes a lot of sense for him to be this way right now. I'm the only person who knows about this. While I wasn't explicitly asked for help from him. His situation is deeply uncomfortable and I highly doubt he would be able to navigate through this alone. I surely don't want anything bad to happen to him\n\nEdit;; turns out his fears are not real and he didn't do anything and he's either way too gullible or  stupid to believe his friends when they lie to him lol",

Our lords who are so disconnected from society believes that women are incapable of cruelty and violence the same way men are capable of and hence considers gender when dishing out verdicts too. Word of mouth is more than enough to put any innocent guy, his siblings, their parents into jail and automatically rewarding custody of their children to the same evil in-laws and evil wife as a result with all their earnings too....\n So what are the odds that Indian men start\ntaking law into their own hands instead of the\ncurrent trend of unaliving themselves? The indian legal system has put them in such a state that\nwouldn't they start considering unaliving the wife and in-laws and then unaliving themselves. Isn't that a\nbetter alternative than the current biased laws. The men wouldn't lose their hard earned money, the parents wont be tortured by judges like atul subash case, the kid won't be raised to hate their dad by the evil in-laws who supported their evil daughter in all the fake allegations... How many non-sharia men\nwould start considering that alternative and wouldn't that be problematic for our society in the long run?",

Due to the argument, the flight got cancelled and I was detained for a day. Now 8 months later the said airline sent me an email demanding compensation of around 100000$ and blaming the flight cancellation on me tbh I was a muslim travelling in the said airline and felt their behaviour to be very racist. I'm worried now that they will sue me if I fail to pay it but I have no plans on going back to the said country. I am wondering now , can they sue me in Indian court ?\n\nEdit: Some people are accusing me of playing victim card here or what has all this to do with me being Muslim. I'd like to clarify that once the police was there and I was being taken away, I told them if I can get my carry on bag from the plane. They let me take it with me but in the letter I received , I'm being accused of making some statement regarding my carry on bag which alarmed the crew and they ordered the whole plane to be searched for bombs or something. How is asking to get my carry on bag = making a bomb threat ? Before accusing me of playing some victim card, ask yourself . If it was a european white guy asking to remove his carry on bag, would they have ordered a bomb squad for him as well ? They have mentioned in the letter that calling this bomb squad resulted in the plane being evacuated and caused it to cancel the flight. How am I liable for them cancelling the flight . I didn't make any threats or arguments and left the plane when the cops took me. ",

However, on **Day 1**, I suffered a **serious injury (Grade 3 ankle sprain -complete rapture of legament & hairline fracture)** while playing. The issue is not just the injury but **how the academy handled it:**\n\n1. The **coach saw me fall but did not assist or offer any medical help. Instead asked me to move out of the court and asked me to go home and sleep and by morning it would be good.** \n2. When I went to the **academy office for first aid**, they **had no ice pack or spray (Move spray was out of stock).**\n3. I had to **go home on my own, without any help or medical attention.**\n4. Later, when I visited a doctor, I was diagnosed with a **Grade 3 ankle sprain and a hairline fracture**.\n5. I reached out to the academy for a **refund**, but they said they have a **\"No Refund in Any Circumstances\" policy** (this is written on the bill/receipt).\n6. The **person I spoke to refused to give me phone number, name etc of the owner**\n\nI feel this is **clear negligence** on their part since they **failed to provide basic medical assistance** to an injured player.\n\n# My Questions:\n\n1. Can I **file an FIR** under **IPC Sections 336, 337, and 338** (negligence causing harm)?\n2. Can I **file a case in Consumer Court** under the **Consumer Protection Act, 2019**, for **\"deficiency in service\"** and demand a refund + medical expenses?\n3. Since their **No Refund policy** is written on the receipt, will that prevent me from getting a refund legally?\n4. If I **post my experience on social media** (Google reviews, Justdial, etc.), will that help put pressure on them?\n5. Any other legal options I should consider?\n\nWould really appreciate any expert opinions or experiences from people who have dealt with similar cases.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Later, my friend installed the app again and then received 4k to his account. \n\nThe next day, he received a call from an unknown number demanding 10k and if not complied they threatened to release my friend's morphed pics using his gallery pics. They even threatened him of leaking the WhatsApp and SMS conversations. Out of fear, he immediate sent 4k. Within a span of 3 days they squeezed 50k out of him. After this much drama only he informed us. We all have scolded him for not telling the scammers to do what they want with the pics. He was quiet and didn't say much.\n\nCan you please advise what can be done in this case? Is it possible to recover the transferred amount? Also, how to protect from future calls from these/other scammers as his personal data might be shared among scamsters group?",

She is an Indian woman based in KL, she has been residing there for the last 18 years with her husband and two daughters. \n\nThey are both Indian citizens, married in India and marriage certificate also issued from India but they never lived in India for their entire married life. \n\nHer husband owns a property in Mumbai, the rest of the assets are in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (KL), including businesses, which she has worked for over the years without compensation. She has ownership over shares though. \n\nThe situation is that the husband has been emotionally abusive for many years now and my friend is finally fed up. She wants a divorce but believes it’s only right for the husband to pay alimony to support the two daughters since my friend is a housewife and has been so all along. \n\nShe has filed a divorce petition in KL but she will only find out towards end of the month if the KL courts believe they have jurisdiction over their marriage. \n\nMeanwhile, her coward of a husband has fled KL. He has gone to Mumbai and filed a divorce petition there. He has accused her of “cruelty” and other atrocious things and has said he wants a divorce based on this. He has not mentioned anything about his daughters or any offer of alimony, just baseless accusations. \n\nShe has received the court notice from Mumbai courts and has a hearing set for February sometime. \n\nMy friend cannot leave KL for two reasons: \na) She is the primary caregiver for the two daughters and wants to provide them as much stability as possible which means they attend school and do all their day to day stuff. \nb) She doesn’t have the financial means.\n\nShe is seeking advice on the following aspects: \n1)\tDo the Indian courts in fact have jurisdiction over their marriage even though they never lived in India? \n2)\tDoes a wife have any rights by marriage in India? \n3) Does she have to be physically present for the hearings in India? \n4)\tWill any judgement made by Indian courts be enforceable in KL? I.e. can she make a claim over both India and KL assets? Her main purpose is to secure financial support for the daughters until they complete college education. \n5)\tHow much, REALISTICALLY, does it cost to file for divorce in India? All lawyers she has consulted so far have quoted in LAKHS. She is a housewife, he controls their finances and she has little savings.\n\nAny other advice you might have for her?  She just wants to be free of this man but secure her daughters’ futures.",

        "text": "I ordered two pairs of Levi jeans from Myntra on December 7. \nLevi's Slim Slim ( A )\nLevi's Straight Fit ( B )\nOn December 13, my parcel was delivered. When I opened the parcel, the jeans were totally different from the ones shown in the photos, so I thought they were fake. I immediately registered a complaint with customer care. They asked me to upload photos on the Myntra app, which I did. I told them that I didn’t want a refund; I wanted an exchange. They said okay, but I had to wait 48 hours. I agreed to wait. \n\nOn December 15, I got a text message that my query had been solved. I checked the Myntra app and it said that they would pick up my item and refund my money. Instead of exchanging, they raised a refund. I didn’t want a refund; I wanted to exchange the jeans for the ones shown in the photos. \nSo I called customer care again and asked to speak to their supervisor. He refused and said that their support team had decided that they would refund my money and not exchange it. I told him that this product was fake, it was not the same as the photos, it was totally different. In frustration, I told him that I would complain to the consumer court. Then I hung up the call. After that, I cancelled the refund request on the Myntra app. After two days, on December 17, I saw an option to exchange the jeans. I thought that if I exchanged these jeans, I would get the Right ones (the ones in the photos). I exchanged one of Levi’s products ( A ). \nOn December 19, I got the exchanged item, but I was shocked. It was again the same jeans. The delivery guy told me to call customer care and say that I wanted to exchange my product and change its seller. I called customer care and told them the story. He said it's not possible to change seller and told me that their backend team would re-investigate it and I had to wait another 48 hours. I’m so frustrated. Why do I have to wait more? \n\nHere is the product link for which I exchanged: http://www.myntra.com/mailers/bottomwear/levis/levis-men-slim-fit-low-rise-light-fade-stretchable-jeans/21926916/buy ( A ) This is proof that I got a different product from Myntra. Its material does not match what Myntra has mentioned, as you can see in the image. Even the branding is different (I received Levi’s Red Loop jeans).\n The second product - http://www.myntra.com/mailers/bottomwear/levis/levis-men-straight-fit-stretchable-jeans/18973638/buy ( B )\nThis is a different product from what I ordered. The material does not match, and the manufacturer of the jeans is different. In the photos, you can see that it has four buttons instead of a zip, but the one I received has a zip. I don’t know why they sent me a different product twice. I only want the jeans that I ordered, not any other product. I have been waiting for 13 days.\n\n Seller Name - Vision Star Customer care keeps saying they sell authentic products, but I know that’s not true. But I received a totally different product from what I ordered. I'm attaching the image for reference to what I received. I'm tired of waiting. I demanded they send me the same product immediately. I want action on this. \n\nSo after this, I exchanged the product again, but still received a different product. I told him I didn't want a refund. I want to exchange products. They told me this is the seller's fault, so why do I have to suffer? I ordered during the Myntra EORS Sale. I want them to send me the Right product or please change the seller so I can get the same product that I ordered.\n\nOn December 18, I submitted an exchange request for Levi's Straight Fit Jeans ( B ). The jeans were delivered on December 23; this time, I got the right product. \n\nSo only one product left which is Levi's Slim Fit Low Rise Jeans ( A )so I complained on X (Formerly Twitter) and they responded that I'll get a call from their case manager. Later, I received a call and told them this is my 3rd time exchanging; please do something; I want my right product. They assured me that this time you'll get the right product but you have to wait till January 31st. I checked the Myntra app this time they cha5nge seller ( Vision Star to Levi's ) .. Earlier They had refused that the seller would not be changed but now They changed it.\nI kept asking why do I have to wait more? They Keep Saying It's part of the process..\nI agreed to wait.\n\n On December 30th,  I received the product but again it's different. I'm so frustrated why do I get a different product again? This is not my fault; why do I have to suffer this? Myntra should send me the right product. I am so frustrated; \n\nCompensation for Mental Agony and wasting my Time\n\nI got these jeans  in 1618 INR\nNormal price without sale is 6500+ INR\n\nNow what should i do ?\nI already complained 3 times in consumer court but no help .",

I informed my manager of this decision verbally, without providing a written notice. Our company mandates a two-month notice period. My manager expressed the desire to shift my reporting structure to B, a change I accepted in good faith. \n\nI promptly requested my HRBP to update my manager tagging, a process that took 18 days. Subsequently, I formally submitted my resignation on 14th Aug, designating my last working day as 24th Sep. I calculated this date from my initial verbal communication with my manager on 27th July.\n\nHowever, my F&F document arrived, and the payroll team deducted 18 days' salary, citing 14th Aug as the resignation date, retrieved from the system.\n\nUpon discussing this with my HRBP, I was informed that my notice period couldn't be waived. Since I lack written documentation before 14th Aug, I recently contacted my manager. I recorded our conversation where he acknowledged my resignation on 27th July. This recording serves as my sole evidence. Seeking advice on the best course of action to recover the deducted salary.",

However, my payout has been low on Swiggy even though the sales have been decent.\nEg. out of 1 lakh sales, swiggy only paid me around 27k. The rest they took as service charge and additional charges.\n\nOne checking on these details, I found out thst Swiggy has applied coupons and additional service packs/ add ons without our knowledge. When I confronted them about this the POC and support gave me a lazy response and told me “the previous POC/ employee had added these by mistake around 2020 time” and that we should have told them earlier itself.\n\nHow do they expect us to know the mess up from their ex employee? We were never informed about additional packs added and found it out on our own only?\nI don’t feel it is right from Swiggy’s part to make changes on the business offers and additional priority packs without permission or acknowledgment from my father’s side. My father has never confirmed or requested for any additional packs or freebie discounts which Swiggy has added without permission. We work with Zomato as well and have never faced anything like this before.\n\nImagine the sales we’ve made all this while and how much Swiggy has been leaching off us with their “service packs” which they added without consent. How is this fair ? The negligence from Swiggy and their employee to make changes to my business without our permission has resulted in them unfairly taking huge portion of our sales.\n\n\nIn short, Swiggy made changes to our business by adding discounts and additional service packs without any permission and acknowledgment from my feather. They now say it’s our fault even though it was the mistake of their ex employee/ previous POC.",

He stopped giving her money for luxuries and even for basic expenses, despite spending plenty on himself.\n\nPriya tried to stand up for herself and ask for a divorce, but raj cleverly claimed that he didn't own anything and didn't take any income from the family business. This meant that even if Priya asked for alimony, there would be no way for her to receive it. She suffered mental and emotional abuse at the hands of her husband, and her once-promising life had become a living nightmare.\n\nNow, at the young age of 27, Priya is faced with an ultimatum from raj. He plans to move to the USA to study and has told her that she can either serve his parents or get lost. Priya is devastated and unsure of what to do, but she knows that she cannot continue to live in this toxic relationship. She must find a way to escape and rebuild her life on her own terms\n\n\nHow can she get compensated to restart her life?

Maintenance work will only continue if dues are cleared. The builder emphasizes that water pump electricity bills paid by the society won't offset the dues, and internal maintenance claims must be raised separately. Non-payment will lead to service suspension.",

Since, I did not know about this rule, there I did not receive any money for the ticket that did not get confirmed. As it happens with most terms and conditions, general public like me don't go through them entirely but I do not understand the logic as to why IRCTC gets to keep the entire money and also not allow the passenger to board the train. IRCTC customer executive informed me that the TTE knows about it and they issue something called TDR but the TTE did not inform the passenger who was traveling on the train regarding the rules either.

Adultery is no more a criminal offence but is a good ground for divorce. The government cannot bring back the adultery laws as it would be unconstitutional after the Supreme Court's judgement in Joseph Shine. A major individualistic approach was taken by the Court in this case recognizing the women's right to sexual autonomy and right over her reproductive parts under Article 21 of the Constitution. This gives her the right to sleep with whoever she wants. This right is directly detrimental to the institution of Marriage and tries to adopt the western approach ignoring the Indian ethos.\n\nI hope that in future such position of law is changed by the Supreme Court otherwise God bless India!!  \n\n\nEdit 1: I don't have the time to comment and fight the misandrists who haven't even read the summary of the Judgement. I simply want to put one question before them...Can a marriage survive if people are allowed to commit adultery? If your answer is yes, then you should be ready to bear illegitimate Children.",

I do not believe in borders.\n- I've pondered the idea of getting some type of deterrent, like a dog, but I'm unsure if that would be effective or just create more problems.\n- The goats are dumber than most I've encountered.\n\nIf the goats ram towards me, can I argue self-defense?",

My baby is currently 1.5 y/o and have been going through a nasty divorce... he is accusing me many false things. I was accused that I had alcohol during pregnancy, habit of going out without telling him ,  has weird habits of watching corn and toys and was accused of assault against my husband. He accused me of lacking a hygiene, he even mentioned that i have wierd habit of farting infront of his guests in the divorce notice etc... all nonsense bullshitI never did any of them except for owning a toy. Infect he and my inlaws harrassed me and my parents for dowry. Restricted my phone calls, denied me from accepting baby shower gifts from my parents and what not. He goes crazy when he is mad and throws things around wile hurling verbal abuses. He is highly educated from a very reputed (graduate from one of the top 5 universities in the world). he was controlling af. And when I came back to my parents house when my child is 6 mo the old he held onto both my babyand my passports and all the other personal documents..like all of them social security, education degrees and my American visa also expired .. forgot to mention my baby is an American citizen and I was working .. he Essentially destroyed my career, my hard-earned degree, tuition fee, my 1 kg of gold is also with him. And HE INITIATED DIVORCE accused me of cruelty against him. Now he sent another notice asking me to send  my bank details so that he will send the child support money and that he and his parents wants to have interim.custody of 2 weekends every month. Eventhough my baby is very young, I am afraid he has bad intentions in asking for this..I thinks he wants to gain any evidence or the chance to fabricate some false evidence against me to steal my child from me or to make my life even more miserable by polluting my child's mind. I want to make negotiations about money. He robbed me of 4 years hardworking of my life, my studies(from USA, i am from india), my job, my 1 kg gold and 2 kgs silver, and additional responsibility of my baby. And his lawyer is ruthless and very strong one. He has money and he is willing to spend on these legal things..Whereas my patrbts are old and have no strength to fight, I have no job yet, my baby's temporary visa was expired and is an illegal resident now...I am weak mentally and financially.  HELP ME. how can I avoid giving the interim custody for now.. I am okay to visitation after everything is settled, like legally and monetarily. I don't want him to take advantage of me\n..please help me how to negotiate this..",

How does it save the individuals in an unfortunate circumstance of a divorce?\n\nUpdate 1: As pointed out by the community, it seems like there is no concept of prenup in India, dang those Hollywood movies. \nThere has to be something that can be done before the marriage though??\n\nUpdate 2: Thanks for the healthy discussion! It seems like there does not exist any such law in India. There were some references to transferring assets to mom, but it would only work out if it's done at least 3 years before the marriage. Also, thanks to the lawyers who reached out, it seems like there does not seem to be a straight forward way, and it depends a lot on the judge who is seeing your case.",

        "title": "How to Protect Yourself from Property Fraud in India: A Step-by-Step Guide",
        "text": "Buying property is a big deal, but what happens if the documents turn out to be fake? Property fraud, especially involving forged documents, is a real issue in India, and the consequences can be financially and emotionally draining. If you’ve fallen victim to property fraud or want to avoid it, here’s a simple guide to help you out.\n\n# Steps to Take if You're a Victim of Property Fraud\n\n**1. Report the Fraud to the Police** The first thing you need to do is file an FIR (First Information Report) at your local police station. This is what officially kicks off the investigation. Make sure to mention the sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) that apply:\n\n* Section 420: Cheating and dishonest inducement of property\n* Section 467: Forgery of documents\n* Section 471: Using forged documents\n\nThese legal provisions help the authorities investigate the fraud and catch the criminals involved.\n\n**2. Verify the Sale Deed** Head to the sub-registrar’s office where the sale deed was registered. If the documents are fake, the registration can be canceled. The sub-registrar’s office is key in identifying fraud, so it’s worth checking if the documents were properly registered.\n\n**3. Take Legal Action** To reverse the fraud, you’ll need to challenge the sale in court. A civil suit can help:\n\n* Declare the sale deed invalid\n* Reverse the transaction, either returning the property to you or stopping the fraudster from selling it\n\nThis step is essential to ensure your legal rights are protected.\n\n**4. Verify Ownership of the Property** Check the property’s title deed at the Land Records Office to ensure the seller is the rightful owner. This can uncover any inconsistencies that indicate fraud. Confirming ownership is crucial before moving forward with any transactions.\n\n**5. Hire a Property Lawyer** A good property lawyer is worth their weight in gold. They will:\n\n* Help with the FIR and legal paperwork\n* Collect evidence like forged documents\n* Represent you in court\n\nHaving expert guidance can save you time and effort, ensuring the process runs smoothly.\n\n**6. Seek Compensation** If recovering the property isn't possible, you can still seek compensation. A civil suit can help you recover:\n\n* The money you paid for the fake property\n* Additional damages for stress, legal fees, and other losses\n\nYou shouldn’t have to suffer financially just because of someone else’s scam.\n\n**7. Prevent Future Fraud** Once your case is resolved, take some steps to prevent this from happening again:\n\n* File a caveat with the sub-registrar to stop any future fraudulent sales of the property.\n* Keep an eye on property ownership records to catch any unauthorized changes.\n\n**8. Don’t Wait Too Long** Remember, there’s a time limit to take legal action. You typically have three years from discovering the fraud to file a complaint. Delaying it could harm your chances of getting justice.\n\n# How to File a Complaint Against Fake Documents\n\nIf you’ve been scammed with fake property documents, follow these steps to file a complaint:\n\n* **Authenticate the documents**: Check with relevant authorities to confirm whether the papers are genuine.\n* **Gather evidence**: Collect copies of the forged documents, payment receipts, and communication with the seller.\n* **File the complaint online**: Many states allow you to submit complaints online. Check the specific process in your area.\n\n# Tips to Avoid Property Fraud:\n\n* **Verify the seller’s identity**: Check government IDs to ensure they match the title deed.\n* **Use trusted brokers**: Work with brokers who have a good reputation. It’s worth doing a background check.\n* **Hire experts**: Legal and property consultants can spot issues that might be missed otherwise.\n\n# How Zolvit Can Help:\n\nProperty fraud can be overwhelming, but you don’t have to go through it alone. Zolvit offers expert support in navigating the legal process, ensuring that your documents are properly checked, and representing you in court if needed. Our team can help you recover losses and protect your rights.\n\nDon’t let property fraud derail your plans. Contact Zolvit today for the help you need.",

        "text": "TL;DR\n\nAfter an arranged marriage and two years together, I relocated to Europe for work, with my wife agreeing to join me in six months. However, she repeatedly postponed her move, citing family events. Eventually, she refused to return to our matrimonial home, claiming she didn’t want to live there without me and didn’t marry to serve my parents, despite them treating her like a daughter.\n\nMonths later, I visited India, but we hadn’t spoken during that time. Her father came to discuss the situation, bringing several relatives, which upset us as it made a private matter public. After heated arguments, I compromised, giving her another chance, and she agreed to join me in Europe. However, she again delayed and never returned, continuing to blame me and my parents for everything.\n\nThe situation escalated when her family started defaming us publicly and threatening me. They demanded I return to India for discussions, where she expressed her desire for separation. They refused to talk over the phone and even filed a case against me (I came to know this after the mediation process), demanding a large sum of money. Despite mediation, which was biased in her favor, I respected the mediation, hoping for improvement.\n\nHowever, her behavior didn’t change, and she still harbors mistrust on me and resentment towards my parents. After trying everything, I’ve asked her for a peaceful settlement, but I’m unsure what complications may arise if she refuses. She has left our matrimonial home twice in 2.5 years of time span. We don’t have children.",

While leaving the house, he didn't take any of their shared belongings - he just said he wanted to leave and didn't want anything. Now, after 6 months, he wants everything back. He invested in a property with my sister, so he wants his share back (7-8 lakhs, its in my sister's name), and he also wants the car, which he bought (current value 5-6 lakhs, currently in my sister's name), as well as some household items (worth 50k-60k).\n\nMy sister says she has been paying the rent (around 14-15L for all the years) and many of his expenses for the past 7 years. He changed his career after their wedding, starting from the bottom, and didn't earn much for most of the marriage. However, he says that doesn't matter and he just wants his assets back.\n\nFor the past 2 months, he has been texting and calling all our family members to pressure them (even abusing them sometimes). He even came to my sister's house late one night, banging on the door to get his things. My sister filed a complaint at the police station the next morning. The police conducted counseling, but it didn't help. He didn't return to the police station for further counseling.\n\nNow, his friends are suggesting a mutual divorce, returning everything he asked for, and moving on, as both of them don't want to live together. Our friends also say there is no point in going to court as the case will just go on forever with no results, and you will waste your life. What is the best course of action here?",

The doctor told me to rest properly when I'm home how will I rest here??/\n\n\n\nFast forward to today \n\nI had to sleep in our storeroom because my sister gets delusional about me being her enemy\n\n\n\nNext day\n\nI was casually speaking with my mother when she herself said that it is not possible to sleep in such a place so i told her that why didn't she clean the place if she knew I was coming home and i have to sleep their she averted the question and I said that father kept getting angry at me despite it being their own fault I was just so sick of them for not caring at all about my health from the last 3 months\n\nThis led an argument and after it settled down i had dinner\n\nWhile having dinner my sister came to talk with my mom\n\nThe lights were off and she was speaking to my mom I had no problem\n\nNeither did my sister BUT my mom did\n\nShe started angrily shouting eat faster\n\nThe doctor told me to eat slowly\n\nI said I cannot eat faster but I will go upstairs after this\n\nShe said NO EAT FASTER and then she started arguing with me IGNORING MY MENTALLY ILL SISTER\n\nIf she cares that much about my sisters mental health why does she not talk to her and instead argue with me which gives her more anxiety????\n\nNow my sister starts shouting and really loud gut wrenching screams \n\nMy mother is still urging me to go upstairs my mentally ill sister is still shouting at my mother but she is ignoring her\n\nLike if you care about her mental health talk to her instead of arguing with me\n\nI say she doesn't care why are you telling me to go upstairs??\n\nShe says I AM THE HOUSE OWNER YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME (still she has an unreasonable request)\n\nThen my sister tried to hit me because my mother isn't listening to her because she is busy arguing with me\n\nMy mother again calls the police after a whole lot of telling made up lies to the police she says they are on their way\n\n\n\nWhat am I supposed to do?\nDo i have any rights in this situation please keep in mind that I have College entrance exams in 17 days 🙏",

I feel cheated because she is set on a motive of not coming back and that was really unexpected and i think she is going to file a case for divorce and claim for alimony.\n\nShe has no proof for my bad behaviour because it never happened and all her accusations are just to leave me because I don't earn much. However, she may have proof of me asking for her forgiveness because I just wanted her back somehow. I did not consent to her accusations but I said sorry for doing any mistake from my part.\n\nI earn 10k a month. Which isn't much. But I have an FD account on my name of 10L which my father left me with. And some shares which are about 9-10L. The marriage is recent and it's about to be 1 year in a few days. \n\nPlease guide me what should I do? Should I transfer my shares to my mother's account now? And what should I do about my FD? i am not worried about my salary because it isn't much. I have some property but it's on my mother's name from the beginning.\n\nShe also took a lot of gold before leaving and I'm worried if she will give it back to me or not",

        "text": "VCare is a famous skin and hair treatment clinic all over India and today I took a doctor appointment there because they said free doctor appointment for one day because of festival and made me pay 400 alone for \"skin test\" which was quite ironic but since it was only 400, I thought it wouldnt hurt and decided to give it a shot. Today afternoon I reach there and take a bunch of skin tests and told me that I'd have to do prp micro needling treatment in order to fix my acne scars. First of all, I only went there to enquire the price for a CO2 laser surgery and they ended up suggesting me an entirely diff treatment. Even though I was vocal with the doctor lady that I needed time to first think about it before deciding (obviously its my body) and that I also needed time to collect the cash but she kept peer pressuring me into accepting the treatment by saying its only one day discount and that if I pay 90k I can get it done immediately. I stood on my business and told her I cant afford it right now until she started talking to me about EMI plans. I didnt know how to get myself out of that so I thought I'd act like Im interested and since I had an average credit score because of multiple loans and few bounces, I thought Id play along for a while before I have to fully decline the offer. So she invited some guy into the room and he started making me click some bajaj links and asked for a lot of OTPs inorder to check credit eligibility and the result came out to be ineligible as I expected but then she came up with a new plan saying she has another lender and will ask him. Since I already put myself through all this I thought I'll go along for one last time to see what happens because they can take my money without my consent, right? right????\n\nthats where I was wrong. She finally called up this new dude who was not in person but on phone who said he was from \"FIBE\" and even tho I was not supposed to be eligible he came back saying Im eligible for a 40k loan which was definitely not possible because I already have so many loans opened and been rejecting by a lot of banks. It was literally impossible but this nigga made it work somehow and he caught me off guard on giving away an otp for loan disbursement and they ended up disbursing the loan to VCare without even starting the treatment or any paperwork or even my signature. I called up fibe customer service and told them to cancel the loan and they said its not possible from their end since the money has already been disbursed and until VCare sends them the money back they cant cancel the loan. I was like \"wow wtf did these scammers get me into\". So I called up the shady \"fibe\" guy and asked him about it and he said I gave my consent when I shared that OTP even tho I was not fully aware of what that OTP was for. They took like multiple OTPs from me including my Aadhar OTP on digi locker so I thought this was just another OTP and gave it to him only to find out later that I have a 40k loan to repay for which I didnt even get any service. This is daylight fraud and Im sure they know it too. Im currently talking to them on the phone about it but they havent got back to me like they said which is quite ironic because till the moment I went to the clinic they kept spamming my phone asking if Im coming for the consultation or not but now they have conveniently stopped calling anymore. I'm trying my best to resolve this without taking a legal action because end of the day I just want my money back. Im gonna visit them once again in person otherwise I'm gonna have to lawyer up and file an FIR. If there's a possibility I can sue please let me know because this is just daylight fraud and Im sure there must be many other victims like me. Cant believe I got scammed by a doctor, was not counting to see it on my bucket list of an average experience in India",

Amir Idrasi'.\nThat is all he said and walked off.\n\nThe Youtuber followed my brother along with two of his people. They tried talking to my brother's friends.\nOne of the friends explained that my brother's last name is 'Shukla' and he was just messing around.\n\nThey continued following my brother and his friends. The Youtuber told my brother that he is only there to promote wearing Dhoti in public space.\nMy brother told him that randomly coming up to him and asking him to say Jai Shree Ram isn't right. Also, he told the YouTuber that he is presuming my brother's religion by doing so.\n\nThe Youtuber cherry picked up Saying Jai Shree Ram isn't right from 'My brother told him that randomly coming up to him and asking him to say Jai Shree Ram isn't right.' They kinda cornered my brother by saying you are disrespecting our 'Ram'. You disrespect our 'Ram', we'll beat you up.\n\nAll of this while recording my brother and his friends.\n\nNow, that Youtuber has upload a Short on his channel and he has portrayed my brother as some guy who is disrespecting Ram. He has also beeped my brother saying 'Okay-Okay' and made it look like my brother's cussing at him.\nI understand that the Progressive audience would really not care and understand that my brother wasn't being disrespectful at all.\n\nBut coming from Uttar Pradesh, most of the audience is pretty backward.\nNow, some students from my brother's school have picked this Short and have posted it on their own Instagram stories.\nPeople are commenting on the Short, saying that my brother should have been beaten up and worse.\n\nIt is definitely affecting him and I'm not sure how to handle this in the right way. My initial thought was to go find the YouTuber and break a limb on him but I want to tackle this legally.\n\nPlease suggest me what I can do or not do.\n\nAlso, please feel free to ask any questions.",

        "text": "Characters:\n\nM - he is my friend, the concerned person here.\n\nIsh- friend of M\n\nN- girlfriend of Ish\n\nS- friend of N, the antagonist.\n\nAct I :\n\nIt is the first day of college, and the college in which M took admission was in a different city, and none of the face is familiar to M. He happens to meet Ish, whose also it is the first day.\n\n*\\[After a few months of their friendship. On phone call\\]*\n\nIsh: M, I got to tell you something about my relationship.\n\nM: Aha! I’m interested.\n\nIsh: Her name is N. She is in our college, I will introduce you to her tomorrow. I have told her about you.\n\nAct II:\n\nIsh introduces M to N, and they formed a good bond.\n\n\\[Overtime, Ish and N started using M as their messenger and sometimes as arbitrator. Here the difficult part to understand is the role of M between the relationship of Ish and N, the very first question arises here is: Is N and M attracted to each other? No, this M is still a meek person who couldn’t get someone he wanted and is on spree of helping everyone out with their love. The sole intention of becoming an intermediary between Ish and N was to help them find their true love in each other or to help them see each other’s love as unconditional.\\]\n\nM and N are sitting, and Ish is not present.\n\nN: There is something important I wanted to talk to you.\n\nM: yes?\n\nN: There is a friend of mine, S, who is suffering through depression, and as I have found you to be the best counselor and a guide, I think I must introduce you to her.\n\nM: We can see into it, but what’s the issue with her?\n\nN: We will see…\n\n\\[*N makes a conference call, connecting herself, S and M\\]*\n\nN: S, let me introduce you to M. He is a very nice person and really, it seems, he knows about everything.\n\nS: Hello, M\n\nM : Hi\n\n….\n\n\\[And they began to get along. M goes to a third city (third in the sense that not his hometown, not even college town) for some career options. It must be mentioned that S doesn’t study in the same college as M, Ish and N.\\]\n\nAct III:\n\nNow, S and M have become connected without anyone in between. M is still doing his job of intermediary and messenger between Ish and N. Ish knows about the new connection of S and M.\n\nThe intentions of S now have begun to take material form.\n\nOn WhatsApp:\n\nS: M, I have never found anyone like you, you’re the best.\n\nM: that’s not important. Your health must recover.\n\nS: You’re most important for me. I want to be yours.\n\nM: We all are God’s.\n\nS: I want to say it straight, I… L… Y…\n\nM: this is not acceptable to me, and it must be stopped.\n\nM at once closes his WhatsApp and blocks off S from everywhere possible. He informs N about it, but she replies that she didn’t know if S would do such a thing. Similarly, Ish replies to M.\n\nM begins to feel he is getting in a trap.\n\nAct IV:\n\nAfter S got blocked, she and N began the weak form of blackmailing to M. They tend to assert that S didn’t have anything like that but M lured her into all this, and the depression of S has gone worse because of this. Finally, M has to unblock S and has to succumb to all her demands.\n\nBy this time, everyone is getting this idea that M and S are in a relationship, and even Ish is quite confident about it. S is using M emotionally, on the account of her depression and continuing to build web around M. M is beginning to lose his mind and getting helpless.\n\n*\\[On a phone call to his friend\\]:*\n\nM: Pal, I’m ruining my life, there is no way I can find a way out.\n\nFriend: What’s the new problem?\n\nM: She is calling me to come to Bh (a fourth city), I swear I shall not go there.\n\nFriend: Indeed, you should not.\n\n\\[But it didn’t turnout like that. M was forced, both by S and N, to meet S in Bh and the reason was still the same: S was feeling alone and vulnerable. Now comes the part which is the point of departure for Law:\n\n**After seeing no option to evade her, M finally agrees to meet S, but not in a hotel or park or something, but at a quarter of his trusted friends. S decided it such that the meeting day was fixed on her birthday. M along with S arrives at the quarter so mentioned. They celebrated her birthday, there were 3 boys other than M in that quarter. After cake was cut and dinner was done, M and S went into a room (within that quarter), all alone and no one knows what happened in there, yet everyone knows no reproductive act took place. Both of them were above 18.**\\]\n\n————————————————————--------------------------------------------\n\nAll these events took place in the period 2019-21. And slowly S herself got out of M’s life. But as it is the case with almost every other creature, humans take a strange pleasure in persecuting, though they never call it a persecution, a weaker type of their race, this pleasure of defying God and persecuting the innermost strings of His creation is ubiquitous and indeed eternal. In 2022, S came to resurface in M’s life and with same dominance began to coerce him into healing her.\n\nNow it is 2024, and M is quite out of touch from her for approximately 2 years, but this N, who broke up with Ish, is still in contact with M, and sometimes blame M for teaching her love when she should have focused on her studies. N is not very good to M and can anytime evoke S into M’s life.\n\nI request you all to please provide your legal as well as general advice on this issue. My primary concern is, what are the ways in which S can torment M by misusing the laws? And how can we protect M?",

While I am here, I do feed a female dog and have been since past 3 years. She recently gave birth to 6 puppies. The campus often gets a dog catcher to catch all stray dogs and relocate them outside the campus because of the complaints given by the professors itself or students. I have fought for my dog to be back with me and they complied. Now after I leave I’m afraid they’ll move my dog and her puppies away from the campus. She’s a sweet girl who is afraid of men but is okay once she sniffs them. I don’t know why people want the dog gone from their sight.",

We are at a loss as to why he did this. To give some details \nThe guy works in a reputed company in US. \nHe and my sister got engaged in November of last year. We have proof of the event, pictures etc. We have the wedding card etc as proof too. Not sure what can be done here and what proofs are needed for this. \nPlease advise. \nThank you \n\nPS:\n\nFolks, I don’t want to file any false case against him. He didn’t ask for dowry, and I wouldn’t do that. But yes, there is trauma he has caused us by the way he has handled things. And I wanted him to understand that what he did is not right. \nBacking out is fine as long as it doesn’t come at a huge cost financial, emotional. I have spent close to 10L for the wedding prep. They wanted a grand engagement and we obliged. Sangeeth, done. Clothes to be given. Big wedding hall, done. No expenses were split. \n\nWe are all humans after all and playing with people’s emotions is not right. Which is what this post is for.

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI recently moved to the Dhanori area near Pune Airport in July, and I’m facing a significant issue with the noise from Indian Air Force (IAF) jets. Initially, there were only 2-3 take-offs a day, which were already quite loud, but now it’s escalated to 10-15 jets flying, taking off, and landing three times a day. This usually happens in the mornings around 8:30-9:00 AM (just as we’re waking up), again around lunch (12:00 PM), and late at night (10:00-10:30 PM) when we’re trying to sleep. The noise is so loud it’s unbearable, and it’s impacting daily life.\n\nI understand that military operations might be involved, but I’m curious if this is normal for residential areas near airports. My main concern is about our legal rights as residents.\n\n\t1.\tIs there a way to formally complain about this?\n\t2.\tAre there any noise regulations or protections for residents in such situations?\n\t3.\tWhom should I approach, and what steps can I take to address this?\n\t4.\tHas anyone else dealt with similar situations near military or civilian airports?\n\nI’m hoping to get some guidance on how to approach this from a legal standpoint, or at least some insight into whether this kind of noise disturbance is something we just have to live with.\n\nLooking forward to any advice or experiences you can share!\n\nThanks in advance!",

I paid the bill the same day, but they still haven’t returned the fuse.\n\nWhen I raised a complaint, they had the audacity to call me today and tell I’d have to go to their office, show proof of payment, and only then would they give the fuse back.\n\nIsn’t the fuse technically my property? If so, doesn’t taking it like this count as theft?\n\nThey also added a penalty in the bill for late payment, so if a penalty was already applied, what’s the justification for physically taking the fuse? \n\nI’m thinking of filing an RTI to get clarity on this, but I’m not sure how to word the question. Also, is it possible to file a police complaint for theft or take this to court for compensation?\n\nthis is the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board btw.\n\nps: my goal isn't getting the fuse back as my dad got a fuse from a nearby store right after the lineman left, so that's not the problem. i just wanna check these out and file some complaints to see how everything works.",

They have a child.\nThe father has not visited the child ever since th child's birth.\nThe mother did not want to give visitation. Asked for 5 lakhs to be deposited for child in FD.\nThe terms were agreed upon by both parties. \n\nBut the lawyers demanded extra money to finalise. P did not have the full amount immediately, and so she asked for sometime for her to gather the amount. About 1 and a half month. They agreed.\n\nNow, the lawyers of both parties have contacted her stating that the father has changed his mind. And now he wants visitation rights.\n\nP doesn't want him anywhere near the child. She is willing to give up the money he has to deposit as well. As long her child doesn't see him.\n\nLawyers are not helping much either. They're telling he can fight for visitation. But all this was already settled upon. They didn't finalise because she didn't have the extra money they demanded.\n\nWhats the best course of action, where she can deny visitation and just get a divorce. Advice please. \n\nSorry if the formatting is bad. I'm on phone.\n\nEdit: Forgot to add, the child is five years old. P had tried to call him to meet the child during the first year. He denied. Later she decided to raise her by herself. And now she wants a divorce. She is WILLING TO LET GO OF the money they settled upon, she doesn't want visitation.",

This placement happened nearly 3 years ago and was one and only such high package placements in college history. You can say our college accidentally got him as a student. They have been milking the crap out of him for last 3 years.\n\nNow currently I am in 4th year of college and in the last 3 years biggest hurdle in my placement prep had been my college. Our college has 75% attendance criteria and college hours 9am-6pm. I didn't get any time to prepare for placements.\n\nIn third year I got a backlog NOT because I didn't study, but because our examiner didn't do fair checking of the papers. Apparently he had a few 'favorite chapters' and if students didn't attempt questions from that chapter he failed them on purpose. Mind you, these favorite chapter only had a combined weightage of 30% of total marks and were too tough to justify only 30% marks. So i did not study them and studied for the other 70%. As expected I failed the exam and got an active backlog for that semester. \n\nAs it was the end of 3rd year, all the major companies with high packages made offers to students and I was not allowed to a single one of them. My blood boils to this date just thinking of the injustice that happened to me.\n\nNow, if I get placed off-campus with a high package, and my college advertises me, can I sue them for false advertisement since I did not learn anything related to placement from college and if anything they only hurt my chances of even better placements?",

        "text": "I am 18M. And although this post might seem cringe and foolish, I swear that only I know the shit I have seen.  \nSo it is my goal to complete my btech(1st year as of now) and flee this country and my father's control ASAP(I am not disrespecting my country so please don't get this post locked or me banned) through either employment or Masters degree and settle in USA or Singapore permanantly(I will deal with the H1B thing)  \nSo, the main thing is that my Father is a VERY clever businessman with a degree in law and financial advisory and tends to use his acumen against his own family. As much as I know him, he wants me to work under him and bend as per his wishes for my whole life. I wanted to go to the USA for my UG itself on a student loan(He is very rich but I don't want to ask him for shit bcuz I know how bad he his in his role of a father). After a week of fights and crying, He convinced me that he will pay full for my master's degree after I do my UG here and that I can obviously do as I please once I get money through a job even if he breaks his word (he is that \"maa-baap ke messages on Whatsapp\" type of guy who tries to play with me emotionally). I knew that he would try to brainwash me with his shit during my 4 years in this country and discourage me from moving out - which he has already started with and tries to bring it up whenever he gets a chance until I call him out.  \nnow, I know how much of a crook he is so I got the assurance in a proper manner on whatsapp and saved the messages with proper screenshots(with deleted number and all that stuff). But I also know that the mesages proof might not work as he will eventually try to find some sort of holes in it. He has already started putting some accounts and positions in his company on my name and regularly asks me to sign papers - it is generally transfer related stuff which I didn't find doubtful.   \nNow, my question is, that can he Bind me legally to remain in this country or with him due to some sort of business  or loan related stuff if he plays with books? How do I avoid that from happening? I can attach the ss for reference.",

If we have kids in future (the kid will get the dad's surname and the kid's passport will have both parents' names, so that should be good enough proof for everything I think)\n\nFor all of the above, is it not enough to have proof of marriage (like a marriage certificate, and maybe even spouse name on passport)? Or do you need to provide additional documents like affidavits or notarize them etc just because surnames are different? I would really appreciate any information. Thank you in advance!",

Personally , I thought we have the same level of free speech that US does , but I got to know I am wrong, so here I want to clarify certain things:\n\n1. Can you as an Indian have a personal opinion which is discriminatory but which you share in informal domain like social media apps ?\n\n(E.g : A lot of people have conservative or 'sexist' opinion about gender. Men and even women  about dressing , manner they talk  and conduct themselves , the ability to provide etc.  Apart from formal environment ,  Now if you talk about it on social media , will that be illegal to provide such an opinion ? )\n\n2. If someone makes a public post on social media , will commenting in trolling or roasting qualify as an harassment ? (Ofc giving threats is illegal and punishable and so is making sexual remarks on an SFW post , but apart from that )\n\nA simple yes or no answer will do , however if you can provide any explanation to NO's it will be helpful. \n\nThanks for reading\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nMy husband and I have been going through marital problems due to finances and my in laws. I also have a 1 year old daughter with whom I have been living in my parent's house for about 3 months now. I personally did not think our issues were very bad, in fact he agreed to that we would live separately from the in laws and made certain promises as well. But since the day before yesterday he has started behaving differently, including calling my family members and complaining about me, sending them private messages we have shared between us and today he recorded our phone call for the first time. I believe he is gathering evidence somehow to gain custody of our child in case things get to a divorce and I think someone in the legal profession is advising him. He is still talking to me as if he wants to reconcile. I need some advice on if I should also search for a legal opinion? \n\nWe both are originally from different states and if I do agree to go with him then I would be essentially with little resources to seek council because I don't speak the native language well. I am also currently not employed because of my daughter bring young and then moving to a different state. I don't know what I should do if he tries to start a legal dispute in his locality. Is there anything i can do to protect my daughter and myself? Thanks",

The FIR is on 10 people but she was posted as senior branch manager and she herself went to surrender to the police as they were pressuring her but then later police has written that they arrested her. Her in-laws had a political background but from the party of SP and the cooperative bank owner is itself a famous leader of SP because of which the matter is highly politically motivated. The party in power will never support it obviously. There are 4 people who are responsible but the other 6 people literally belong to small villages and have very small children. 5 are females. She is even ready ti payback the amount through loans and stuff but it's of no use it seems. \n\nI want to know what should she do now. She claims that she didn't know her I'd was being used all this time for transactions and she could never pay attention as she is not that digitally educated + she feels that other people used her I'd and now she is the one being blamed. In all this matter, she got in a accident and her husband is severely injured as in a severly critical position and she has two children. He was in Medanta gurgaon all this time but now is back in district. The whole family has gone to ruins. I feel so bad for them. The father is staying separately from the children as well since children are not 18+. \n\nWhat should she do now? It's also being said that the investigation officer has put a new dhara 120b on the record with other reasons. She is being crushed into this case so bad. She is in jail and her life will get ruined if in the chargesheet all  these dharas will be there. Meanwhile, she solemnly promises that she never got to know her digital I'd being used wrongly. She's innocent but her crime is being ignorant. What should she do now? Please help. Even the lawyers are not able to help properly. We don't know what to do? \n\nAll of this is happening very politically which is why we are helpless. What should we do? The whole family condition is worse than ever. My heart goes out to them. It's been 2 months now of the FIR being lodged. She was not arrested for some time as we took help of police but then they pressured that surrender or we will file section 82 on her so she did.

        "text": "I don't know guys if you know about this or not but recently i encountered new kind of scam. \n\n\"The Customer Care Scam\" \nYou might have faced issue with the delivery guys right. Sometimes Amazon or Flipkart shows that your item has been delivered but in reality it never reached you. \nYou see this and realise delivery guy is scamming you by keeping that item to himself. In that moment you decide to call the customer care to complaint about your grievances (I have just taken an example of delivery guy, there can be many other instances where you contact customer care)\n\nTill here everything is fine. This next step is very crucial. Sometimes you can find the number to contact customer care in the app itself but majority of times we usually do a simple google search and whichever number comes first we just copy paste in our dialer and call the customer care. \n\nI don't know what kind of algorithm google is following for its searches but the thing is, the number which is on top of the search is not always the genuine number. \n\nOnce you call that number you will hear customer care like talk, it will be very hard for you to distinguish. They will ask you genuine questions like whats your tracking ID(if its an parcel), whats your Name Number and all the usual jargen. \n\nSometimes they send you links so that you file a complaint via that link, sometimes its a WhatsApp msg, sometimes its an Play Store app. Which is making it very hard to trust anything now. \n\nI know many of you consider yourself smart and think it is so obvious how can people fall for this. Even i used to think that but i almost fell for it. At the very last moment i realised this can't be right, something is wrong. This is very dangerous because you are not expecting that customer care will be doing something wrong. \n\nLets say your TV stopped working and you searched sony, samsung etc customer care support and called thay number. Here, you are not expecting that someone is trying to scam you because you were just asking for your TV. Now if they tell you to download an app and file a complaint via that app after filling some details, most likely you will do it. \n\n*SOLUTION*\nSimple solution is that never trust google search. Always go to official site and from there get the customer support number. \n\nAnd you guys are obviously smart enough to know that never share your OTP, say that goes without saying.",

Being a student, this is a huge amount for me! \n\nI immediately called the person, told him about it and asked him to return my money.\nHe told me he doesn’t use paytm anymore (which could be the case since there were no double ticks on Paytm chat), and that he would install it and return my money\n\nI called again to ask if he checked, he said he’s busy and for the next two follow up calls, his reply remained unchanged \n\nSo I called him again and asked me him to return the money ASAP or else i’ll have to file a complaint. He told me he’d check at 8 PM for sure and let me know\n\n8 pm- he doesn’t call. I call him and he’s trying to do something w the SIM to install Paytm(apparently the calls were diverted to his current phone from that SIM). He finally said that it’ll take 3-4 days for him to be able to install Paytm and that he's a “biwi bachcho wala aadmi hun, chori nhi karunga“. (He did sound reliable + he picked my call each and every time)\n\nI’m too anxious now and i’m afraid I sounded as someone who’s easy to fool. How do I deal with this? \n\nEdit: i finally got 2000 Rs. back. It was an utterly frustrating process. Today the Paytm customer care executive called me and he told me that the receiver had used that money 2 days ago (when he told me that he can't make the transfer because kyc nahi hai)\n\nI called this man and he legit tried to scam me - he asked for my a/c number so that he could transfer the amount. I waited for 2 hours and called him up and he asked me to share the OTP so that he could transfer the amount to my account. \n\nAnd call me what you want, I lost my cool and the convo thereon included a lot of cussing. I threatened him that i’ll file a police complaint on grounds of fraud. He immediately transferred 2K via PayTM\n\nThank you everyone! \n\nTLDR: Paytm-ed a wrong person- guy says he doesn't have Paytm on his phone- the calls are diverted from the sim linked with that number- but he would return it in 3-4 days.

        "text": "Note: Most of us have seen The Social Network. This post outlines the importance of a founder's agreement in a startup from the perspective of Mark Zuckerberg (not actually said, written, or endorsed by him). \n\nHey everyone,\n\nI wanted to talk about the importance of a founder's agreement in the early stages of a startup. As many of you may know, my co-founder Eduardo Saverin and I had a falling out in the early days of Facebook, and unfortunately, we didn't have a proper founder's agreement in place. This ultimately led to a legal battle and a lot of wasted time, energy, and resources.\n\nA founder's agreement is a legal document that outlines the rights, responsibilities, and expectations of each founding member of a startup. It's crucial to have this in place from the very beginning, as it sets the foundation for how the business will operate and how disputes will be resolved.\n\nSome key components of a founder's agreement include:\n\n* Ownership percentages: This outlines how much of the company each founder owns, and how that percentage may change over time.\n* Decision-making processes: This outlines how important decisions will be made within the company, and how disagreements will be resolved.\n* Vesting schedule: This outlines how and when founders will vest their shares in the company.\n* Exit strategy: This outlines what will happen if a founder leaves the company, whether it's voluntarily or involuntarily.\n\nI can't stress enough how important it is to have these things spelled out from the beginning. Trust me, you don't want to be in a position where you're fighting with your co-founder(s) over something that could have been avoided with a proper agreement. It's not worth it.\n\nSo, to all the startup founders out there, please take the time to put a founder's agreement in place. It may not be the most exciting thing to do, but it could save you a lot of headaches down the road.\n\nMark Zuckerberg",

And if someone from outside of India were to send us some cryptocurrency whether receiving such cryptos would come under the classification of \"Import of software\" and be liable to GST accordingly?

A few details which have came to light are as follows- \n\n1) dad(married) had promised to marry(married) the other woman and they were in a sexual relationship. Could this be used as pretext to file a rape case?\n\n2) dad had pushed for that woman to divorce because her drunk husband used to beat her up and told her that he would take care of her. Divorce was filed and one hearing is already done.\n\n3) he, wait for it, actually did marry the other woman in a temple. But I think according to Hindu act that married is null and void since they both were already married.\n\n4) she was buying a property in the city we live so that later on he could meet her there. The house was registered in her name but the loan hasn't been sanctioned yet. My suggestion to him was that we should mail her the registry papers and let her take the decision.\n\nInitially we were thinking of mailing the builders that we don't want to purchase the house since loan isn't being sanctioned, as dad has her email id and used to take care of paperwork. In case the money initial Money paid isn't returned by the builders, we would transfer the money to her bank account so that she doesn't suffer. But then someone suggested me against doing that as acting on her behalf and then sending money to her account could both land us in trouble. \nPS. The property is in her name and dad has nothing to do with it other than searching for it and doing the paperwork. He was gonna pay for it indirectly but she is financially incapable of doing so. \n\nWould any of the first three points get him into legal trouble?\nI would really really appreciate some help. Dad turns out is as smart as a door knob but he's family. \n\nThank you kind folks.",

        "text": "This happened in January. I was in a relationship with a girl for 6 months from april 2021 January 2022. Things were not going anywhere, i was not happy in the relationship. She wouldn’t give me time of the day, would roam around with her friends doing parties in clubs and parties and what not. This went on like this ever since our relationship started. I was very clear from the beginning. But she lied again and again, went to goa with 5 guys and one girl. God knows what happened there. On asking even little things she would blame me for everything on how i won’t let her go out with her friends. That’s when i lost my mind and started thinking with my dick. Met a girl through a common friend and hooked up with her. It was one time. Now the thing is my girlfriend found out and as you can except she was mad af but didn’t break up with me because she said she couldn’t live without me blah blah. Later the girl i hooked up with found out i was in a relationship and she was threatening to tell my girlfriend but I wasn’t worried about that because i already told her what had happened. One month goes by and my girlfriend says the girl is blackmailing her because i had sex with her. It was all mutual I didn’t force her. She says i cheated her and asking for money or else she will file a police complaint. I said let me talk to her but my girlfriend won’t let me talk to her, she threatens that if a text her only once she will commit suicide and what not so I don’t call her. Couple of days go by and my gf tells me that the girl is demanding 2 lakhs rupees. I said I don’t have money let her do whatever she wants I’ll handle her. But she then tells me that she already gave her 1 lakh rupees now she won’t disturb us. Some days go by and again my gf says she is asking for 10k 15k. I said give me proof that she is asking or let me meet her. If she wanted to blackmail she would’ve called me or texted me why would she blackmail my gf. So i gave her total of 50k and she said she won’t disturb us. Since then my gf hasn’t mentioned. Now things have gotten worse she is again behaving the same way. Going out with friends wouldn’t talk to me, ignore me for days. Both our families know about us. Whenever i tell her that I can’t live like this. My family won’t accept you like this. Importantly i won’t accept you like this. It’s not working for me. I want breakup. Everytime i want to talk to her about anything she threatens that she will tell my family and she will sue me because of that girl. Now can she file a case on me because i cheated on her? And i think that she made that whole thing up of blackmail. I don’t think that girl has blackmailed. She got the money and after i gave her 50k she was out for like 4 days straight with friends. I’m really suspicious and have no proof of anything. I can’t straight out call that girl. And can she file a case on me because i cheated on her even though we’re not married. I’ve texts of us getting physical mutually so I don’t think she will file a rape case against me. “She threatened it” she said if i broke up with her she will tell police that i used her for sex, even thought we have had sex only twice in 6-8 months. Please tell me what can i do",

        "text": "About Me :- 22yr old M college student working as an intern.\n\nBackground of question :- So I live in India and recently I have seen many divorce cases where men are forced into situations so dire that some of them have ended their life from it. So it all boils down to money their wife and her family is asking for child support and many different types of expenses plus the major one SPLITTING THE WEALTH EVENLY like there was a case in which the couple was married for a month only and now the husband has to split all he has earned equally with her wife, plus the laws here are heavily favoured towards women they can randomly make many serious allegations against us but that is a different ball game.\n\nWHAT I AM SEEKING? So I have thought of something like making a trust which is based in another country whichever is most suitable for me the trust will own everything I have and in future whatever wealth I am generating it will be in the name of trust.\n\nNow here comes my idea which I don't know if it's legally possible or not So there will be a commitee which will have full rights to decide how to use the resources of the trust in that committee there will be three members me, my mom and dad and few others if there is someone. Now every person will have a vote percentage value and to decide on something you have to get at least 60% vote. So after setting this up I will give my self a vote percentage value of 80% my mom and dad 9% simultaneously and the remaining 2% will be distributed among any other members if they are in the committee.\n\nSo now suppose I am in court and they ask me to split something or even give any expenses then here is my response \"\" I DON'T HAVE A SINGLE PENNY IN MY NAME NOR DO I EARN ANYTHING™ all I have is a voting right for a trust who has resources to move so does this work.\n\nOr any other solution for my issue I would literally be very grateful for your advice",

        "text": "Marriage Timeline:\n\nThe couple met in September 2022, got engaged in November 2022, and married in February 2023.\n\nThe marriage was never consummated due to the husband’s lack of interest.\n\nThey lived together from March to May 2023 and again from November to December 2023. They were separated from January 2024 onward.\n\n\nKey Issues in the Marriage:\n\n1. Deception:\n\nThe husband claimed to have ended contact with a female friend but secretly maintained the relationship. Evidence includes the presence of her profile on his Netflix account as late as September 2023.\n\n\n\n2. Physical and Emotional Abuse:\n\nThe husband physically assaulted the wife twice, including strangulation.\n\nHe threatened suicide during conflicts and left notes blaming her for his actions.\n\nThe wife lost her phone a week after the assault but retains WhatsApp messages and an audio recording of the husband threatening suicide.\n\n\n\n3. Lack of Intimacy:\n\nAlthough the wife had vaginismus, she consulted a doctor who confirmed it was treatable and only required using a lubricant. Despite this, the husband showed no willingness to attempt intimacy, causing significant emotional distress.\n\n\n\n4. Family Interference:\n\nThe husband’s mother and sister frequently interfered in the couple’s personal matters, adding stress and strain to the relationship.\n\n\n\n5. Wife’s Emotional Reaction:\n\nAt one point, the wife threatened suicide to help the husband understand how frightening and serious his behavior felt.\n\n\n\n\nImpact on the Wife:\n\nShe left her job and relocated to support the marriage.\n\nAfter separation, she had to rebuild her life and career, which caused emotional and professional setbacks.\n\n\nFinancial Stance:\n\nThe wife does not seek alimony or a financial settlement.\n\nShe only requests the return of the gold and silver gifted by her father to her husband, valued at approximately ₹10 lakh.",

        "title": "Owner asking us to vacate immediately ",
        "text": "We three girls share a flat in a residential semi-gated society in Hyderabad. Found this place on flats and flatmates. The owner stays in Canada. At the time I got the place, I was not told that male friends were not allowed or anything as such. The only thing that was told was to not disturb anyone else in the society. My male friend used to come and sometimes stay over the weekend. Our maid who also resides in the building and is the mother-in-law of the caretaker, told the president that a guy has been staying in the house for 3 months which was not true in any way. I talked to the owner and cleared out that he does not stay here and only visits as he is my only relative here ( I panicked and lied that he is a cousin). \n\nNow we told that maid not to come anymore as she was bitching about us and she also didn't do the housework properly. Since then the caretaker's family has been mad at us and anytime any guy comes over he goes and complains to the president. Even then sometimes my friend was staying the night on weekends. But then our owner asked to vacate stating that too many irrelevant boys were coming which was never the case. At least from my side, only my friend was coming. And a couple of guy friends of another girl come by. We reasoned it out with the owner as well as the president that no guy will stay the night over but you cannot stop anyone from coming to our house. We live in a different city alone, you can't expect us to stay locked in our houses. Both of them agreed that people (even boys) can come and go as long as they don't spend the night and we have it on a WhatsApp conversation as well. \n\nNow today I went with my friend for breakfast. We came back home at around 10 in the morning and this caretaker came out of the lift and asked my friend in Telugu to go stating no boys are allowed in a girl's flat. I told them that we had arrays talked to the president repeatedly but he was not budging. (Quick fact: The caretaker speaks only Telugu and I do not know Telugu but my friend does)\n\nHe took us to the president and it was a different person. Apparently, there are a couple of presidents in the society. I told him that we already had a talk but he was too rude and said \"What I say is final, I am the main president and boys are not allowed, you go\". They were not even listening to me and started speaking in Telugu which I don't understand. I then called up the person whom we had a conversation with (president no 2) and he said that we did have a conversation but you people are not following our conditions and hence no males are allowed. This is their new rule. I assured him that we were, to which he said that he had seen in the CCTV camera that you girls were coming down and taking the guys up. Which no one did and how does it matter as long as we are abiding by their rule to not let any guy stay over. Meanwhile, that caretaker who picks up garbage dares to drag my friend's hand and tell him to leave or else he will call the police. He is basically trying to take revenge as we let the maid go. We were very polite with them but they were shouting and threatening as if we did something wrong. My friend left and now the owner is asking me to vacate the place immediately. \n\nWe have an agreement till November and the owner has our two-month deposit. Also, nowhere was it mentioned that boys cannot come. They are making up new rules every day and this is just for our flat as we are the only bachelors living in the building. I also need to mention that most of the time we are not home and are in our offices or out. Neither have we had any parties in the house or loud noise nor has anyone ever created a ruckus. \n\nI don't know what to do now or where to go. Please advise. And so sorry for the long post. \n\nUpdate: Firstly thank you so much for your response and support guys. I really appreciate each of you putting your opinions and suggestions on the table. The owner is cutting my calls and just texted me to vacate the place immediately. I told him that I will vacate in a few days after you return my security deposit. He has not replied since. However, he called both the other flatmates and told them to ask ME and just me to vacate the house immediately as the president complained against me after the altercation. He said he will not return the security money as I have broken rules and will only return it if all three of us together vacate the house. \n\nAs of now, I am still put up at the place for now, and if someone forces me to vacate on an immediate basis, I am ready to call the police. I myself do not want to stay in a place owned and controlled by people with such a regressive mentality but I don't think asking a female to vacate overnight is right on their part. I am actively looking for houses and am ready to vacate as soon as I find another place however, I want my security deposit back. And him not agreeing to give me my money when he is the one asking me to leave is just so wrong on so many levels. Also, I have noticed that he is avoiding the conversation with me either on WhatsApp or on a call as I think he also knows that he is wrong. And if he tells me the same on a call or over text, I might have evidence of the same which may put him in trouble. \n\n\nI would also like to state that I try my best to be a very reasonable person and till the time my owner asked me to vacate on immediate basis without returning my security deposit, I had full empathy for him. However, what is wrong is just wrong. If they would have told me beforehand that boys are not allowed I would never let my male friend come over. I was told that we could do anything as long as we are not disturbing the neighbours. I am a low-key person who does not like to invite unnecessary trouble. When these problems about him coming over arose, both the president and the owner said that male friends can come over but not stay overnight. Had they told then itself that males are not allowed now, I would have said okay and quietly left the place in a few months. However my other flatmate repeatedly asked them for clarification as to what is allowed and prohibited and they themselves said that males can come. Only after that my friend has come. Now they are saying that I have not followed their rules as male friends should stay for 1-2 hours only. If so, they should have told me before. He travels almost 2-3 hours and comes from 35 kms away to meet me and it is very difficult to come and go for 1 hour. We would have met outside or somewhere. My point being that just be transparent about the rules. Why are they making up new rule every other week and harrassing us? ",

He doesn't live with his parents in Delhi, but in Chandigarh, mainly because of his job. \n\nHe'd spent his childhood in Delhi but moved to Chandigarh due to his job. Apparently, no Delhi girl wanted to marry him and move away. \n\nSo the woman he got married to is from a town in Haryana. The family was told she's done her master's in mathematics. My cousin has a decent paying job, enough for the both of them but the family obviously motivates women to be independent.\n\nThey had a long engagement but anytime my cousin or his parents would call (on Diwali, etc) to greet the girl, her mother would say she's busy studying, or she's in the library, etc.\n\nCut to straight after the wedding and this girl doesn't know anything about maths. She has no employment prospects and basically said that she just wants to be a housewife.\n\nThe family was, umm, fine with her decision, empowering women also means appreciating her decision but my cousin is facing money problems because she likes to spend a lot of his money on clothes, salon, etc.\n\nFurthermore, since my cousin and his wife don't love with his parents and my cousin goes to work at 8am, she has the house all to herself. \n\nLast time we visited, the kitchen was smelling of rotten food, anta crawling everywhere, the washroom were the worst. All of this when there's a maid to help. \n\n4-5 days of the week she says she has back pain or head pain and asks my cousin to swiggy or Zomato food instead of cooking anything herself.\n\nOn her recent visit to her cousin's parents' house, she refused to touch the elders' feet or even say namasté. She stayed in her room and refused to come out.\n\nMy Taiji (Aunt) is very forgiving so she didn't make a big deal of her transgressions but this girl doesn't step into the kitchen and let her mother-in-law do all the house work.\n\nWhen my Tauji talked to the girl's parents, they kept saying \"oh, it must be a misunderstanding, our daughter isn't like this\" and they always find excuses but never apologize.\n\nOne night, my cousin found her talking to a guy on call at 3am. She keeps deleting her WhatsApp chats, yet confessed that she had hacked my cousin's phone to check if he's having an affair.\n\nMy cousin and the family is frustrated at her and her family's behaviour and now she has gone to her parents' home and said that she's gonna stay there for a month.\n\nMy cousin and his parents wanted to talk to her family to check what's wrong but they said she's mad at the cousin because of something he said (but isn't telling anybody what it was). When they said we'll come to talk to her, her parents said we'll not be home when you come.\n\nMy cousin also complains that she is always stuck to her phone, and whenever he tries to do anything romantic, she avoids him and neglects him in general.\n\nOkay, turns out it is a long post. But my cousin and the family doesn't know how to deal with this mess.\n\nAny fruitful advice or help will be highly appreciated.\n\nTl;dr My cousin had an arranged marriage, the girl doesn't want to work (at home or outside) and doesn't want to treat the family with any respect.",

        "text": "A week ago, on my visit to Delhi, I (28F) booked a room for two nights in Bloomrooms @ New Delhi Railway. I chose this property because it has received awards for its quality service and because they have a reputation for being clean. Friends also had good things to say about this. \n\nI checked in late evening and everything felt nice. Most rooms on my floor were empty except one or two.. which I didn't think was much of a concern. The next morning, I had just been awoken by a phone call at 10.30 am, when the housekeeping used their master-key to open and enter my room. According to him, he had been around earlier and knocked a few times, but because nobody had replied, he had used the key. He left the room -- didn't see him after that. \n\nI decided to speak to the receptionist. The girls there were no help -- they only listened to me mutely. I asked them to call the Manager. He came, heard me but started making excuses and trying to tell me all the ways it was my fault. I should have responded when the housekeeping knocked, I should have put the DnD card on my door if I didn't want to be disturbed. I told him I was asleep. Also told him disturbing me and entering my room were two completely different things. I asked him why didn't the housekeeping know that the room was occupied and why didn't they use the phone first to check. He kept saying this was an understandable mistake, the receptionists said that while room-cleaning this happens sometimes. I became hysterical at this point because it was upsetting to me that only I thought this was a serious issue. The manager then told me that he would be noting my suggestions -- and then he asked me if I still wanted my room cleaned. As if that was the most important point of the discussion we were having. \n\nI stepped out of there to clear my head and after calming down, decided that the best step was to check out and move to a different hotel. Sadly, I had to face a different receptionist. Later I realised that he was being nice and polite because there was this foreign group checking in at that time. He persuaded me to share why I was cutting my stay short. Ngl, I thought maybe he would listen and do something so I told him what happened. But he took the same approach and used almost the same excuses as the manager, which made me realise that I should have just stayed quiet and left. \n\nOnce I was back home, I dropped an email to them which has gone unresponded, and I have dropped a follow-up reminder as well. \n\nWhat can I do to get action taken against this? I plan to drop public reviews and maybe write a note to the CEO on LinkedIn. But I don't believe I am going to be taken seriously. Do I have any effective ways to bring attention or complaint about this? ",

        "title": "Mutual Divorce vs. Contested Divorce - What You Need to Know",
        "text": "Divorce is a big step, and it often comes with many emotions and challenges. If you’re considering divorce, understanding how the process works is essential. Here’s a breakdown of the two main types of divorce: mutual and contested.\n\n# What is Divorce?\n\nDivorce means legally ending a marriage. It’s not just about separating; it involves several important issues:\n\n1. **Division of Property**: How will you split belongings and debts?\n2. **Child Custody and Support**: Where will your children live, and how will their needs be financially supported?\n3. **Spousal Support**: Will one partner pay money to the other after the divorce?\n\nThese issues are key in deciding whether to go for a mutual or contested divorce.\n\n# Mutual Divorce: A Team Effort\n\nA **mutual divorce** happens when both spouses agree to end their marriage. This cooperative approach usually makes the process smoother and faster.\n\n**Key Steps in a Mutual Divorce**:\n\n* **Agreement on Terms**: Both partners agree on matters like property division, child custody, and support.\n* **Filing a Joint Petition**: The couple submits a joint petition to the court, explaining their agreement.\n* **Cooling-Off Period**: Many places require a waiting period before the final hearing, giving couples time to reflect.\n* **Final Hearing**: A judge reviews the case, and if everything looks good, they grant the divorce.\n\n# Legal Help for Mutual Divorce\n\nIn a mutual divorce, you can meet with a lawyer together or separately. The lawyer will explain the process, help gather documents, and prepare the joint petition. Since both parties usually cooperate, there’s minimal follow-up needed.\n\n# Benefits of Mutual Divorce\n\n* **Speed**: Typically takes about six months to a year, faster than contested divorces.\n* **Cost-Effective**: Less legal work means lower costs.\n* **Reduced Conflict**: Less emotional stress since both agree on terms.\n\n# Contested Divorce: A Different Journey\n\nA **contested divorce** happens when one spouse wants a divorce, but the other does not, or when they can’t agree on key issues. This process is usually more complicated and can take much longer.\n\n**Steps Involved in a Contested Divorce**:\n\n* **Filing a Petition**: One spouse files a divorce petition with the court, stating reasons for the divorce.\n* **Response from the Other Spouse**: The other spouse can agree or disagree with the petition.\n* **Discovery Phase**: Both sides gather information, including financial documents and evidence.\n* **Negotiation and Mediation**: Courts often suggest mediation to help settle disagreements without going to trial.\n* **Trial**: If mediation doesn’t work, a judge makes decisions on disputed issues.\n\n# Legal Help for Contested Divorce\n\nIn a contested divorce, one spouse typically seeks legal help. The lawyer discusses the reasons for the divorce and prepares for possible disputes. This includes gathering detailed information about the marriage and any supporting evidence.\n\n# Challenges of Contested Divorce\n\n* **Lengthy Process**: Can take many months or even years to resolve.\n* **Higher Costs**: More legal work means it can get expensive.\n* **Increased Stress**: The confrontational nature can add emotional strain.\n\n# Key Differences Between Mutual and Contested Divorce\n\n* **Approach**: Mutual divorce is collaborative; contested divorce is confrontational.\n* **Legal Help**: In mutual divorces, lawyers focus on friendly resolutions; in contested divorces, they prepare for legal battles.\n* **Documentation**: Mutual divorces need simpler paperwork; contested divorces require detailed documentation.\n* **Follow-Up**: Mutual divorces have minimal follow-up, while contested divorces need frequent check-ins.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding the differences between mutual and contested divorce can help you make informed choices. While a mutual divorce is usually faster and less stressful, a contested divorce might be necessary if there are disagreements.\n\nIf you’re considering a divorce, getting help from a legal expert can protect your rights and guide you through the process.\n\nAt Zolvit, we know divorce can be tough. Our team is ready to provide tailored guidance for your situation. Whether you’re leaning toward a mutual or contested divorce, we’re here to help you make the best decisions for your future.

        "text": "To start with I should add I’m a woman and a feminist. I think India has deep rooted patriarchal issues that plague the social structure today. However the recent uptick in fake dowry cases bothers me.\n\nDowry law has become more of an extortion weapon for ugly divorces vs protection against actual harassment. It is sad that women who need help in real dowry cases probably don’t even have the means to use the law themselves. Given how little legal recourse men have in a fake dowry case, should legal agreements where both parties confirm there was no exchange of dowry be normalized during weddings? \n\nIndia is a very conservative country and things like money are not talked about even in regular day to day conversations. So this is in no way an easy conversation. It brings up tricky things like trust. But I believe legal agreements like these are practical and families should prioritize practical things in the long run vs “4 log Kya kahenge”\n\none - would something like this work in courts and solve the fake dowry misuse?\nMen on this Reddit - why aren’t we already doing this?\nWomen would you be open to initiating this discussion with your partners?\n\nLooking for a realistic discussion around a potential solution. This post is not meant to pit one gender against another or vent frustrations around the current situation. How do we move forward?",

        "text": "This is a story of a close family friend of mine. Her husband and in laws are really toxic and greedy. They wouldn’t let her talk to her own parents. One time they found a mobile with her and the husband threw the phone and broke it. She started communicating with her family using her laptop. The husband found it and broke that too.\nShe was a working professional before marriage but after marriage she just spent all time at home doing all the chores. Now she has a 2 year old baby. Husband on the other hand is quite active in dating apps. He has other girlfriends and enjoying the bachelor life. \n\nAbout a year ago she fought with her in laws and came back to her parent’s place. Her parents supported her and she started working while the parents took care of the baby. She wanted her husband and in laws to realise their mistake and to  call her back. She would then negotiate to let her keep working. That didn’t happen. Husband has sent legal notices to her with absurd conditions like her parents should apologise and she would never talk to them. Is such a notice even enforceable? Now he is asking her to divorce him. She has also mentioned about domestic abuse during marriage. Everyone is suggesting her to file an official complaint but she is too scared. Deep inside I think she wants to go back to her husband but the husband is trying to intimidate her. She says she will give divorce if he wants and doesn’t need any alimony or maintenance from him. People are trying to convince her to file a complaint so that she gets maintenance for the child but she is really scared. \n\nI don’t know how to approach this problem. She isn’t thinking about the future of the child or hers. Can you simply divorce someone by signing a document? They have been staying separately for almost a year. Husband has given another ultimatum to come and sign the document. \n\n",

After that as usual the short videos were compiled into a video and sent to me and they threatened me with dire consequences. I ended up paying over Rs 180-200K to them. These consisted of\n\n1) UPI/Scanner payments from multiple UPI IDs and scanners\n\n2) International transfers using my credit card- Around 500 EUR\n\n3) When my accounts were blocked for 24 hours due to excessive funds being transferred I had to ask a friend to pay to a UPI ID and I transferred the amount to his bank.\n\nYes, do feel free to curse and abuse but also do share some useful tips on how to tackle the situation. Even recently they called me and asked for 30K as a \"refundable option\". When I said I would make drastic decisions as I don't really have any other money, he said to send half the amount (15K). I then blocked them all together, thanks to Reddit posts like these I had already deactivated or deleted my socials but the timing was a bit late and I could have saved some money before.\n\nI have some questions-\n\n1) Does the anonymous cybersecurity complaint really help? Does the detailed one help wherein you have to enter all the details- I really don't want to share those with them, I can probably live with the money spent that is as good as gone.\n\n2) Can I claim chargeback for my credit card amount and also can I mask the reason as generic wire fraud? Because for that I need to raise a cybersecurity complaint and again as stated above I don't want to divulge the information. Please help!!! Also the calls have reduced now (touchwood) but I am in constant panic.\n\nUpdate- The chargeback thingy must have worked because they called me yesterday evening and WhatsAppd me saying I have complained to the bank and now they are going to send the girl in the video along with the video over to the police.\n\nUpdate2- I have spoken with the bank and they have assigned temporary credit for now. The final decision might be for or against me. Have not received any calls or messages since today morning. ",

Her mother has always been physically abusive. When my friend was just five years old, she was excited to see her birthday gift early, but her mother became enraged and repeatedly hit her with the gift until she was bleeding—others had to intervene to stop her. Even now, at 17, my friend faces regular physical violence. She was once choked simply for asking her mother to lower the volume on her phone while she was studying.\n\nWhat makes this even more concerning is that her mother did not grow up in an abusive household, meaning this behavior isn't the result of a cycle of generational trauma. Her father and grandmother feel deeply saddened by what she goes through and try to support her, but her mother dominates the entire household, leaving them powerless to intervene.\n\nMy friend feels helpless and doesn’t know where to turn. I want to help her, but I’m not sure what the best course of action is. If anyone has experience dealing with situations like this—Can you please advice her on how to deal with this.

        "text": "**I'm a 20-year-old male. I drove my friend's bike to the bus authority to get my pass renewed, as there is little to no transport services in that area due to 26 jan's prep but was caught and fined midway because I didn't have a license or helmet with me.**\n\n**Yesterday, during college hours, one of my friends reminded me that my student bus pass was expiring, and I needed to get it renewed along with them. The bus office is approximately 1 to 1.5 km from the college, so I asked my Sikh friend for his bike. He knew that I didn't have a license, but since he lives in the area, he had never noticed traffic police there. Being Sikh, he didn't carry a helmet because of his turban.**\n\n**I went to the office and got my pass renewed, but on my way back, two traffic officers (a man and a woman) jumped in front of me and asked me to pull over to the side. When they asked about my license, I lied and said I had forgotten it at the college. The female officer asked for my Aadhaar card to issue the challan. She sarcastically asked me to bring my license to the court, hinting that she knew I didn't have one. Being my first encounter with the police, I got scared about what would happen to his bike and other consequences.**\n\n**I had already paid for the bus pass and didn't have enough cash on me to try to bribe either officer, nor did I have the courage to do so, as they could have filed another charge for attempting to bribe them.**\n\n**Now, the problem is that I come from a lower middle-class background. The challan slip she gave me has the fine amount as 0 rupees, and it states that I'll find out the amount in the virtual court. After searching online, I calculated the amount to be around ₹6000 (₹5000 for the license and ₹1000 for the helmet). To be honest, I don't have that kind of money right now and can't ask my parents, as they are already struggling.**\n\n**Is there any way I can deter or de-escalate the situation, so I have to pay a minimal fine and avoid going to jail? I'm afraid that if I were to be produced before the court, they might book me for driving without a license. Help me figure out my options.**",

        "text": "Hi everyone,\nI’m a 25-year-old male international student in Hyderabad. Last Saturday, I took my ASUS A15 laptop (only 11 months old) to a repair shop in Secunderabad. Since I bought the laptop in Saudi Arabia and its warranty isn’t valid in India, I couldn’t go to the customer service center. Instead, I went to this shop recommended by a friend, as I only needed the thermal paste replaced.\n\nThe shop agreed to do the job for ₹1,000 (even though others charge ₹600). I agreed and told them to ensure the work was done properly. They completed the job, reassembled the laptop, and gave it back to me. However, when I restarted the device, there was no display. I immediately returned it and asked them to check. They said it was late and asked me to come back on Monday. I refused to leave without a receipt and had them document the problem, stating that I hadn’t taken the laptop out of the store.\n\nOn Monday, they told me they had sent the laptop to a \"good repair guy\" who needed more time. When I asked if they trusted this person, they assured me they did. The next day, they still didn’t know what the issue was. When I asked to see my laptop, I found that some screws were missing, and the keyboard backlight wasn’t working. At this point, I was furious and told them to stop working on it.\n\nSince it was Bhogi, most other repair shops were closed. The next day, I went to a reputed shop, ensuring one of the original shop staff carried the laptop to avoid any blame on me. The new shop examined the laptop and informed me of two possibilities:\n\n1. The monitor cable might be the issue (fixable).\n\n\n2. The motherboard could be damaged, making the device practically dead.\n\n\n\nNow, I’m unsure how to proceed. If I go to the police, what would they do, and what would the process look like?\n",

        "text": "I wanted to share a recent case we handled that might help some of you understand the mortgage process better, especially if you’re dealing with missing documents or legal challenges. The client came to us with a property that they wanted to mortgage, but they were facing several hurdles along the way.\n\n# Situation\n\nThis particular client owned a property that had been in the family for decades. The property had been built by the client's parents, and while the family had always taken care of it, there was no formal sale deed. This made the mortgage process much more complicated, as most banks require a registered sale deed to verify ownership. On top of that, the property didn’t have a Completion Certificate (CC) or Occupancy Certificate (OC), which further delayed the process.\n\n# Challenges\n\n1. **No Sale Deed**: Since the property was passed down through the family, there wasn’t a traditional sale deed. The client had a title deed and land purchase documents but nothing that banks typically expect for formal ownership verification.\n2. **Missing Municipal Approvals**: The property didn’t have the required CC or OC, which many banks use to verify if the property is legally fit for use. Without these, securing a loan could have been a huge challenge.\n3. **Encumbrance Issues**: While the property was free from any significant disputes, the client still had to clear up some minor issues with unpaid dues from several years ago.\n\n# Solution\n\nAt this point, the client turned to us for help. Here’s how we tackled the challenges step by step:\n\n1. **Resolving the Missing Sale Deed**: We worked with the client to gather alternative documents that proved ownership, like the title deed and land purchase documents. Additionally, we helped draft an affidavit explaining the property’s history, which was accepted by the bank.\n2. **Obtaining the Missing Approvals**: We guided the client through the process of applying for retrospective approvals from the local municipal authority. After some back-and-forth, we successfully obtained the required Completion and Occupancy Certificates.\n3. **Clearing Encumbrances**: We helped the client settle the outstanding dues and ensured that the property’s legal status was clear. We also secured an updated Encumbrance Certificate (EC) that showed the property was free from any legal disputes.\n\n# How Zolvit Helped\n\nThroughout the process, we supported the client with the following:\n\n* **Document Collection and Verification**: We helped them gather all the necessary documents, including affidavits and legal confirmations, making sure everything met the bank’s requirements.\n* **Legal Representation**: Our legal team took care of the ownership issues and worked closely with the municipal authorities to secure the required approvals.\n* **Expert Guidance**: We helped the client navigate the bank’s specific requirements and explained the process step by step, ensuring that everything was in order.\n\n# Result\n\nIn the end, the client was able to successfully secure a mortgage loan with all the missing documents and legal hurdles addressed. It was a smooth process once we sorted out the paperwork and legalities, and the client could proceed with their plans without further delays.\n\nIf you’re in a similar situation or facing obstacles with mortgaging your property, Zolvit can help you with expert guidance, legal support, and assistance with all the documentation. Don’t let missing documents or legal challenges stop you—reach out to us today, and we’ll make the mortgage process easier for you!",

The entire project had to be stopped as the product was flawed from the start, and I had to send the t-shirts back.\n\nThe manufacturer tried twice to provide samples to fix the issue, but each time, the flaw persisted. Due to this, I incurred a lot of losses from the photoshoot, website setup, and marketing work I’d already invested in, all of which now can't be used.\n\nI requested a full refund due to the unusable product and resulting financial loss, but the manufacturer has refused. Instead, they’ve offered to make other products using the credits.\n\nI’m now wondering if I have a legal right to demand a full refund. Given that the manufacturer was unable to deliver a quality product as promised, am I entitled to a complete refund? Any guidance on what my options are, or if this could be a small claims issue, would be hugely appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "text": "**Greed got the better of me, and I fell for a scam / fraud. I let someone use my credit card in exchange for a small monthly return.**\n\nHere’s a brief summary of what happened (I can share more details if needed in DMs). I’d appreciate any advice or suggestions on how to proceed.\n\nThis started about two years ago, in September 2022. Two individuals were using other people's credit cards, promising them a percentage of the profits in return. They spread the word through pitches and referrals. By October 2023, I got introduced to this scheme through the same network. The pitch was that these guys were buying electronics at steep discounts and reselling them, offering part of the profit to cardholders.\n\nOne of the guys worked for a well-known electronics retailer and claimed his upper management gave him special discount coupons, allowing him to buy at huge discounts. Over time, he even gifted phones to people who let him use multiple cards. Some people also gave him cash. Everything seemed to be going well for months—he’d pay commissions on time and cover card dues before the deadlines, only to reuse the cards afterward.\n\nThings started falling apart in April 2024. He said he was facing issues selling off stock and promised he’d return all the money soon. By June/July, he started offering us stock instead of cash to recover our losses. But this dragged on, and after we threatened legal action, he showed us forged documents of his inventory and transport bills that his stock was on way to the city.\n\nHe promised to pay everything by September 13th but disappeared on the day. We managed to get his family involved, and he eventually surrendered to the police. Turns out, he was just using the credit card funds to pay other and so on (\"Iski Topi Uske Saar\"). Both of them now claims that the other person has most of the missing money.\n\nCurrently, over 200 people are victims, with the total amount stolen exceeding ₹10 crore. We’ve filed a complaint with the city police commissioner, and the case will be forwarded to the local police station. I’m not sure what our next steps should be.",

By the looks of it he has married and settled again. \n\nSeparated 12 years ago when I had to return from the UK to my parents place. I filled for Domestic Violence case in India and was granted maintenance (per month) of 75l for myself and 50k for my son. The father doesn’t pay the maintenance amount and also no effort to meet the boy. Initially when he did made efforts through court I allowed to meet the boy. But no efforts anymore for the last 5-6 years. \n\nMy husband (ex) filed for divorce in the UK and was granted based on our PR status there then which made this legal in UK. Divorce granted in the UK doesn’t hold in India and I did not contest the decision even though I was served papers. \n\nI have not filed for Divorce in India.\n\nThe arrears are accumulating(over 1cr) and my lawyer is representing the case for the last many years. Convinces me that at some point the party will have to come on the table to negotiate or passport impounded through police case. The legal case is not much of a cost or effort to me as I am not required much in the court and lawyer represent. \n\nI like to understand what are my options and how should I be thinking? \n\nIf you are a men and in similar situation please do not be abusive and don’t write anything negative if you can’t be positive.

        "text": "Hello All, looking for some legal advice.\n\nThis is pertaining to Bhakti Park /Ajmera i-Land Wadala, Mumbai.\nIt is at least 20 yr old group of societies build by Ajmera. It also houses the original Imax dome theater. Now it can be roughly divided into 2 areas, the old Bhakti Park and the new Ajmera i-Land. There are a lot of Housing societies there, at least 4 phases, each phase having at least 2 housing societies. Overall there must be more 15 housing societies. There are a lot of commercial shops  banks etc too. There is also a BMC maintained garden and regular BEST bus services also pass through the internal road. The issue is, the access of all these Bhakti park  societies is via private road maintained by the Developer, though the area was never gated or controlled. On other hand, the Ajmera i-Land (a lot more expensive and affluent societies), is right opposite Bhakti park, is gated and entrance/exit is controlled. The i-land that is facing Bhakti park has banks and shops, the access to which is only through the original Bhakti park. Now the builder has recently put up  electronic barricades controlling access to the old Bhakti park internal road, and is charging for street parking on those roads. The societies have their own gated parking but they are limited. Since the Bhakti park residents are refusing to pay the parking charges, he has allowed the surrounding slums and chawls to park their taxes, cabs. There is even a car dealer parking his fleet there. There are other issues such as lack of periodic sanitation and garbage pick up, street lights not being maintained etc. On other hand, \nthe i-land is well maintained because a lot of properties there are unsold and new developments are coming up.\n In an ideal scenario,the internal roads should either be handed over to the societies or BMC/relevant govt. authorities. There is also dispute regarding the club houses which were supposed to be maintained lifetime by the developer but he isn't maintaining them anymore abd wants to hand them over to the societies.\n\nThere is a residents whatsapp group but all they do is bark, no biting. There isn't any tangible action until now. Some society members have met the developer but it is unclear what the outcome was.\nSay as a resident of one's of those societies, can I individually do something. If not, how does one go about legally uniting everyone to take collective and corrective action.\nThank you\n\nedit:to add the societies want the roads to be handed over to BMC or relevant authorities. There is also an issue of safety because of no street lights. There is Mhada society and a lot of slums and often Chhapri kids speeding onn bikes, sometimes Eve teasing. Then there are terribly lit isolated areas where these chapris come to drink or make out. It is a disaster waiting to happen, especially with a lot of abandoned cars.",

Take a moment to chill, breathe, and analyze it thoroughly.\n'Cause we're about to discuss a deal between you and me, and I need you to be on point. You do not know me whereas I know you and you must be thinking how, correct?\nYou've been a bit careless lately, clicking through those girlie videos and clicking on links, stumbling upon some not-so-safe sites. I actually placed a Malware on a porn website & you accessed it to watch(you know what I mean). And while you were busy watching those videos, your smartphone began working as a RDP (Remote Control) which allowed me total accessibility to your smartphone. I can look at everything on your screen, flick on your cam and mic, and you wouldn't have a clue. Oh, and I have got access to all your emails, contacts, and social media accounts too.\nWhat did I do?\nBeen keeping tabs on your pathetic life for a while now. It's just your bad luck that I came across your misadventures. I gave in more time than I should have looking into your personal life. Extracted quite a bit of juicy info from your system. and I've seen it all. Yeah, Yeah, I've got footage of you jerking off in your room (nice setup, by the way). I then developed videos and screenshots where on one side of the screen, there's whatever garbage you had been watching, and on the other half, it is your vacant face. With just a single click, I can send this filth to every single of your contacts.\nWhat should you do?\nYour confusion is clear, but don't expect sympathy. As a family man, I am willing to wipe the slate clean, and allow you to move on with your life and forget you ever existed. I am about to present you two options. Either ignore this message (not recommended) or pay me a small amount to close this mattter for life. Let's examine these two options in details.\nFirst Option is to ignore my e-mail. Let me tell you what will happen if you choose this path. Your video will get sent to all of your contacts. The video was lit, and I can't even fathom the embarrasement you'll face when your colleagues, friends, and fam watch it. But hey, that's life, ain't it? Don't be playing the victim here.\nSecond Wise option is to pay me, and be confidential about it. We will name it my \"keep the secret charges\". Lets discuss what will happen when you select this path. Your dirty secret remains private. I'll wipe everything clean once you send payment. You'll send the payment through Bitcoins only. I want you to know I'm aiming for a win-win here. My word is my bond.\nRequired Amount: USD 6000\nBITCOING ADDRESS: 179WcntobalaLp990Fxcyu8P2g6ZWCguT\nOr, (Here is Bitcoin QR code, you can scan it):\nOnce you pay up, you'll sleep like a baby. I keep my word.\nAnd of course: You got one day to sort this out. (I've a unique pixel within this email message, and right now I know that you've read through this e-mail). My system will catch that Bitcoin payment and wipe out all the dirt I got on you. Don't even think about replying to this, it's pointless. The email and wallet are custom-made for you, untraceable. I don't make mistakes, Marcus. If I catch that you've shared or discussed this message with anyone else, your video will instantly start getting sent to your contacts. And don't even think about turning off your phone or resetting it to factory settings. It's pointless. Let's get this sorted out within 5-6 hours, I'm waiting for the payment.\nHonestly, those online tips about covering your camera aren't as useless as they seem.\nDon't dwell on it. Take it as a little lesson and keep your guard up in the future.\n“\n\nTL;DR: I am getting scam mails regularly. The mails have same pdf regarding some juicy info about me (which is factually wrong) and wants to extort money from me in the form of bitcoin\nI am ignoring this email as of now but I am getting it on regular basis now. So just wanted some advice if this is something that should be taken to cyber authorities or something. \n\nThank you",

We are looking to get a mutual consent divorce and wanted to get advice on how best to proceed while living in the US. We can visit Delhi later this year, if needed for divorce. We are on good terms with each other and wish to proceed with the quickest path forward.\n\nOur future plan: I will continue to live in US, and she will *likely* move to some other state in US or any other country (other than India) by the end of this year.\n\nAny advice is appreciated. Thanks!\n\nEdit: we have been living in WA, US for more than a year. I’m on H1B and she is on H4 visa here.",

I kept it zero balance, but whenever I go to bank to close the account they ask me to pay Non maintenance charges which is around 8k-9k. I have HDFC Bank current account too where they charged me non maintenance charges in minus but after the complaint in CRM they removed it. But SBI denying it by all means even branch employee being so rude. My friend from another city having sbi current bank account closed the account without paying any charges as his bank manager removed it but my branch manager doesn't even talk properly, he says should I pay from my pocket ? What the heck? I didn't asked this. I said since other branches of your bank are removing the charges and closing the account why don't you? Even other banks removing the charges, I have recently filed the complaint in banking ombudsman after 3 months of regular email to sbi customer care which they didn't do anything about it. What should I do so I get remove those charges now pls give me some advice since hdfc Bank removed the charges even though it was same current account as sbi. ",

I asked this because I wanted a different piece of the same model because i was scared that its old and sitting out, probably being roughly handled badly by people so it might be having some imperfections that i cant inspect there in the rush and the store would’ve closed in an hour so the sales guy was kinda rushing me too. \n\nI got the glasses and had them for a month and 12 days. One day when i was cleaning them i saw that there’s a small crack on curve part that goes behind your ear. I was like wth is this. \n\nI called Lenskart and told them this issue and they told me that there’s no warranty on your item because its a replacement piece and they cant do anything about it. I said that cmon its still an item that you guys gave me so there should be at least 50-100 day warranty on it, after all its some kind of manufacturing defect and my previous pair was accepted as a return because of the same reason. \n\nI threatened them to go to consumer court as well but they said that’s your choice we cant stop you but as of now we cant do anything for you. \n\nNow I don’t know what to do and i have to use this pair everyday 24*7. My hair gets stuck in that little crack too. \nPlease give advice on what I should do now. ",

I wrote mails to the university and university had refund the money to them it has been a month and those councellors aren't giving it back ....at first it was about how I should take a different course and then later on about how it takes 20days to refund and all .....all fine by me it's been a month and these past days I called everyday....there was this lady who said by the evening,  within 2 days you will get but today when I called there was this senior of hers who picked up the call and started screaming on the phone and now he says it will take another month.\n\n\n\nI have dealt enough with them and I wanna complain about them or just do something about it but I have no clue how.....I just have their phone numbers and whatsapp chats and yes their names as well...I am from a middle class family and 16000 is a lot for me and I need the money for other stuff.\nIf anyone has any idea on what I can do in a situation like this please do let me know.\nThank you",

Surprisingly, she has filed for Divorce in Canada despite of the fact that Divorce for muslims in India is very easy. She deliberately filed for Divorce in Canada to get share in property(though did not contribute for a single dollar in entire life) and to get the child custody. \n\nHusband has moved to India for good and do not have plans to return to Canada. Though she was physcially living in India for the last 17 months and having access to Indian Judiciary she filed for divorce in Canada through her lawyers. She does not work and she is a home maker. \n\nQuestion: Since we are married in India as per Muslim rituals and living in India for the last 17 months can the husband move to India court for divorce. Will the divorce petition in India be accepted?\n\nNote: There is no official acknowledgement that the divorce was filed in Canada. The court  papers were put in our parking lot which is a common parking area for the apartment building. ",

However, this approach has been \r\ncriticized for perpetuating patriarchal norms and limiting the rights of women. \n\n\nRegistration of marriage makes no sense\n\n\nGandharva: With mutual consent and driven by their shared love and sexual urges, the bride \r\nand groom are united in this type of marriage. Without going through any religious rites or \r\nrituals, the bride and groom establish a physical union because they are so enamoured \n\n\nOf the eight forms of hindu marriage this one only makes sense in modern india.\n\nMany  others speak of dowry  and also payment to girls father.\n\n\nRakshasa: In this type of marriage, a girl is kidnapped forcibly and wedded to a man who \r\nwants to marry her, but her father won’t let it. When the bride’s guardians are attacked and \r\neither killed or wounded, the people by the groom’s side whisk the girl away while she wails, \r\ncries for aid, breaks open the door, or secures forced entry into the home. This union is still \r\ncommon among the Barrar and Betul of Gonda castes.\n\n\nThis should be legal then .. fuck\n\n\nPaishach: This is the last form of marriage. Under this, a male seduces women and engages in \r\nsexual activity with them while the woman is either sleeping, intoxicated, or mentally \r\nunstable, typically at night. Because of the embarrassment of such behaviour, the girl’s \r\nparents must consent to the girl’s marriage to the man. The term “paishacha” refers to \r\nnighttime nocturnal goblins. It is comparable to an act of rape, which is the most heinous \r\ncrime that can be committed today and is penalised under section 376 of the IPC. Rape \r\noffenders must serve a minimum of seven years in jail, with the possibility of a lifelong \r\nsentence and a fine.\n\n\nNothing to say\n\n\nThen again\n\n\nHINDU MARRIAGE HAS CONTRACTUAL NATURE\r\nThe industrial revolution and its lofty ideals of liberty and equality led to the current \r\nunderstanding of marriage as a contract. The highest human and social relationship that man \r\nhas ever experienced, i.e., marriage, must also be firmly grounded on the free volition of \r\nindividuals if human and social interactions do not grow out of “status” and are instead based \r\non that of individuals. As a result, marriage started to be regarded as contractual in nature.\n\n\n\nContrarily, the Hindu marriage has ceased to be an unbreakable and immortal connection. \r\nWidow weddings are permitted. Furthermore, it allowed divorce. Although a sacred \r\nceremony is required, it is nevertheless possible to refer to the union as holy or sacred. As a \r\nresult, \n\nSo by these words men and women can leave anytime.\n\nRight to divorce \n\nBut why is the union still called holy or sacred?\n\n\naccording to the Vedas and Shastra, marriage is considered a sacred union. Now, the \r\nwhole society has transformed and some elements of the contract were added to the marriage\n\n\nMakes better sense\n\n\nHindu marriage law has provisions that imply that marriage is also a legal contract. \r\nWhen permission is significant for marriage, how does it resemble the contract? It reaches a \r\nsacrament since most weddings still require a sacred ceremony.\n\n\nDosent make sense. Then prenuptial agreements( prenups) should be legal to? Right?\n\n\n\nHence, Hindu Marriage is neither a pure contract nor a pure sacrament but a mixture of both \r\ncontract and sacrament. In conclusion, this paper argues that Hindu marriage is a complex \r\ninstitution that contains both contractual and sacramental elements. A nuanced understanding \r\nof the nature of Hindu marriage is essential for developing appropriate legal and social \r\nstructures that can protect the rights of all individuals involved. Further research is needed to \r\nexplore the implications of these findings for policy and practice.\n\n\n\nWith increase of divorce and false cases of 498a, domestic violence,  it is time prenups are made legal. Right??\n\n\nSummary--\n\n\nBhagwati Saran Singh v. Parmeshwar Nandar Singh\n- court held hindu marriage is not only a sacrament but also a contract. \n\nAlthough it is not a pure contract as there is no consideration. It sorta is a mix of both, a sacrament and a contract.\n\n\n\nSo why not legalize prenuptial agreements ( prenups)???\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I haven’t called the police because it will later take a legal route if they get involved.

I had to write to management that training was not proper and take some action to get it on track. \n\nAlso the training was unpaid. No Stripend was given by the company and the company registered us all the off campus recruiters in National Apprenticeship Training Scheme (NATS) after becoming an employee and completing probation.

        "text": "I have lodged a complaint with Tata Motors via email. To provide full context, I suggest reading my initial complaint email to the company. Despite this, I have not received any response from them. Instead, I received a call from the service center, informing me that they would not repair my car free of charge. I requested formal confirmation of this decision via email, but I have yet to receive any communication from them, even after more than two weeks.\n\n\nEmailed on 3 feb 2024:\n\nDear Tata Motors Customer Support,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention the ongoing issues we have been facing with our Tata Nexon, purchased in 2018.\n\nIn the initial three years of ownership, the vehicle performed adequately. However, post that period, we encountered a persistent problem where engine oil was mixing with coolant. Despite visiting the Tata Service Center three times for resolution, the problem persisted. The first two attempts at repair by the service center proved ineffective, and only on the third visit was the issue addressed appropriately.\n\nIt is crucial to note that for each of the three repairs, we paid a substantial amount to the Tata Service Center, expecting a permanent solution to the recurring problem. \n\nNow, after two years, we are confronted with a new problem related to the engine, and the estimated repair cost stands at approximately 1.67 lakh rupees, subject to further inspection. It is our belief that the failure to rectify the initial issue adequately during the first two attempts has contributed to the current problem.\n\nGiven the recurrence of issues and the substantial cost involved, we request Tata Motors to undertake the repair free of charge. We are not willing to entertain further involvement from the Tata Service Center and kindly ask that Tata Motors take full responsibility for resolving this matter.\n\nI kindly request that Tata Motors confirm its willingness to bear all charges for repairing our car or explicitly state if you are unable to fulfill this request. If the latter is the case, we regret to inform you that we will have no option but to escalate this matter to the Consumer Court.\n\nI trust that Tata Motors, as a reputable company, will take the necessary steps to address this situation promptly and provide a satisfactory resolution.\n\n(I'm hereby  attaching the screenshot of my previous complaint as well specifically mentioning my concern at that time about engine seizure)\n\nI look forward to your prompt response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmailed on 27 feb 2023:\n\nI am writing this email with a great sense of fear and concern regarding the repeated engine oil leak issue in our TATA Nexon XT - Diesel car, which we purchased in May 2018. This problem has occurred for the third time now, and it has become a severe safety hazard for us.\n\nWe are extremely worried and scared to drive this car as the engine oil leaks into the coolant compartment, and there is a possibility of the engine seizing or even the car catching fire. The \"check engine\" symbol does not turn on in the display, and we are unaware of the issue until it escalates and either we notice oil leakage outside the coolant compartment or smoke coming out from the same.\n\nWe have got this problem fixed before at your authorized service center, but this issue seems to be prevalent, and it keeps happening. We are facing a lot of inconvenience and danger because of this car, which is a faulty product manufactured by TATA Motors.\n\nI want to know who will be responsible if anything such happens. This repeated issue has put our lives in danger, and we are losing trust in the brand. I would like to know what steps TATA Motors is willing to take to resolve our problem and prevent any further occurrences.\n\nWe request TATA Motors to take immediate action and fix this issue once and for all. We do not want to put our lives and the lives of others at risk by driving this car any further.\n\nI hope that this email conveys the gravity of our situation, and we look forward to hearing from you soon.\n",

        "text": "I'm in a complicated family situation and need some advice. My grandfather, who passed away recently, had written a will where he left all his land to my uncle (his son), and nothing to his daughters, one of whom is my mother. This will was duly registered.\n\nHowever, we've just found out that my uncle has lost the original will. My mother and her sisters are understandably disappointed and upset that they were left out of the will. Now, with the original will gone, I'm wondering if there is any legal ground for my mother and others to contest the will and claim a share of the inheritance.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation or has legal expertise in matters of inheritance and lost wills? What are our options here? Can the absence of the original will be used to challenge its contents or its execution? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated.",

If she cannot take care of the third one then I am completely Ok to live with all three of them post filing.\n\nI would like to close my current house which I owned with my first wife (and eventually put up for sale).\n\nCan I instruct her to move back to another jointly owned apartment (70% me and 30% her), which is also in the same city.\n\nBasically I would not like to live with her anymore. I am OK if she wants the custody of our third daughter which is biologically hers, and I am OK too to move away from her with all my three daughters.\n\nIn short how do I initiate a legal separation from her where we physically live in different apartments.\n\n&#x200B;",

In order to contribute our bit towards sustainable development vis-a-vis environmental impact and in line with the various guidelines issued by Ministry of Forest & Environment, Govt. of India, we encourage our customers to bring in their own carry bags while shopping with us. In cases, where the customer still wishes to buy a disposable paper carry bag, we charge a nominal price towards it, which is intended to discourage such blatant use of disposable paper carry bags. It is hereby clarified that as a standard process, at the time of billing of merchandise at our store, all customers are specifically given a choice and duly asked by the billing staff, if they would like to purchase a disposable paper carry bag. Only upon getting an express consent from the customer, the disposable paper carry bag is billed to the customer and products are packed therein.\n\nIf you are not satisfied with the company response and want to pursue the case with the company for further relief/ compensation in the absence of suitable/ acceptable redressal, you may file a case at the designated Consumer Commission online.

I've only lived here for a week and thought the owner would have some humanity (I'm from chd where people are a little more cooperative trusting anyone here was a mistake i realise that) and give me back my 2nd month deposit and security too but he says the \"lock in\" was 6 months and us vacating earlier is our problem.\nHe's mentioned everything he's giving in the contract like fully working AC etc but the AC stops working midway through out the day and one of the two bathrooms is non functioning. So he isn't keeping his side of the deal too, is there a way around this? \nIf anyone wants the aggreement copy lmk.",

        "text": "Disclaimer: this is not legal advice. I am not a lawyer. This is a parody post meant for humour and to be considered as such.\n\nIf you end up in an unfortunate situation where your pet dog attacks someone and they threaten to file a case against you, here is how and why you can get away Scot free. \n\nLegally speaking, stray dogs are allowed to attack anyone (humans or dogs) and there's not a damn thing anyone is allowed to do about it. All you have to do is make it look like this is a stray that attacked the other person. Fortunately, this is extremely easy and simple. Most municipalities require pet dogs to be registered. If you never registered your pet, which most people don't, no one can prove that it is your pet. Keep the dog outside your door. Give it food outside your doorstep. That's it! Feeding strays is completely legal. When you become a stray dog feeder, you're a good Samaritan and you're completely absolved of any harm the dog causes. This is a grey area and you can say shit like \"he's a stray. I like to keep my door open for him sometimes and sometimes he does walk through the open door and into my house. No, he's not my pet\". Here's the benefits:\n\n1. The dog would like to live in front of your house so he will stay there. Relocating dogs is illegal so no one can do that.\n2. Hurting strays by killing or poisoning them is also illegal. No one can do that.\n3. Free vaccination and sterilisation at tax payers' expense. Just call local municipality or ngo and they'll take care of it. You get a free ride. Legally, they are required to bring the dog back to the location they found it. So no worries.\n4. Abandoning dogs is illegal. Technically speaking, you're feeding the dog every day in front of your house. So no, you're not abandoning the dog and that argument doesn't work even if somehow it was proved that it is your pet.\n\nTldr; just pretend it is not your dog and that it is some stray you feed. That's it!",

So this professor believes in extreme hierarchial relation between a teacher and a student and expects students to be very obedient and subservient. It's been only one and a half month since my college has started but she has been targetting me. She hyper reacts on smallest of issues and starts yelling. She is also been giving threats of putting a semester back and of reducing the internal marks and she has already done this to some seniors who got into trouble with her. Her behaviour is extremely unprofessional. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently she saw me keeping my phone under my desk and started yelling at me and insulting me. She demanded to give my phone to her but I refused. She asked me to get out of the class and now she is not letting me sit in the class. She said she won't put my attendance or let me attend lectures until I bring my parents in college and apologize. I have explained the whole situation to my TG (we have a teacher-guardian system) as well as the HOD and the principle, but so far they have been unreactive. I have also informed my parents about this. But I don't want to bring my parents and prefer to handle it independently. My parents are paying a hefty amount of fees to the college, but this is what we get in return.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat options do I have right now? Can the professor demand to confiscate something personal like my phone or demand to bring my parents? I am legally an adult right now. What do I do if she reduces my presenty or internal marks or puts semester back?\n\nKindly help.",

They ( station in charge) told me that they would call if they get  any info about the laptop and after more than a week they called me as they had sized a bunch of stolen laptops and caught some thieves as well and they told me to check if mine was one of them. I checked but my laptop wasn't there. They showed me the newly caught thieves who were huddled inside their blankets in the lock-up. I was furious and grinding my teeth looking at them. Because the thieves not only stole my laptop but threw my crucial documents, clothes in the gutter.  I thought of asking the police to let me in in the lock up for 5 mins to unleash my wrath on them.  \n\nAnyway, i controlled myself. After that  the police  never called again and i also gave up on it. I feel like even the cops didn't pay much attention to my case. \nNow after many years thinking over that case, i find myself asking these questions: \n\n1. What recourse i could have taken to force the police to take up the case more seriously ? i had hoped that since some of the thieves were already caught it was only a matter of days that the police would extract informations from those thieves and nab the others. I was wrong. Should i have kept them pestering by going to the police station every 5th day? even though they told me they would call? \nIs that the end of the road? \nIt's been more than 4 years now, can i still go and enquire about my case? \n\n2. This is out of curiosity, do Police really charge money for writing FIR? never saw it in movies.Though the police was polite, he just wanted it for his chaai paani, it wasn't like he intimidated me to pay.",

        "text": "Hi Reddit family,\n\nOver the past few months, I’ve been looking for a marriage partner on Jeevansathi and other matrimonial apps. Eventually, I matched with a girl named “X.” At first, our conversations went really well, and I even spoke with her uncle for about 10 days after we matched. I shared her details and pictures with my family to get their approval.\n\nLater, her father came to my home to discuss the marriage proposal. However, at that time, we hadn’t done the kundali matching. My family and her father had a nice conversation about it. In the meantime, we continued talking and getting to know each other, and I started to like her. Things went a bit too fast, and we began sharing intimate photos and having video calls. I made the mistake of doing this before the marriage was even finalized. I was so caught up in the relationship that I promised her I’d marry her soon.\n\nAfter a while, she started acting distant and didn’t seem to care about me. My parents became ill and were hospitalized, and she didn’t even ask how they were doing. Instead, she blamed me for not being in touch with her for a few days. This made me start questioning the relationship. Later, when my family consulted a pandit for the kundali matching, we found out that we’re not compatible.\n\nNow, after 2–3 months, she’s pressuring me to marry her or else she’ll go to the police and file a case against me under IPC 69.\n\nI’m looking for advice on how to handle this situation and would really appreciate any suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I got married in 2023.\n\nTill now, in all paperwork, including agreement to sell, my father and I have been listed as owners 1&2 respectively for the flat, but the registry is yet to happen. \n\nIs there any chance that instead of me, my mother can be listed as owner with my dad in the registry?

        "text": "Hey folks, need some advice here.\n\nI had purchased a couple of Lenskart vouchers from HDFC SmartBuy with my credit card. I used the vouchers and added balance to my lenskart wallet (Rs 8000.00). I wanted to buy contact lenses (have been using Alcon Oasys for the past 8 years) and they are listed on lenskart. I proceed to buy and am directed to a 3rd party website on payment ([Buy Branded Contact Lenses Online - Contactskart IN](https://www.contactskart.com/contact-lenses/branded-contact-lenses.html)). This happens whenever you try to buy \"Branded contact lenses\" (more on this later) from lenskart. The point of concern is that there is no payment method on that website to use my voucher. I call the customer-care, and they try to figure out why I cannot use it (had no idea themselves). Then they put me through to the escalations team, and the guy there tells me that I cannot buy branded contact lenses on lenskart, but can use the balance for purchasing any eyeglasses or frames or Alcon contact lenses (their in-house products in a nutshell). I say I am only interested in the product I want to purchase and if they cannot do that then please refund my wallet money to my bank account. They guy says he can't do either. I have a mail from lenskart customer support where they have mentioned that I cannot buy branded contact lenses from wallet balance, and it is not explicitly mentioned in their policy that I cannot do so (https://ibb.co/3YydQpRc).\n\n  \nHere comes the interesting part. I ask the guy if it is written in their policy that I cannot use Lenskart wallet balance to buy contact lenses from their website. The guy mentions that I am correct, and it is not mentioned anywhere in their policy. He asks me to wait for 2-3 days, post which he calls me and tells me that though I am right, he cannot help me here and advises to buy in house products. Then I raise a complaint on INGRAM consumerhelpline, and they contact me again and repeat the same BS. They send me an FAQ ([lenskart.com/giftcard-faq](https://www.lenskart.com/giftcard-faq)), and there itself in Point 16, it is mentioned that I can buy any product on Lenskart using wallet balance.\n\nFolks, please help me here. My INGRAM ticket status is in progress, and post raising the ticket, their customer support keeps repeating that they cannot refund my money or place an order using the Lenskart wallet balance. They are giving the same reply on a loop, and I am sure they will not help. What happens if the company refuses to comply after raising on consumer grievances? I know I am legally right here, and I have proof in the form of mail (https://ibb.co/3YydQpRc), their own FAQs mention I am right, and a voice recording of the call with the escalation team where the guy agrees I am right legally and from a T&C point of view but says they cannot do anything.

But lately company has started recruting several women in operation department. Nowdays even when lady reliever is not coming we guys are asked to cover them. When my boss asked ladies to do 16 hours or double shift like us and share the overtime burden,they stated that as per labour laws comapnies cannot make any women work more than 12 hours in a day. I want to know is there any such law in maharastra  / central factory act or labour law...also what will be the correct legal way to proceed with this issue\nEdited - question rephrased as it is more about work place equality than slavery...Also it is very common to do overtimes(more than 48hr a week) in 24hr running 3 shift @workplaces like nuclear power plants, refineries.

However, it’s taking forever (been already more than 3 months). Groom thinks that it is not safe or not possible to travel to India without a bail and having an FIR. Is this true? Is that legally a problem or will he not be able to travel back if he has FIR registered without a bail? I am wondering if the groom is trying to find any excuses to bale on marriage with my cousin.

        "text": "\nI am a male. I was sharing a flat with a female. We connected through her post regarding the search for a flatmate. We spoke on phone, connected well, and in fact we met once before I shifted to her place. \nShe was living in that flat from last 8 months, when I moved in. We were splitting the rent and I used to pay 50% of the total rent every month to her. \nI had also given her 50% of the deposit amount. \nWhen I had asked for the agreement, she had said that the owner might increase the rent if he gets to know that now the flat is being shared. So she suggested that we will get the agreement renewed with my name once our lease expires (which was supposed to happen after 3 months of me moving in). She also used to ask me to UPI for random stuffs, and I used to do that because I knew I will adjust it in the rent at the end of the month (as she used to pay the whole rent to the owner (about 55K). \n\n3 months later, when our lease was about to expire, she informed me that she hasn’t been paying the rent to the owner since last 6-7 months. Owner was pushing for it everyone, but I think they were just nice people go were not taking anything to extreme as they also had the deposit of about 3 lakhs. Now that the deposit ran off, the owner didn’t have any choice. And now the owner was threatening to file a complaint against her. I moved out of that house because I didn’t want to deal with this shit, and I asked her to take care of it. (The owner did file a complaint, and she had to go to police station once). I don’t know what was their deal, but she told me that the owner is expecting the dues to be cleared in 3 parts in the same month. I didn’t follow up after that).\n\n\n\n\nNow coming to the main point - \n\nShe owes me about 2 lakhs. For her convenience, I told her to repay these in EMIs (20K a month). But she keeps on delaying this as well. She hasn’t started the EMI since last 2 months of me request. I even suggested her to take a loan. But she was like she cannot get a loan because she already has 2 running loans. She has given me her words twice and never stood by them. I only had to follow up and they she always comes up with an excuse - like she doesn’t have a place to stay, etc. Even if had to find a new place and had to give deposit for the new flat. I never came up with an excuse to put a lot of pressure on her. Now I don’t know what to do. What all options do I have? I have the proof of all her lies (chats) and the transaction records.\n\nA little background about her - She comes from a very privileged family. Her father is a very rich man. But she has some issues going on with her family. She doesn’t even talk to her father. He lifestyle was also very lavish (she will buy expensive stuffs, she has perfumes north of 15-20K). But yeah, she doesn’t have money to return even in parts. \n\n\n\nUPDATE:\nA lot of people are asking why did i move without an agreement. I know it’s stupid, but I moved because of the following reasons:\n\n1. I was looking for a flat in that exact society. It was convenient for me. \n2. I wasn’t sure about my job situation, the 2-3 months gave me a bit flexibility in case I decided to move somewhere else. The relative priority for this was low, but this was one of the factors. \n\nI couldn’t have even thought that I will end up in this situation, because I had assumed that people living in that society would be working at good places with good jobs.",

I am a 2024 btech computer science graduate as in my final semester exam ended last month. I'm looking for jobs and planning to move out already. But the situation is so bad I can't focus on my studies or anything as I'm having panic attacks and manic episodes frequently. My boyfriend is willing to house me for a few months before i get a job but he lives in a different state. My family also doesn't approve of my relationship as I met my boyfriend through an online dating app( we have been together for 4 years). He has visited my city and met my mom and a cousin I have never been to his place. Some of my family's fears regarding my boyfriend are 1) what if he's not who he says he is 2) what if he's a Pakistani agent and involved in human trafficking 3) what if he sells me to the middle east people 4) what If he's a pimp 5) what if he's after my moms property or money. Mom has a govt job life is comfortable but we are not rich. Also my boyfriend has a job in IT and works for a company in Bangalore. He's been working remotely for the past 4 years. \n I'm thinking of going to his place and live there temporarily before I get a job and can handle stuff on my own. How can I be prepared once my family decides to come after me legally once I leave ? Info: my dad is an alcoholic and abusive not in the picture and no there is no one absolutely no one on either side of the family I can trust or depend on. What I'm asking is how can I cover my ass once my family takes the legal route to force me to come back ? I would really appreciate any kind of help really...I'm just cornered and I don't know exhausted? Hopeless? Every day I feel like either i need to just die or just disappear stop existing to get one fucking moment of peace\n\nEdit: just putting it here for idk what a few months back my mom asked for my boyfriend's documents for verification (she's been very aloof even though she has known from the beginning that I'm dating this guy ) but my bf refused to share that reasons being his reasons were he has never met someone in my family other than my mom and 1 cousin so we had a fight. But then he sent me his offer letter which I had to give to my mom and then she forwarded it to everyone else who claimed that they would ask around to fact check the guys info. Other info my family wanted were a) man's adhar info b) pan info c) 10th marksheet or birth certificate d) his dad's info (his dad was in the army) but things got worse after he sent the offer letter..as it had been sent to a lot of people and since the past few months things have been idk shit honestly. I sometimes don't understand if I'm overreacting or not reacting properly to this situation at all..",

        "text": "I (25F) got married in Haryana 3 months ago to someone (27M)  my parents wanted me to get married to. I had to been speaking to the guy on & off for almost a year. We met for the first time and our parents started pressuring us for an answer within one day. We said yes because the guy had to travel & settle abroad for work. Also, we said yes under the conditions that “we do not know each other well enough and still need time but because he needs to travel and for the sake of your (our parents’) peace of mind, we can do a roka but it should strictly only stay between us”. They agreed, but unfortunately told each and every member of the family, so ofcourse it didn’t only stay between us. Now, we were legally married less than a week of us meeting for the first time because these formalities needed to be done for my spouse visa so I can travel once we married. Our marriage date was set for December 2024. While all of this happened, the guy & I tried to spend as much time as we could together. I didn’t enjoy his company even a little bit. Great guy, great family but I couldn’t find that comfort or friendship level with him. I constantly told my parents that I’m unsure about this (from day 1) and they told me to “trust them” so I tried. The guy & I both have a past. From some of his conversations it felt like he didn’t want to/ could not move past it. Anyway not sure if that’s something I can comment much on. Now, sexual intercourse is very important for me in a relationship. So, we had sex once with both of our consent, however I wasn’t too comfortable with it because obviously it had been less than 20 days of us meeting for the first time, but I did it to see how satisfactory it would be for me. Now, days before he had to travel back to the US, he asked me to few times to have sex. I said no saying stating my exact reason (me not being comfortable enough and I had sex earlier to see how compatible and satisfactory it would be). He said ok let’s go to a hotel we’ll just kiss and stuff and not have sex. I wasn’t 100% okay with the idea but I said okay. When we went, he kinda forced himself on me even though I constantly said no I’m not comfortable and I think it’s a bad idea. I didn’t physically fight it back, didn’t shout or anything but just told him I’m not comfortable. He still had sex with me. Almost for 20-30 minutes, on & off. I consider it rape to be very honest. But I don’t want to put any kind of allegations on him. He comes from a nice family, they have known my parents for almost 30 years. Now, he went to the US. We kept talking on the phone. Again, I couldn’t feel that level of comfort or friendship with him. But I still wanted to hear my parents out and kept trying to build a relationship. I could not do it. Now, I’ve put my foot down and told everyone that I do not want to go ahead with this. What’s the process of anulment/ void marriage / divorce? ",

        "text": "Hello All, I need advice on should I consult a lawyer or I am being paranoid. \nWe have been married for 5.5 years.We stay in a different Work city than our original city\nI have been diagnosed with anxiety for past 2.5 years (getting covid, wfh etc probably caused it).\nThis year wife was away to her parents country (they moved away to a western country) I stayed with my parents. Saw or experienced a few fights and got worse. \nWife came back, we moved back to work city. I was a mess, cried randomly. Doctor diagnosed me with Bipolar, gave me new meds and I stabilized. \nWife started getting depressed, I didn't notice because I wad in a mess,  her parents came back to India, she moved with them , got diagnosed with depression. She got like a week of me in stable condition. Then left. \nHer doctor psychiatrist (who is Pals with her father who himself is a retired doctor) clearly wrote \"lack of emotional support\" and \"inter personal relationships issues\" with husband as cause of her depression.\nNow she has been away for few months. I have seem her on a couple of weekends when I have traveled back to our home city. We fought a lot, both on chats, calls and in person. \nI asked to consult a marriage counselor.\nWe had individual sessions.\nHer father came to my city, met me, I gave him positive vibes, he gave me assurance that she ll come back to me soon  \nMeanwhile she moved most of her stuff,including all  jewelry etc from my parents place (our official home address on aadhar passport etc since we live on rent in home city). We fought again but she wouldn't give reason. My parents suggested that her behavior indicates she wants to separate. \n Later her father asked for her documents like Degrees n stuff and including marriage certificate which were with me. I asked why she is taking everything away when we were supposed to get back together. Father in law Said he wants to apply for a long term visa for my wife  to the western country we are in.(I suspect  For whatever reason Marriage certificate is one of the most important document in the sense that they ll give her a long visa with multiple entry exits because they ll think she has a husband to go back to).I say you guys can take all her documents but Not getting marriage certificate since it is a joint document. Also as a husband I m not okay with her applying for long term residency to another country. FYI my father in law, his son, daughter in law and mother in law all live under the same long term residency and my brother in law works illegally there (Dunky style?) \n We have our first joint session. before the session, she calls me, asks for a dress left at my parents place, all \"jaanu\" me. At the session she  shared her concerns, most importantly the feeling of neglect. FYI I have never physically or verbally abused her. She doesn't want to give the relationship a chance. At a lot of insisting from counselor and me, she says she ll give it like 20%. We both cry. Counselor gives her a week to decide and give a firm yes or no. In between we are not to contact each other. \nShe texts me saying she has decided to give me a chance but doesn't wanna see the counselor. That rings alarm bells. She says she ll come back my work city and our rented flat on so n so date. I tell her that I ll be working that day and the week and won't be there to bond with her during the day. Why not wait for another week and we ll go for a romantic holiday. She says a firm no and that they ll be there fir a week. . Also her parents will also be in our work city but at a different place during that time\nThe alarm bells in my head say that they are laying some kind of a trap. Hence no marriage counselor. \nShould I lawyer up? Would a lawyer even help me in this situation? Any recommendations in Pune (work city) or should I get one in Mumbai (our home city where marriage is Registered).  Besides my mental health issues work wise I m still a fully functional average employee. Will that play anything into all this? \nApologies for long post, kindly advice.\n\nUpdate:She did it, she divorced me. She came to Pune but never came to stay. She came once when I was super sick, like 10 days sick because of  flu. I asked her to not come during that time because she ll catch it, plus she ll just be a miserable care giver.\n\nWhen I was nearing recovery, she met me at a coffee shop. We spoke and I asked to come on holiday etc. She didn't,  she Saud no to the relationship. Later our families met and the gave me only one condition,  that I have to be part of their family and live with them because my family can't handle me. I gave them so many options but they didn't listen. I was still being indecisive about signing the khulanama (divorce by wufe). They threatened me with harassment case and police complain. My ex father in law's sister told me upfront. When I called him, he wasn't ready to accept or deny. Worst part, at the kazi's place it was called Mubarakama, meaning mutual divorce. Some rules and rights change in that. We got it changed and also got the mehr back (since we did not meet any of the conditions for a khula, for khula to happen the husband has to be insane continuously for 2 yrs. I had mental disorder but wasn't full crazy. Also my bipolar diagnosis was wrong. I have consulted 2 more doctors and both said it is mood swing, which due OCPD, caused anxiety and depression. Plus I was at my lowest when I was misdiagnosed.So no bipolar, not even the milder version). So yes, as our Islamic law I coukd have mehr back. Mehr is what a guy gives a woman as a condition for the wedding. Like reverse dowry.  I still proposed to consult Muslim personal law board, mandatory 3 counseling sessions by them, or counseling  by an expert on Islam and psychology.They refused everything. They have filed a petition in court too and I m sitting here like an idiot.",

Which is true however no one buys an insurance hoping they'd use it but sometimes you have to. \n\nReaching out to esteemed lawyers to shed some light in terms of what one should do to protect themselves legally in case things go south in a marriage, especially men as we know the law of the land favours the women (rightly so perhaps). Ranging from alimony settlements to fake dowry, harrasment cases. \n\nWhat are some realistic things(you know like basic low hanging fruits and not like getting married in Goa since it might have a prenup) men can do so that the damage is minimised in case things are not in their favour later. \n\nPS - Request you all PLEASE keep the discussion to the legal aspects and not make it subjective and preachy about the topic of marriage. I think a lot of folks will benefit from the discussion. ",

        "text": "I got married last year and we filed a mutual consent divorce recently since things were not working out. We both live in the UK and earn well enough. The girl while not asking for alimony or cash is demanding all the jewelry that was involved in the wedding, the cost of which is around 15L.\n\nThis obviously does not sit right with me since I wasn't gifted shit in the wedding and she is getting away with that 15L for free. Even the wedding expenses were paid by me since we hosted it and her family was not capable anyway.\n\nA few people that I asked around are recommending giving her the jewelry and getting it done with. Tbh 15L is not a huge amount for me and I can definitely afford it, but it's the sense of injustice that is making me think if I should deny that. In that case, they would be filing for a contested divorce which might come with bigger implications.\n\nMy question is, should I give her the jewelry, or should I fight the legal battle? Is it worth the hassle given the laws are skewed against men in India? (Is it still true?).\n\nBasically I would like to know what happens in case of contested divorce and at what risk am I? Any other advice would be helpful. Thanks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for the responses. I understand that giving her the jewelry is best for me. Not a fan of the archaic 'streedhan' law and also how everything blindly supports the women in this country, but thankful that compared to other men who are bullied for bs allegations like false rape and dowry cases, I am in a better position.

        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nSo, mine is a small company. There are many sales guys, though my role is different.\n\nFudging bills is apparently very common there, and I was initiated into this by my team members last year. Told which software to use, and handed over the bills, which were rotated to multiple people. Everyone, including the manager, was pretty open about it.\n\nI got terminated recently. I had done the same. They didn't tell me the reason, but I guess this is the reason. They said they will give experience letter, and equivalent notice pay. They informed me, and then shortly took my laptop and let me go on the same day. It is very very embarrassing.\n\nI do not exactly want to know about the legal course. I just FEEL SO BAD ABOUT MYSELF. I just want to explain it somewhere, and get it off my chest. I am not a dishonest person.\n\nThing is - there are many people in the company who do this. Like I said, I was asked to do this, and instructed how to do it. People are pretty open about it. I know people who did this, who didn't get noticed.\n\nMy reasoning was - since this was happening so openly, since this was so brazen, I thought the management, the approvers knew about this. That that money was due to us, and that bills were just a formality. I didn't think of it as cheating.\n\nThis comes as a total shock to me. The amount is less than 10k. We were told to use it for food, and get the bills reimbursed. I didn't think I was cheating the company. I thought everyone knew, and the bill was just for formality. I have never cheated in my life. This is deeply distressing to me.\n\nAm I a dishonest person lacking integrity?\n\n\\[EDIT - the claim I sent was for a one-time reimbursement. Not recurring ones like travel/lodging etc\\]\n\n  \n\\[ Update - It wasn't for the fake bills. It was a layoff, and not a termination. My whole business unit was let go in a similar manner today. And I spoke with the guy who told me how to fake the bill (he's still there). We both agreed that basically the whole company was doing the same thing. Thanks all for your sympathies and advices and sarcasms.  I got a free, and not a paid life lesson :). \\]",

        "title": "Parents getting divorced, need some clarity (URGENT) ",
        "text": "tldr; need advice about the finances and legality of the divorce, also alimony and child support for education\n\nMy (17F) parents are about to get divorced. My mom is extremely unhappy with my father and his side of the family. In a nutshell, my paternal grandmother and my dad together have emotionally abused my mom for 20 years now, and she's decided that she's had enough.\nI have a younger brother (13M). We're currently situated in Delhi NCR, with a lot of family closeby. My dad is the sole breadwinner; my mom has an MBA and used to work but quit when my brother was born. \n\nNow, my mom is looking a smaller apartment for us to move into. It's going to be nearby because we can't change schools now and we want a place to stay while she finds an attorney and files for divorce. My dad most probably won't agree because he needs someone to do all the work around the house. However, my mom's worried about getting divorced because of the finances (we do have enough savings to get us started and settled in a new house) but because I'm pursuing medicine, it's a long and expensive road ahead. My mom will start working again once we move but it'll take her 3-4 years to get back to the stage she was at and start earning comfortably again.\n\nWhat are the laws for alimony/ child support? Will my dad legally be required to pay for my college education? What about my brother's education? \nIs emotional abuse grounds for divorce? How would we prove that? Is there a way to get the court to stop my paternal grandmother from staying at our house? (she stays with us for 5 months a year, can't describe in words what a b*tch she is)\n\nThe other option is that we ask my father and his mother to leave the house. Because why should my mom and me and my brother have to uproot our lives because of his bullshit? But again, we're not sure of the laws regarding that and if we can ask someone, who's paying rent for the apartment we currently live in, to leave.\n\nAny and all advice would be appreciated. If any lawyers here would be willing to let me DM them about this, I'd be very grateful. Thank you.",

It all started 4-5 months ago when my cousin (her mom) found out that my niece was texting him. He’s the relative of one of her friends. When my cousin found out, she punished her and went to the boy’s house to talk to his parents, explaining that he’s an adult and my niece is just 12. They promised it wouldn’t happen again, and we all thought everything was resolved.\n\nToday, my cousin and her husband visited our home, and I wasn’t fully aware of the situation until now. My cousin shared that she’s still suspicious and caught my niece chatting with him again, this time through a hidden app. I figured out the password for the instagram and went through their messages, and what I saw completely shattered me. The innocent and loving image I had of my niece is gone. They met once in person, and there were explicit photos of them kissing. He’s an addict and a pervert who’s been grooming her, but he manipulated her into sending nudes, sharing porn, and even forcing her and emotionally manipulating her to send him money for alcohol. I literally lost it and vomited after seeing their sexting. As an adult, I would think twice before engaging in something like that, and she’s just 12.\n\nI showed everything to my cousin and her husband, and I strongly urged them to take legal action because she’s a minor about to turn 13, and he’s 21.\n\nI need advice on what we can do to bring this situation back to normal and what legal steps we can take. Any help or guidance would mean a lot right now and also which subs will be helpful if i post it there.\n\nEdit: Not my niece's personal phone she doesnt have one she's using my sister's phone andher grandma's phone. sorry i wrote not solely blamming the boy thinking someone might put blame on us for blamming the boy only as shes also equally involved not in my correct senses since morning.",

        "text": "This was a 7 year long relationship, started with the intention to get married from the very beginning. We had been taking vacations and engaging in physical intimacy since the first month of this relationship. Her parents came to know of it around 3-4 years back and allowed us to date freely. Around 4 months back, both families met together and had a written agreement (known as a lagna patrika) in the presence of a priest, thereby fixing a date of marriage. We then proceeded to engage in shopping for marriage (I bought her whatever she wanted). She then moved to another city, with me reaching there about a week later to help her settle down. I rented out a 3BHK and furnished it fully, with the intention of staying together over there after marriage. After living there for almost two months, I proceeded to head back home. Within a couple of weeks of reaching home, she had a verbal arguement with me over the phone and all of a sudden returned me some of the money that I had spent for the marriage shopping and called of the marriage, blocking me and my family from everywhere (Phone, WhatsApp, Social media etc). We tried to contact their family several times, yet none of them got in touch with us. After about three months, my family went to their house to try and sort things out, but they were insulted and thrown out of their house. Her brother even threatened physical harm to my mother. The entire conversation was recorded. She then proceeded to unblock me and threatened committing suicide if I didn't stop pursuing this.\n\nI have invested a lot of time, money and effort in this relationship. Due to all of these events, I suffered a severe mental breakdown and lost a lot of social credit. She has since returned a part of the money I invested into the apartment. \n\nI would like to initiate legal proceedings against her and her family for breach of promise to marry. I have evidence of cohabitation, evidence of spending huge amounts of money and effort during our 7 year courtship. What are my options?",

We as simple people tried to send him the No broker listings, and helped him with broker too. But he is still not ready to leave. \n\nOnce we had some heated argument, he said do what you want to do.

They also asked me to sign a bond of 5 lakh rupees saying that they will provide me specialized trainings. Upon joining, they assigned me some pre-recorded sessions and did not even ask me to complete those. Later in June, my father was diagnosed with brain tumour and I asked them to allow me to WFH till december which they declined and so I resigned. They asked me serve the 2 months notice period and pay 5 lakh rupees as the training cost. I agreed to the serving the notice period while staying in Hyderabad but refused to pay 5 lakh as I believe they did not spend even a single penny on those trainings. They withheld my 3 months salary (~4.5 lakh) and asked me to pay 50k more which I refused and asked them to pay my salary on hold. Now they have served me with a legal notice asking for 5 lakh + 25 lakh (business loss caused by my actions) + legal fees that they would incur due to this. I am not sure what should I do next - pay them 50k and ask them to not proceed with the legal action or should I send a legal notice myself?\nI am panicking right now so any help or advice is appreciated. \n\nEdit: This is what they are saying caused a loss of 25 lakh \n\nMy client states that the ongoing refusal to adhere to established protocols highlights a troubling pattern of dishonesty and a lack of commitment to the company's standards.

        "text": "First of all let me preface this by saying 2 things. I married down & I did not take dowry.\n\nThis is a long one so feel free to skip some parts if you like, though I urge you to read the whole thing because it's dramatic. popcorn and a drink highly recommended.\n\nIn the next paragraphs I would like to refer to my spouse as \"the girl\" from here and beyond because honestly she was never my wife to begin with. She belongs to the streets. This is my personal choice so please don't mind.\n\nMarried Mid 2022 (arranged, they contacted us through WhatsApp groups within same community). At the time of marriage I was employed in US and she was employed in India.\n\nEngagement + Marriage all happened within 10 days. Looking back, I'd say I had an unreasonable amount of confidence in my parents that they did all the back ground checks. My 2 selection criterias were that the girl should preferably be from same hometown and bonus if girl is an affectionate person.\n\n2-3 weeks post wedding, she reveals to me (after questioning) that she has a 10+ Lakhs loan that \"was\" taken by her parents in her own name few days before the engagement. She claimed to have nothing to do with it, and denied accountability in any regards to her personal loan. I get suspicious a little bit so I delved deeper into her laptop and find that her family has a history of taking loans. (car loan, home loan, personal loan, education loan, more loans to pay existing loans) and basically stretched their own budgets and took a loan in her name to get a gold article so they would seem \"well off\" in the wedding functions. After this news was shared with my parents, they were pretty upset that girl has a loan in her name especially when no dowry was ever asked, no gold demands were made, no money was asked and it was a complete fuck up on her families part that they sent her to our house hold with a negative net-worth. 0 was what I was expecting to start my life with her from. I am well earned till that point of time, I had 5+ years of work ex and was looking to start my life with her in US.\n\nBringing her to US would be a long endeavor, requiring a 2 year min wait and a green card. She was aware and consented to all this before marriage. 1 month post marriage I returned to US and started the visa processing steps and I would return to India every 4-6 months after that. In the meanwhile she was working from home, from my parents home, and sometimes from her parents home. Eventually after a couple months she decided that she likes it more at her parents home.\n\nEvery time I would come to India, whether it be for sankranthi, honeymoon (we had one after wedding and another one during valentines), birthdays, or anniversary, I would always end up in a huge fight with her. She was constantly fighting or creating rifts with my mom/dad. Watching all these misunderstandings happen while I was in US was tough so I tried to talk it out but nothing ever seemed to help. It was like walking on egg shells all the time. Nothing I did was ever enough. No matter how many expensive gifts I got, no matter how many trips I planned and paid for, no matter how much gold or jewelry and fancy sarees I got her during special occasions were ever enough. There would always be comparisons made to what \"others\" in her family example book did for their spouses. I would always find her mom and sister with her gaslighting and using one another as flying monkey's to teach me that \"more\" was expected. Each trip to India was like a 3-4L trip. I was like fine bro, that what a man's gotta do. All this shit will be over once we are actually abroad and there will be no noise to disturb us on a daily basis.\n\nFrom my understanding. She is a total penny-pincher. I have never seen her spend money once actually out of her own. I pre-assumed that maybe it's because though she switched the loan out of her name, she might still be paying a loan somewhere. I thought alright at least, though she isn't telling me, there is accountability in some way and she's cleaning her own messy financials. That is what I thought and similarly, to every one of her red flags I applied some dumbass justification or another. Let me also add here that there was no physical aspect to the relation ship because it was too painful for her when I tried to have intercourse. At first I thought it was genuine pain and respected that boundary but now I'm starting to doubt if that was ever true in the first place.\n\nAs the visa processing continued, things start getting very rough, during one of the trips I was in India. She 'hinted' that she would file some cases and she knows what to do. This was during one of the last days before I had to head back to US. Once I headed back the abuse continued just over the phone and video calls. By this point, I had started to get some severe doubts about her sanity. Started to read about Indian laws and soon realized that I have to start covering my bases. I started recording all the calls, all the the video calls, looking into her laptop disk (which I had snapshotted from earlier and it had a wealth of information about her) and started to realize that she was about to get married to someone right before she met me. The other family (guy) broke it off because they caught on to their bluff about their financial status long before I could. I procured her income statement and started journaling my feelings on a daily basis so I could look back and take a stand on how I feel the relationship overall because it was getting super confusing with all the love bombing.\n\nOn one fine day, during one of arguments she had a slip of tongue and accidentally said something that completely woke me up. She said that she felt no need to take care of my parents during old age and something along the lines of \"I am totally fine if they die\". That broke my heart to be honest and that's when I spent the next 48 hrs digging through all the data I had on her, reviewed everything one final time and took a decision. I canceled the citizen ship application by informing USCIS that I will not be proceeding with the application. I proceeded to inform my employer about resigning and they instead offered me a role in India for lower comp. I booked flight tickets for me to come back to India after 2023 ended. My plan of action at that point was, come to India, live with her for real without parents, assess on the ground level if going to US and having a life in US was even worth it and then take a call what to do next. Giving her green card just because we \"were\" married did not make sense to me because I honestly did not trust this girl. I didn't inform the girl about citizenship cancellation, nor job switching, I just went into isolation because it was sad that I was leaving my US career and I wanted to enjoy every remaining day in US to the fullest and free from the constant narc abuse, with friends, spending time in beautiful nature and scenic locations. When I stopped answering her calls, the isolation drove her crazy. She would constantly be on my ass trying to track what happened to the citizen ship application and I would always tell her that I am thinking about it that I don't know how I am going to proceed and that I don't think we have the required levels of trust and understanding.\n\nAfter a month of no contact, one fall evening, she shows up at my US address to my complete surprise. She came to US on a tourist visa which was granted because the interviewer saw that she had a pending GC application and gave her the B1/B2 based on her interview. She told the interviewer that she didn't want the GC and interviewer was like suit yourself. GC >>>> B1/B2. take B1/B2 and fuck off.\n\nOnce in US, she tried to woe me into sex immediately. I was like hold up..... first of all, we haven't talked in over 4 weeks and didn't you say it was hurting all the time we were in India? but apparently not anymore. When I tried to sit down with her 1:1 to level with her, it became sooooo clear that she was a covert narcissist. To her, I am just an object to manipulate and extract $$$ from and pay her loans. A child was meant to be used as a weapon.\n\nOnce I closed the door on the sex part because her traveling to US to spend time with me \"actually\" a three tier manipulation matrix along the lines of.... 1) get him (me) to have sex, use pregnancy as leverage to stay in US or dictate the relationship. 2) Next, if he doesn't comply, food poison him, teach him a lesson and 3) if he doesn't comply even then create a argument (which she is an expert in), file a VAWA petition and get a green card after proving domestic violence. All three plans were spotted early by me, but yes I was still food poisoned by her in the US while she was living in my rented apartment.\n\nAfter the food poisoning, I immediately went to the nearest the police and they forwarded me to get a restraining order. To file the RO, I approached a US lawyer and he's like this is going to be super expensive and even then to get a divorce, you would have to prove you are married in the first place which would give her an upper hand.... so all in all, this doesn't end well if you stay in US.\n\nSo, that's when I took that call that I must prepone my work relocation and move back to India and deal with whatever the fuck happens in India regardless of women's laws etc. because US divorce doesn't guarantee divorce in India. So I play this insane diplomatic game, act naive and say let's go back to India, get her to agree, book flights, and on the day of the departure....she flips and says I won't come.\n\nI had to call 911 and 2 officers show up, realize that she is dressed to goto airport, luggage is in the car to goto airport and she is stalling and squatting in a house that is not rented by her after it got dark out and these officers talked some sense into her and she got into the car and we go to the airport. After we checked our bags man that was a HUGE fucking sigh of relief for me.\n\nFast forward, We land in India in our hometown and I just walked out of the airport on my own and left her to deal with her luggage and her shit and didn't look back. After the food poisoning thing and realizing that she definitely would have filed VAWA petition I didn't respect this girl anymore even to make eye contact. just left the airport and never looked back\n\nNow it starts --- the actual drama starts\n\nGirl goes to her parents home, files 498A, 506, 509, DPA 3.4 few  weeks after we get to India. (me, parents, sister, BIL)\n\nI am in another city at the time so I respond to 41A notice electronically, get a lawyer and don't goto station but apply AB instead.\n\nShe thought I would come running to her and beg her to take back the case but I was firm on my position and had loads of evidence collected for divorce filing (under cruelty grounds) so I stayed in the same city and waited for bail to go through.\n\nIn a fit of narc rage, one rainy after noon, the girl, along with her parents and uncle break into my parents house in our hometown when we were not in the city. She starts living there with her parents. Tenants record the incident of the lock breaking but she proceeds to break in regardless. Cops were called and they sent some constables to come and check but she tells them stories of being the daughter in law of the house and they back off after taking peanut bribes\n\nAB is granted 3weeks later, we go back to home town and surrender to court and pay up for all the sureties. Parents then goto police station to file a formal complaint regarding break-in and not being able to access their own house. We get the house back after 2 days of police station visits but a lot of things in the house are broken, mom's gold is stolen, and most importantly a property in my name (original document) is stolen by the girl. Finally FIR is filed by my parents for trespass, damage and robbery.\n\nI filed divorce after this (on cruelty grounds)\n\nShe then waits a couple weeks and files RCR and a new curve ball allegation which is section 7C (family courts act) which my lawyer tells me is for dowry articles returning.\n\nThe 498A case which she filed implicates 5 people in total (including myself) but the actual complaint itself is very delusional. It alleges that 1 CR + dowry was given and that my parents and I used to beat the shit out of her regularly demanding additional dowry. She switches from english to local language and goes back and forth like an immature person. It contains irrelevant information that is inserted to seem more intense. But at the end of the day, it's basically a rant about her having to do chores in the house and waking up early. Dude I grew up doing chores like everyone else in the household. In US, there are no maids to depend on. You rely on family members to each take up some responsibilities depending on age when the maid goes AWOL. During COVID, I was in India and when there was no maid, I swept and mopped and helped my parents complete the cleaning. I made the bed, cooked when people were sick and supported in whatever I could. That's how my parents raised me - to be self sufficient. This girl is soo entitled that she put all this petty stuff as a complaint and added that she was harassed immensely and shouted at. She dragged my sister and brother in law in to this when they don't even live in the same city as our hometown. It's comical to read but I know it's still a serious court case. I am ready to fight everything in court. I will destroy this girl when the time comes with the evidence I have. I will prove my innocence and I will protect my family members.\n\nIf any lawyer is reading this or people here that know how this game works, please let me know what to do next that can improve my chances of surviving this situation and how to handle this 7C case. Thank you guys. Take care and godspeed.",

The flight numbers were changed from AI 2581/AI 2582 to AI 9526/AI 9527 for the onward and return journeys, respectively. Since the timings remained unchanged, I didn’t see any reason to be concerned.\n\nFast forward to the day before my trip: I tried to check in online, but the Air India website showed my ticket as cancelled. I immediately called Air India customer care, and they informed me that the booking partner (Goibibo) had canceled my ticket. They advised me to contact Goibibo.\n\nAfter spending 30 minutes on Goibibo customer care, they claimed the onward flight was cancelled and that they couldn’t help. I then reached out to HDFC SmartBuy support, who also confirmed that the onward flight was cancelled but offered a full refund for it. However, they said the return flight was still valid.\n\nThis left me stranded, as I had already made non-refundable hotel bookings. With no affordable flights available at the last minute, I had to book a late-night bus to Goa. Traveling 13 hours with a 3-year-old was stressful, to say the least.\n\nAfter arriving in Goa, I checked the status of flight AI 9526. To my shock, it was not cancelled and departed on time. I have no idea why Air India misled both Goibibo and HDFC SmartBuy, and I was not notified properly.\n\nThis entire ordeal caused significant mental stress, ruined the start of our vacation, and left me questioning the reliability of all three parties involved. I’m now considering taking legal action against Air India, Goibibo, and HDFC SmartBuy.\n\nWhat legal recourse do I have in this situation? Has anyone else faced a similar issue? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n__\n\nLooking forward to hearing suggestions and guidance from the community.",

But today when I was travelling from Hyderabad to Bangalore in AirIndia Express Flight IX 1543 with my wife and 1 year old son , I went to complete my check in to drop bags in AirIndia Express counter. Lady at the counter asked my ID proofs as I was submitting it, she saw my hand & asked what is it. I told Psoriasis, it's skin condition. She immediately informed her manager without talking to me. She told me to wait as her manager will come and stopped my check in process. \n\nHer manager came asked medicial document on my skin condition. I was not aware why they are asking but to make them understand, I told it's psoriasis, it's skin disease which is normal and I showed him previous medical prescriptions which mentions psoriasis in chief complaint. But he was asking doctor certificate which mentions i am ok to fly like that. I didn't get what is he asking , as there is no rule or law to get a medicial certificate for psoriasis to allow me fly. I was trying to explain him it's not contagious and i don't have any document like that. It's only prescriptions I have. I asked him to call your manager and even he checked those prescriptions and told they are 2022 , I cannot allow. You need a medicial certificate and all .. I fought with him saying i frequently fly and i travel in air india express only multiple times this year and showed him digi yatra passes. He was saying i can only allow only if you get this from certified from doctor. Finally he made some calls checking my travel history and told to do my check in to staff.\n\n I didn’t realise if we have a skin condition we have to carry certificate from doctor as i have been travelling last 10 yrs in flights and no one had issue nor is it mentioned in any ticket or documentation.\n\nMy serious concern is what's the reason to ask for a doctor certificate or document to say I am fit to fly. It's not in any guidelines or any rule\\\\Law. They mentally harassed me asking for a document from doctor though I am explaining it and showing prescriptions , medicines i am using. CISF never had issue when they allowed inside airport , neither the security check cisf police had issue with my skin condition while scanning me. Why an airline staff has to stop and ask this and harass me. \n\n  \nI feel so disturbed and sad because of today’s incident and decided not travel with AirIndia express again. They are so reluctant to understand my skin condition and harassed me. My wife had to see all this happening with my 1 year old son. \\] I am looking for legal options to get me justice. An apology from the air india staff, compenstate me for the mental trauma i had to go through.  And not to get this repeated again with any other skin diseased passengers. \n\n\nhttps://x.com/meetteja/status/1847689101643792703?s=46",

They forced me to hand it over immediately, and since the termination was so sudden and unexpected, I didn’t have time to log out of my personal Gmail. My personal Gmail was linked to some office-related newsletters, but I didn’t think much of it at the time because I assumed they would reset the laptop.\n\nYesterday, the IT person from the company contacted me, advising me to log out of my personal Gmail. I explained to him that the termination was rushed, and I simply hadn’t had the chance, but there was nothing suspicious in my emails anyway. However, during the conversation, he confessed that he had accessed my GOOGLE PHOTOS linked to that account—going through 10 years of my personal photos under the pretence of “company policy.”\n\nHe claimed to have found some private photos, including ones I wasn’t even aware were saved there. He said he SAVED THEM, stating he “had a great time” going through my pictures. He even sent me some of the photos as proof and went on to make inappropriate advances, telling me he’d liked me from the beginning and that now, after seeing my photos, he wanted to “taste me.” He made further comments about us having “great chemistry.”\n\nI was terrified and didn’t know how to respond. Out of fear, I told him I’d meet him in person to discuss this, though I have no intention of doing so. When I asked him politely to delete the photos, he said he would but implied he was doing me a favor and expected something in return. He was persistent about meeting in person, drinking, and doing things I am absolutely uncomfortable with. He also said that if someone else had accessed the photos, they wouldn’t have kept them to themselves, implying that I owed him for his “discretion.”\n\nI feel so violated and unsure of what to do. My friends have told me I shouldn’t have agreed to meet him, and I realize now how unsafe that would be. I never thought something like this could happen. The company is a small startup with no HR or POSH policies, and I don’t trust anyone there to help me. I’m terrified he might use these photos to blackmail me, and I don’t believe he will delete them as he claims. I’m also scared that pursuing legal action might provoke him to distribute the photos, which I desperately want to avoid.\n\nI do have recordings of our conversation because my phone automatically records calls from unsaved numbers. This situation has left me shaken, and I just can’t stop thinking about it. I need advice on what to do next.",

        "text": "Hello, this is my first time posting here. Me and my friends are right now in a very troublesome situation. We are college students, in our 5th semester, and we organised an event to welcome our juniors who joined our department this year. For this event we ordered food in bulk from a restaurant which is around 30mins away from our venue. Till the day of the event the owner told us to receive the food at around 12:30 in the afternoon but on the day of the event he suddenly changed it to 11:30. One friend of ours was supposed to go get the food using a cab. He was late because we were not prepared to go one hour early on that short notice. He reached there at around 12:00 - 12:15, took some time to load the food on our AC cab and brought back the food. We started distributing the food packets after 20-30mins after he arrived at our venue with them. That would be around 2:00PM - 2:10PM. Immediately people complained that the food was spoiled. And they were right. It was extremely spoiled. Panicking we looked for alternatives and ordered the same thing from Swiggy in bulk. When we finished ordering and apologising to everyone we called the owner and he shrugged if off saying \"I was there when everything was made\", then he called his chef, he recorded the call and sent us that recording. Basically he said \"I have everything to prove that I sent fresh food, I don't know how you guys handled it\" pointing the blame to us. We spent double the original money to get everything settled. Later at night we asked for a refund and coincidentally he started receiving bad reviews on Google Maps Businesses, Zomato, Swiggy. He related that with us saying \"Either you get the refund or you can keep on posting bad reviews\". We told him that untill further discussion we won't post anything but if this doesn't get settled the only way we as mere college students can take some action is post reviews letting everyone know about our experience. But the reviews didn't stop as we the organizing team can't control all the 100+ guests. On total till now there are maximum 12-15 reviews spread across various apps (5-6 on Maps, 2-3 on Zomato as far as I know). He's now threatening us with legal action saying that we have been mentally harassing him with all the planned \"fake\" reviews and defaming his restaurant on the internet. It's way more complicated than this but then writing everything down will take me a full day. Please give us advice on what should we do and you need clarification on any part, I will try to fulfil that as much as I can.\n\nEdit: The owner has asked us to arrange a meeting where he will bring his lawyer.\n\nUPDATE: we got a call recording between the chef and the restaurant owner where they are openly claiming that the rice being used was from the last night saying \"when we took out the rice from the refrigerator it was still intact\"\n\nis it usual for restaurants to use rice from previous nights for bulk orders? can we go forward with this point against the owner?\n\n\nUPDATE 2: we had the meeting today (23rd Aug), we went with one of our friend's relative who's a lawyer, he helped a ton, the owner actually brought his own lawyer as well although the lawyer didn't say anything during our discussion. finally we came to the conclusion that he'll try to make amends, although he hasn't declared how much he'll be paying back yet but we are right now at a higher ground.\n\nthanks a ton for all your suggestions and advice, it really helped, you have no idea how much you guys boosted our confidence.\n\nthanks again :)",

Now refusing to move out even after so many instances - I'm unable to look after son peacefully.Husband being disrespectful towards mother, comparing me and SIL and telling mother to teach me about living together with inlaws etc while SIL and husband itself staying away from inlaws separately.\n\nRecently came to know that husband hid a major fact from me: his sister had eloped with someone, but the family brought her back, claiming it was a result of black magic, and few years later she married someone else thru AM. Husband completely hid this fact and i feel betrayed - he still has not confessed this.not against my SIL in this regard, but mentioning this to check whether this will be considered as hiding facts before marriage.\n\nAfter multiple attempts, husband refusing to move out, saying to ignore MIL - but I'm unable to.husband is refusing counselling also.\n\nMy question is based on the above facts, would i be able to get full custody of my son in a contested divorce? I need no alimony or maintenance, but just full custody- as long as I'm in india husband will be visiting but I'm planning to move abroad, hence the ask for full custody.\n\nNote:\n1.i didn't state all facts for sympathy, i'm sure i would have done some mistakes too - i wanted to know the validity of a contested divorce based on these facts.\n\n2. Husband & family didn't ask for any dowry.\n\n3.No physical abuse involved. \n\nThanks in advance.",

We bought a house 2 years ago for which I paid 90% down payment but house is both our names. Mortgage payments is being done by both of us equally till date. \nI came to India with our 1.5 year old daughter, 2 months ago. Now husband wants to divorce me. Since I moved to Canada only for him, I don’t want to go back to Canada now since he is divorcing me. \nHe said he doesn’t want to pay monthly child support which court would order since there’s no guarantee I would spent it on her. Rather he wants me to discuss every expense I would have for her and then he would pay half of those. He also believes those expenses doesn’t include rent since anyway I am not going to pay extra for her. \nRegarding the house, if we sell the house, is there a way for me get more money since I paid almost entire down payment and till date he has only paid 50% of mortgage? What about the furniture in the house? He wants to keep it all  without paying me anything.\nIs it better to file divorce in India or Canada?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all your replies. Many of you suggested going back to Canada. If I go and file divorce there, it’s very likely court would order 50-50 custody which would mean I would be stuck in Canada. I don’t want to live next 16 years of my life in a country I don’t like it live in, that’s my concern. He wasn’t a great father when we were together also and he told many times he will remarry and have children soon. So living in Canada doesn’t look like a good option for my daughter either.",

But I’m not sure how to take action.\n\nHere’s what I want to know:\n\n1. Can I ask my employer to delete my personal data or stop this level of monitoring?\n2. Is it possible to file a complaint with an authority, or do I need to go to court?\n3. Has anyone here dealt with something similar? If yes, what worked for you?\n\nI’m considering seeking legal advice, but I want to understand my options first.

        "text": "I never thought I’d have to write something like this, but here we are. I need advice and support, and most importantly, I want to raise awareness about **food-based discrimination in schools**.\n\n# What Happened?\n\nMy **5-year-old son**, who attends **Global Indian International School (GIIS) in Ahmedabad**, was **forced to sit in a corner alone** during lunch because he had a **boiled egg in his tiffin/lunchbox**.\n\nHis class teacher told him that **his food was “unhealthy”**, while the rest of the class—**all vegetarian children** (claimed by the teacher)—sat together and ate. This **wasn't an accident**. It has happened before, but this time, our son finally spoke up because **he couldn’t take it anymore**.\n\nImagine a young child, excited for lunch, only to be **isolated and shamed for something as simple as eating an egg.**\n\n# The Bigger Issue – Psychological Impact on My Son\n\n* **He now thinks eating eggs is bad.** He came home and asked us, *“Papa, why do I eat unhealthy food?”*\n* **Other kids have started bullying him.** Since the teacher segregated him, classmates have started seeing him as “different.”\n* **He felt punished for something completely normal.** At five years old, he is **questioning himself, his food, and even our parenting.**\n\nThis is **not just about my child**—this kind of **subtle discrimination** can create **deep psychological scars** in kids at such a young age.\n\n# Our Complaint to the School – The Director’s Shocking Response\n\nWe officially complained to the school and met with the **director**—expecting them to listen, apologize, and correct this unacceptable behavior. Instead, we were met with **aggression and dismissal.**\n\n* The **school has NO official policy banning eggs or non-vegetarian food.**\n* The **school director admitted** that there’s no complaint from other parents about our son eating eggs.\n* But then, **he doubled down**, saying *\"If you continue sending eggs, your son will continue to sit alone.\"*\n* His **excuse?** *“Be sensitive! If parents find out that their vegetarian kids are eating next to a child with eggs, they will oppose the school.”*\n* He himself is **a non-vegetarian (a Christian), yet he was enforcing this “rule” to avoid controversy.**\n\nThis **hypocrisy is infuriating**! If the school truly wanted to **protect \"sensitive\" children**, then:\n\n* Why **aren't Jain kids forced to sit alone** when others eat onions or garlic?\n* Why **aren't lactose-intolerant kids separated** when others drink milk?\n* Why **aren't gluten-free kids sitting in a corner** when wheat is served?\n\n# Food Segregation in Schools – A Dangerous Trend?\n\nThis is **not about vegetarian vs. non-vegetarian**. I **fully respect** vegetarianism and religious food preferences. However, **forcing a child to sit alone** because of his lunch creates **a culture of exclusion** that is dangerous for young minds.\n\nInterestingly, **some schools in Tamil Nadu serve eggs in mid-day meals** to ensure children get proper nutrition. If government schools can accept eggs, why is a so-called “international” school in Ahmedabad discriminating against it?\n\n# What We Are Doing Next\n\n1. **We have filed an official complaint** with the **CBSE Board** and the **Gujarat Education Department** via the PG Portal.\n2. **We will take this issue to social media** to create awareness about food-based discrimination in schools.\n3. **We are considering legal action**, as this is **a clear violation of a child’s rights** under the Right to Education (RTE) Act.\n\n# How Can You Help?\n\n* **Have you faced similar issues in Indian schools?** Please share your experiences.\n* **How should we push back legally?** Any lawyers or activists willing to guide us?\n* **Should we take this to the media?** Would this help create enough noise to hold the school accountable?\n\nWe are a **truly international family**—my wife is **American/Cuban**, and we have **always embraced diversity**. We never judge what others eat or believe in. But what happened to our son is **not okay**.\n\nNo child should be **isolated and humiliated** for eating something that is **not banned and is completely normal in millions of Indian households.**\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

The caretaker, a man named Saleh Ahmed, was polite, and we even offered him food during our stay.\n\nOn January 14th, the day of our checkout, we left the room at 11 AM but kept our luggage at the hotel since our bus back was at 9 PM. The hotel has a common washroom on the ground floor connected to the caretaker's quarters. Before heading out to explore Mapusa, I went to the washroom to change.\n\nLater, my friend went to use the same washroom, and that’s when everything went wrong. She came out crying, visibly shaken, and told me Saleh Ahmed had been peeping at her through the washroom window. I was furious and immediately called the Anjuna Police Station.\n\nThe police arrived quickly and took Saleh Ahmed into custody. Shockingly, the hotel owner tried to bribe us to withdraw the FIR. All the washroom windows in the hotel were connected to a passage, making it easy for someone to spy.\n\nThis incident happened yesterday (January 14th) at around 7:15 PM. I’ve been trying to get a copy of the FIR, but the police keep telling me that the server is down. Can someone guide me on how to escalate this or ensure I get the FIR?\n\nMy friend is traumatized by the incident, and it’s heartbreaking to see her go through this. I feel responsible for choosing this hotel, which turned what should have been a relaxing vacation into a nightmare.\n\nI’m sharing this to warn others: Do not book rooms at Hotel Vibes Inn in Nagoa, Goa. You never know who might be watching.\n\nWe’re pursuing this case legally because no one should have to experience this violation of privacy and trust. Please stay safe, and if anyone has advice on how to handle the delay in obtaining the FIR, I’d greatly appreciate your help.\n\nEdit 1: Thank you so much, everyone, for the support.

I leave my job just before the judge ruling. I declare bankruptcy. I got nothing on paper to show that I have money. How much would the judge ask me to pay? And can they know if I have some crypto investments?\n\n5) I convert to Islam or become a Buddhist monk or a Sadhu. What would judge do in that case?\nIf Judge says I still need to pay. I'll simply say, I will but I first need to complete my SADHANA of Lord Shiv or I pull some Islamic sharia law.

But If you are anyway on the verge of committing s*cide, nothing seems like a bad route.\n\nIf someone genuinely tries to pull off one of these scenarios what's the WORST that can happen to that person legally. \n",

Well, okay. Assuming it is true, fine. \nBUT. \nThey have CLEARLY CUT SO MUCH MORE THAN NECESSARY. TREES THAT DID NOT EVEN HAVE ANY BRANCHES TOUCHING OR NEAR THE WIRES HAVE BEEN CUT DOWN. \nI spoke to the people cutting it down and they said that some was for the MCF work, but the society families have also come and requested them to cut extra without telling anyone. \n\nWhat can I do here? \n\nIt's painful to see. It's so incredibly wrong. 20+ years of strong, beautiful, lush green trees just cut down.

They neither helped nor offered me an alternate flight.\n\nAir India's call support admitted the overbooking error but was unhelpful. This ordeal caused me financial loss, stress, and humiliation. I had to shell out another 15k booking an Indigo flight since it was a clost friends' wedding I did not want to miss.\n\nThe lack of accountability and basic customer service was shocking.

        "text": "I purchased an Unacademy VIP subscription in morning of feb 21 paying ₹12,000 via UPI. I confirmed with salesperson that batch will work on my ipad and will be activated immediately after money is paid. After the payment, I received the invoice, but my batch was not activated. I placed countless calls to customer support, but there was no proper response. More than 24 hours later, on Feb 22(next day) evening, after multiple escalations, they finally activated my batch. \n\nOnce the batch was activated, I realized that the course was not working on my iPad(my primary device, Playback issues) When I contacted support again provided them with all the proofs, tried troubleshooting, nothing worked then they casually told me to use an Android device, which is completely unreasonable because I did not pay ₹12,000 to be forced to watch lectures on a phone.\n\nI posted about it on twitter tagging them. Later that evening, a support representative called me again. They cancelled my ICONIC subscription, which was bundled with VIP, and told me that I would be refunded. But after that no follow ups about refund, neither in return about it. Now, my ICONIC subscription is cancelled, but my VIP subscription remains active.\n\nAnother major issue is that the teachers in this batch had clearly stated that they would not be accepting students after Feb 15 because the coursework is too intensive, and it would be difficult for new students to catch up. I agree with this, yet the salesperson still sold me this batch on Feb 21, knowing I would struggle. Now, the teachers are saying that new students should just watch recorded lectures instead of attending live ones to have understanding of whats going on in class. The whole USP of this course was personal attention and live classes peer to peer. So after all this hassle, I am now being forced to pay ₹12,000 just for recorded content. The salesperson told me a complete different story. \n\nI have already filed a complaint with cybercrime and raised a grievance with Unacademy, to which they responded they will try to fix for ipad. (no dead line, no statement addressing the refund which was my main concern). I agree I have been naive here and shouldn’t have trusted sales people. I don’t know what my next step should be. What legal action can I take in this situation? I have my JEE Advanced in 80 days and all this is so mentally taxing. \n\n",

Got a call today from police station to come with my passport. \n\n\nLong version:\nWe were married for 4 years. It was an arranged marriage. They are from outskirts of Mumbai (Ambernath) while I stay in the suburbs (Malad). Wife and her family were always dominating. I pushed back on nonsense demands like international vacation every quarter, suv to be purchased to visit grocery market etc. They always wanted me to shift to their house in Ambernath which I refused. She never wanted to hire a maid for household chores and expected me to do it since her father used to do it at their place. I pleaded with her to hire one since the house was getting dirty but she and her family refused stating security issues and things getting stolen. She has a permanent WFH role while I have a 5 day WFO role. I earn 2x her salary. Things were not rosy, but under control for the initial 2 years.\n\nThe behavior changed when my daughter was conceived. She immediately went to her home stating I don't give her enough time and stayed there for 18 months. I that time period I used to visit her twice a month. They used to pester me to shift permanently to their place which I declined again and again.\n\nWe had a lot of counselling from family members and she finally moved back in after 18 months. We hired a full time maid to take care of the house chores. She moved out after 2 months stating vaccination reasons and only came back to collect her jewelry. On the advice of my cousin who is currently separated from his wife we hired a videographer to record her act of removing jewelry from the house.\n\nPost this I immediately contacted my cousins lawyer to file for divorce ( packing and taking away all your belonging was a huge red flag for me). Before I could file, she filed for a complaint at Mahila takrar committee and I got a speed post summoning me in a week. I went with my lawyer and after 2 sessions it was deemed failed during which my divorce petition was filed..\n\nI recently got a call from police station informing me that a complain has been filed against me and my mother and I would be required to go there with my passport. The inspector repeatedly tld me not to worry. I asked the for a copy of the complaint to which I was asked to physically come for the copy. I asked them to send the request via speed post so that I can buy some time to think and discuss. \n\nI'm planning to visit my lawyer once the complaint comes via speed post.

I thought everything was in order—the papers checked out, registration and mutation went smoothly, and government records now officially list me as the owner.\n\nHere’s the situation:\n\nThe land went through three parties:\n\n\t1.\tThe original seller (a relative of my seller), sold the land to my seller.\n\n\t2.\tMy seller sold the land to me.\n\nWhen I bought it, I couldn’t take immediate possession because of the rainy season and an ongoing bajra crop. I agreed to wait until after the harvest (by Diwali). But now, there’s a new harvest, and when I pushed for possession, the seller advised me to bring the police along, raising my suspicions.\n\n**Here’s the bombshell:**\n\nI visited the first seller and found out he was allegedly tricked into selling the ancestral land while drunk. The second party (my seller) apparently paid him for 1 beegha but fraudulently registered 5.25 beegha. Now, the first seller’s underage son is planning to file a legal case, claiming the land cannot be sold without the consent of his mother and siblings.\n\nTo make matters worse, a farmer (known to first party) from an SC/ST community is currently cultivating the land, and I don’t want to escalate the situation for fear of being entangled in harassment cases.\n\n**Current Status:**\n\n\t•\tThe land is in my name but without possession.\n\n\t•\tThe first seller doesn’t have money to buy the land back.\n\n\t•\tMy seller (the second party) is ghosting me and appears to be a serial fraudster.\n\n\t•\tOn first seller's son's behalf, a legal notice has already been sent to his father, my seller (excluding me), and the case is heading to court challenging the sale.\n\n**My Options (as I see them):**\n\n\t1.\t**Wait for a Long Legal Battle:** Respond to the legal notice, deny knowledge of the fraud between the first and second parties, and let the court decide and I stand a chance to loose the land if it remain unconteseted. But this could take years.\n\n\t2.\t**File a Case Against 1st Seller, My Seller & SC/ST farmer:** Sue the 1st party & SC/ST farmer for not allowing me to take land pocession & second party for fraud to recover at least the DLC (documented) amount, which is about 1/3rd of the actual money I paid.\n\n\t3.\t**Leave the Land in Status Quo:** Keep ownership on paper but avoid possession, which means I’ll bear financial loss while the land remains in limbo.\n\nI can’t sell the land ethically, knowing its legal complications, and I don’t want another innocent buyer to face the same ordeal.\n\nWhat would you do in my shoes? Is there a better legal or practical option I haven’t considered? Any advice on navigating this mess?",

I never asked him for a penny knowing about his situation. Still most of the time he threatened me to slap me and disrespected me almost everyday. His mother always interferes in our marriage, I have lower back issues, I asked him let's clean the bathroom pot one by one , for which he denied. I got sick, my left hand got injured entirely, entire plate of food fell on the ground. Still he never cleaned it up. I have done it using my single hand. No care, love or empathy because his mother always manipulates him saying that I treat him like a servant if he's helping me in household chores. So, I am not getting anyhelp at all , no matter if I am sick or dying. He never offered a glass of water to me. He used to help in everything,but his mother belittled him saying that I treat her son as a servant. \nMIL watches serial for the entire day, she over exaggerates everything happening in the household for FIL who doesn't live with us because he's in force. If I am removing something from the room, she will say she is throwing our stuff, for every possible thing she over exaggerates it like anything. \nRecently they planned to shift, and forcing me to live with them. When I said no, my husband said then it will be a end of our relationship. To which I agreed saying that we will accept that this was it, but once again I can't place myself in that toxic environment, where your parents will again make me depressed and suicidal. It's very hard to build yourself from scratch again, I lost myself completely during those times. \nYesterday my in laws came to my house saying that they are here for the discussion and to take me back. My husband was sitting inside the car , he refused to come upstairs , when my parents asked ? His parents said it's our decision that he won't come. Entire discussion went on without him being there, although he came along with them . I was shocked to know that he told him parents that he was paying the rent and everything not me . I got know that entire and everything was a lie, he was lying to me on everyday basis, saying that he was doing everything here on his expenses. He took my jwellery saying that his father's salary will be on hold due to lien. MIL was gone along with him to place my jwellery in muthoot finance. For which he said that I asked him to do that, and if he won't agree then I'll create a scene. His mother is extremely greedy, always asking for money or gold. Since day 1 she was asking for my gold, and dowry as well. \nI am in utter shock because I got know ,my husband is the biggest liar and scammer. These people aren't agreeing for divorce. It's not been a year so, we can't file for it as well. Another 6 months are still left. I made my decision not to live with these people on any condition. I am planning to shift and to live alone. But I don't know how to deal with this situation, as I don't have a father and my brother lives outside India. I don't want to burden my Mother, she's above 63 . She's supporting my decision. But mentally since yesterday, everything this shattered. I don't know what to do ? ",

I haven't dropped an email, however, I have whatsapp messages of cancelling the order. \n\nHowever, even after that, they did not cancel my subscription and kept advising me to transfer it and they did not send any representative to my address and did not bother contacting me for a pick up.

I arranged for it, contacted the customer care and asked them to take the unit but I did not recieve any communication from the pick up agent which I was told I would receive one. \n\nAfter 3 months I get a threating call from 'Legal team' who was extremely rude and basically demanded me to return the unit. I told them I would not be able to do it anymore and that the least I can do is give them the house owners number, which I did.

        "text": "Iam facing a situation where the zeal to work hard is dying. the cumulative tax burden on our income and spendings is unfair. Initially, our income is significantly reduced by income tax, and on top of that, we do not receive any GST exemption on the goods and services we purchase or sell, leading to a scenario of double taxation. I want to understand the legal basis for challenging this issue and explore all possible arguments and examples that justify this appeal to the Supreme Court against the tax authority.\n   \nStraightforward this is totally unfair that sometimes we’ve to pay 18-27% on gst on an income which is already taxed heavily without any guarantees and benefits.\n   \nAnd finally after everything you want to have some world class stuff to make this life less miserable we’ve to pay custom duties on it.\n  \n\nIn summary, I am seeking a legal remedy that calls upon the Supreme Court to direct the tax authority to modify the taxation mechanism, where the tax payers get some sort of relief somewhere. This would include reconsidering the current framework under GST in light of income tax liabilities, or make some relaxation in custom duties, or make the tax like toll, road substantially reduced or something in similar front. thus ensuring that my effective tax burden does not amount to a double taxation scenario. My ultimate goal is to achieve a balanced and equitable tax system that aligns with constitutional principles and promotes a fair environment.",

What are our legal options to deal with a defaulting tenant who refuses to vacate?\n2. Can we file an eviction case due to non-payment of rent despite having a fixed-term agreement?\n3. What is the fastest legal recourse available in Mumbai for such cases?\n4. Should we approach civil court or rent control authority given that police intervention has failed?\n5. Does the registration status of the agreement affect our legal options?\n\nAdditional Information:\n- We have documentation of the initial payments\n- We've attempted to communicate with the tenant regarding the pending rent\n- Police intervention has been unsuccessful\n- We're now looking for proper legal recourse as our only option\n\nAny advice on the legal steps we should take would be greatly appreciated, particularly from those familiar with Mumbai rental laws. We want to handle this situation legally and properly. ",

        "title": "I think I got myself into a huge financial and legal mess. Please help me urgent.",
        "text": "What happened:\n\nI was added to some whatsapp group which apparently gives stock advice. The moderator introduced themselves as from \"HSBC Securities\". I waited for a few days to see what's happening. There is a moderator called \"Rajiv Jain\" in the group that everyone calls \"Professor\". He tells which stocks to buy and sell. The weird thing is that he advices Upper Circuit stocks and \"Block trades\". If you know anything about stocks, you would know that you can't purchase Upper circuit stocks. And block trades are just direct discount on stocks! He says to buy them and sell next day. All the shares are held 1 day, some special trades two days. They emphasize to sell on time and not hold as it is against rules. This is what they say \"Please buy today and sell after the opening of the next trading day. It is strictly forbidden to expand profits. Once illegal operations are found, they will be blacklisted and all cooperation will be terminated\". So how do you participate in these trades? You need to open a \"Primary Market account\" with them it seems and download their app. \n\nNow I did something really stupid, I know. I went ahead, gave them my PAN card, Aadhaar card and downloaded their app from a direct link (not on playstore). So I transfer them 1.75 Lakh (over days and over multiple transactions). Let me tell you how these transactions worked. You contact Customer support (another whatsapp group). You tell them how much you want to transfer and they tell you which bank account to transfer to. The bank accounts change every time because there is a 100 crore limit on them and they need to change accounts every time it seems. They are never HSBC banks, some small banks accounts.\n\nThe amount is reflected in the app. Let me tell you about the app. It looks like a legit app, you can see the live stock prices (though they seem to update slowly like every 5 mins). When you buy the stocks, even UC, you are immediately granted the stock and sale is also immediate. There is no setting of buy/sell price, always market. For a few days, I followed the trades, made money on the app. The process of withdrawal is to put a withdrawal request and they will either approve/reject it. To test whether withdrawals are working, I withdrew 1000 Rs, it went fine. Few days later, I withdrew 40k, it also worked fine. So my confidence has grown a bit that this might be legit.\n\nNow, here are the reasons why this sounded legit. All the members on the app are always positive, there is never a negative message, everyone is praising, posting screenshots of their trades, of their profits, of how much they deposited. There are a 100 members in the group. I think it is difficult to have this many co conspirators. At least 20 to 30 different people chat in the group actively. But some people were randomly removed from the group too, don't know why. And people were posting screenshots and physical receipts of bank transfers for tens of lakhs of rupees. This moderator Rajiv Jain explained what primary account is, why they are able to get block trades (discounted stock) - as they negotiate with companies - apparently the shareholder are unable to sell on market as that would cause stock crash, so they sell to us at discount it seems (But what was the point if we sell the next day anyway). He also daily explains different concepts and during budget, he gave some insights, so they are at least  very knowledgeable about financials. They also provided a SEBI registration number: INZ000234533. But there were some suspicious things too. Like the discounts are huge. Initially they started at 6%-7%. Later, 10%, 22%, and recently, 33% discount. All big names, ICICI Lombard - 39% discount, ICICI securities - 51% dicount, HDFC - 33% discount. But you need to buy minimum of 10L to 1 crore for some of them. \n\nWhere I got screwed hard: So the third type of trades they do is IPO trading. I was told to apply IPO for Quality Power Electrical Equipment Ltd. Well, I did that. I went to the IPO page, clicked on apply, Weirdly, there is no bidding amount, how many share, nothing. I just got a screen saying submitted. I didn't think much of it. Now 2 days back, I get a message from customer support saying I won the IPO allotment, and I was allotted 2700 shares at 10.8 Lakh rupees. I don't have that much money in that app. I open the app to see my money is zero (All 2 Lakh I had was paid for the IPO it seems). I tell them I can't pay that amount. They reply: \"Hello, according to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) \"Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements (ICDR) Regulations, 2018\", after the IPO allotment is completed, the allotted investors must pay the full amount according to the allocated amount, otherwise they may face risks such as account freezing and future IPO subscription restrictions.\" I had one day to make payment, I obviously didn't do it.\n\nI registered a cyber crime complaint on 1930 (2 days back).. They took details of my transactions. I get this weird message from cyber cell today: \"Dear Sir/ Madam, Status of your Complaint Acknowledgement No. (redacted), dated 19/02/2025, reported on Cyber Crime portal is amount of Rs. 655 has been Put on Hold. Kindly contact your respective Police Station. Regards, National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal.\" What? Why was my money put on hold? I go to police station, they say to get print out of the cyber crime complaint, but I don't see any option to get print out of my submitted complaint. Have to go again tomorrow to resolve.\n\nThings got worse: Tonight, I get this message: Since you have not completed the IPO subscription, in order not to affect the listing of the stock, we have repurchased your account. The repurchase terms are as follows:\n\n1. If you are temporarily unable to pay the IPO subscription funds, HSBC Securities will repurchase\n\n2. Since you violated the regulations, your credit score will drop to 75 points after the repurchase, and it can be restored after completing the repayment\n\n3. If you complete the payment within 5 working days, there will be no additional fees. If it exceeds 5 working days, interest will be adjusted according to the current interest rate\n\nThis is very scary if real. I asked for where are the terms and conditions? They just send me pics of some documents (which look legit) but they refuse to send online link as apparently there is no such link. I ask for speaking to management or asking for office address. They say they do everything online and I can't meet management as it is not feasible.\n\nConclusion I made. This is either a fully scam operation and they are scaring me into sending more money or they are some legitimate financial institution with someone doing illegal activities. If it is the latter - It is really HSBC Securities who are essentially creating false loans with terms and conditions I didn't accept, I think I am royally F\\*\\*\\*ED\n\nI am planning on going to police station again and also go to local HSBC branch to maybe find some answers. If anyone has any advice, please suggest. I know I did stupid things.",

Now I moved back to a development project where I am well recieved and I was trying for a promotion and now the talent team of the company raised another IAP because they feel my ratings are low which offcourse they will be due to 2 back to back IAPs. I feel like firm is trying push me out, offcourse the best course will be to leave it but is there something I can do legally regarding this miss management? ",

        "text": "As the title said, I hired this firm to apply for a visa for my spouse and myself, bust despite constant reminders on a day to day basis the female in the agency kept saying the website was down, which was quite suspicious it had been 6 days since the payment had been made for their services. I tried to book an appointment myself and was successful and I questioned the lady regarding the same and she pretended saying I dont know why its not working for me! I excused her for it and asked her to continue with the rest of the processes and she agrees. She comes back to me the next day saying \"what about the documentation(flights and stay)\" and I said it was communicated to me prior to making your service fee payment that all of this would be taken care of. She went ahead and checked and got back to me saying that it indeed is not covered. At this point Im furious and I asked her what are we paying you 20k for if I have to be behind you for everything and I need to pay an additional amount to get you to do the documentation. She did not have a response.  Later that evening a guy from the same firm called and agreed that there has been a mishap from their end and they are ready to do the process \"free of charge\" (apart from the 20k already paid). I had 0 confidence in their capabilities and refused their service and demanded a refund, he assured me Id get it in 30 days. After 10 days I receive an email from them stating that I need to sign a letter for my refund which stated\n\n*I agree to your following terms and request to initiate the refund amount:*\n\n*1) After refund, there will be no follow ups or call back from the Sandpiper team with regards to*\n\n*my application process*\n\n*2) As I have not availed the complete PR Visa assistance from Sandpiper Visas, neither I or my*\n\n*family won’t give any negative or positive feedback in any of the social media platforms or*\n\n*Google my business listing reviews*\n\n*3) It is entirely my decision and I am opting for this refund*\n\n*4) The following account number is mine and request to initiate the refund over there*\n\n*5) I understand refund time frame is maximum 30 days*\n\n*Account Holder Name -*\n\n*Account Number -*\n\n*Account IFSC Code -*\n\n*Bank Name -*\n\n*Branch Location -*\n\n*Kindly do the needful.*\n\n*Thanks \\&amp; Regards,*\n\n  \nI objected to the 2nd point and stated its not fair to my right as a consumer to agree to the second point and I must be able to give you my review based on the service you have provided me.

When he hid my eyes and enjoyed himself, with his mouth on my breasts, I froze in Fear—I couldn’t move or react, Like a Dead Body I froze (trauma response) He didn’t care if I’m Okay, if I’m comfortable, absolutely Nothing, My eyes were hidden and he did it……. Then, I fawned (which is trauma response)—hugging and kissing him, trying to find comfort, safety, and trust in an unsafe situation. And again I froze when he kept his mouth on my breasts. I questioned him the next day that why he forced me, and he admitted that he forced me knowingly ( but he said it wasn’t preplanned and he did it on the moment, Anga yaara eruinthalum apditha agi erukum, his words were, any man would have done the same in that place, such a disgust comment ( what was I an Object ?, that’s how it felt ), He excused himself with his words “I did you wrong but I’m not a wrong man” “why did you allow me to your home”.\n\nEven If it wasn’t my home, it would’ve still happened to me in any other day, at any other place, at any other time. It doesn’t have to be my home at night. The least respectful thing, he could’ve done is value my NO, but to him, “his desire” felt more important than my consent and comfort. \n\nEven though he admitted to forcing me but then he shifted blame and avoided accountability and said, \"At least you should have stayed in control.\" ( I told him I feel unsafe and I wanted to be alone, rather than addressing my feelings of unsafety, this was his opportunity to say “Ennakum thaniya tha erukanum nu thonuthu”, He betrayed me in days shortly afterwards, like use and discard ). Days before this incident, at his home during day time, he tried to remove my top by force, I said NO, he tried to remove it again, I held it tight so he stopped, he said to me, It must’ve triggered ur past trauma, I won’t ever do like that again. I thought what a good man, I trusted him and respected him enough to allow him to my home, when he asked me if he can visit mine, but now as he got awareness that removing it on his own despite NO, is clear violation, he coerced me by consistently pressuring me into it….\n\nHis Friends made excuses for his actions and invalidated me saying, “Forcing is wrong but it’s not preplanned, it’s situational and another one said, he must’ve had different intentions.” \n\nHe admitted that he did not Love me and he made false promises of marriage recklessly. The fawning and freezing was trauma response. Fawning was my brain, trying its best to find comfort and safety in him, after freezing where I went absolutely Frozen, unable to move. ( Him repeatedly ignoring my NO caused me to relive flashbacks of my past SA from Childhood, I had Flashbacks of it, when he repeatedly ignored my NO that is how much he forced me). It hurts a lot the trauma, Couldn’t express in words, it’s been months, He is Ex Boyfriend.\n\nIs this legally considered as a crime, in India \nBut I feel like I’d probably be victim blamed. \nJust cause I trusted him to Allow him to my home, doesn’t mean I owed him Sex / Sexual Activity.\nwe both mutually agreed on our Limits, from the beginning of relationship. \n",

        "text": "My friend applied for his passport renewal over nine months ago through BLS International, as required by Indian embassies abroad. Despite numerous follow-ups, he has only been told that his application is “with the embassy,” with no updates or resolution. Attempts to contact the embassy have gone unanswered, leaving him stuck in limbo.\n\nThis isn’t an isolated case—passport delays disproportionately affect Kashmiri applicants, who often face processing times of 7 months to over a year, compared to the typical 1-2 months for others. Even his initial passport application in Srinagar faced similar delays, pointing to a concerning pattern of systemic discrimination.\n\nThese delays go beyond inconvenience—they’re dangerous. Applicants abroad are required to submit their existing passports, leaving them vulnerable in emergencies, while those applying from within India often miss valuable opportunities due to prolonged delays. This lack of transparency, accountability, and fairness raises serious concerns and may violate fundamental rights under Articles 14 and 15 of the Indian Constitution, which guarantee equality and non-discrimination.\n\nHe is seeking legal advice to address this systemic issue, not just for himself but for the many Kashmiris who endure these delays in silence, often out of fear of retaliation. He asked me to post on his behalf as he is apprehensive about drawing attention to himself or his family.\n\nAny advice on legal recourse, relevant laws, or organizations that could assist would be immensely helpful. \n\nThank you for your time and support!\n\n",

Little did he know that the auction of the property fetched an additional sum of say X lakh rupees. \n\nHe raised an ombudsman complaint following which they credited the amount to his savings account with HDFC Bank. By now, the merger had taken place and now the bank has put a hold on this amount saying they will remove the hold only if he pays back the credit card outstanding which has now ballooned to 4X lakh rupees. \n\nMy question is, does the bank have the right to put hold on a sum which is the proceeds of a property auction to offset the dues of a credit card, which is an unsecured loan? Essentially what the bank did here is treat this credit card like a mortagage loan, which is not fair. \n\nHe desparately needs this sum to stay afloat and he doesn't have a stable job yet. Is there anyway he can get this amount from the bank and restructure his credit card dues into an EMI?",

At the very least, they should help bring closure to the case, such as through a successful settlement. What is this mockery?\n\nSo many people like us are spending their hard-earned money on lawyers like these, only for the case to drag on for years. It really boils my blood. What incentive do lawyers have these days?

        "text": "Hello everyone. I’m a final-year law student based in NCR, and I feel compelled to share the struggles that many young advocates and law students are currently facing.\n\nThroughout my internships in various courts and with different lawyers, I've observed a troubling trend. Senior lawyers often delegate their drafting and research tasks to junior advocates, yet when it comes time to compensate them, they expect them to work without pay.\n\nJunior advocates typically earn between 5,000 to 15,000 rupees a month while being expected to put in 12-hour workdays. \nInterns are not even paid that.\n\nI recognize that internships are primarily for learning, and I don’t expect to be paid right away. However, when we seek guidance on legal matters beyond our assigned cases, many lawyers dismiss our inquiries, claiming it’s not their responsibility. It often feels like we are treated more like servants than interns.\n\n\nPERSONAL EXPERIENCE:  I’m currently studying on an education loan and have been interning for a month with an advocate in Delhi. I took this internship believing it would offer valuable litigation experience, especially since my college assured me it came with a 6,000-rupee stipend. This amount would have been sufficient to cover my rent and food expenses for a month. So, I joined the internship right away on 15 Jan.\n\nTomorrow is the final day of my internship so today I asked the advocate under whom I was interning about my stipend. He immediately declined to pay me, saying, \"KARA HI KYA HAI YAHA TUMNE?\" \n\nI explained how diligently I worked, met all deadlines, and prepared drafts. I even shared my financial struggles and told him that I rely on the stipend to cover my essential living expenses, but he still declined to compensate me.\nI was left speechless, on the brink of tears. I could not believe how someone could be so cruel.\n\nGuys, believe me, this profession is harsh and unforgiving, with individuals who seem more interested in exploiting youngsters rather than nurturing them.\nI urge anyone considering a career in law, especially those from first-generation backgrounds, to ensure that you are financially secure because people here will leave no stone unturned to exploit your misery.\n\nPLEASE SHARE THIS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE",

        "text": "Before you leave comments like 'you are a shitty cousin, your family is toxic, etc' I would like to point out that my family is not on talking terms with them for decades as they were always problematic. This post is to help others going through a separation and to know what to expect legally and socially.\n\nMy cousin, 31M is from a wealthy family. His father started a real estate business and their net worth is around 70-85cr. They started looking for a bride for 3 years when he was 28-29 and they found nobody. Reasons - he found the women too modern, and high maintenance and the women who wanted to be homemakers still wanted a maid and cook. Eventually, the family changed their strategy to looking for girls from small towns/villages. He married a 21-year-old who was straight out of college. Reasons - innocent, middle class, has no career aspirations, fair and slim. During the wedding my aunt actively went around bitching about this girl to close relatives that her father didn't have anything to give them, dowry basically and that they were forced to make the marriage happen because my cousin was getting old.\n\nFor the next 3 years of their marriage, they lived together since it was already agreed upon at the time of marriage that living separately was not an option since his parents pay all the bills. They expected her to cook despite them being rich enough to afford a maid. They would complain that she is using their money to pay for her expenses, they were expecting her parents to give her money. They didn't see why she should have a job as they didn't need her money. After 1 year of the marriage, they started forcing her to pregnant, this was including the husband.\n\nThis was going on for 3 years. This year she informed her parents and they stepped in and asked her to adjust. When she said she is going to walk out they finally decided to have a divorce conversation with the family. The family has assured everything is in their name and not the son's name so nothing will be given to her. I also know they are **hiding how much property they own** as they have always used all the tricks in the book to acquire more property over the years. When it comes to alimony their reasoning was he gets paid from the company so only that is counted(it's a 50k range salary) and they are also refusing to give the divorce because they don't want to lose any of their wealth. The poor girl is stuck with a toxic family and her family trying to make her adjust as this family is refusing to proceed with the divorce. Lastly, to make their case better, my cousin's family is going around telling all our relatives that she is bipolar and that they have been cheated.\n\nWhen you decide to walk out, check everything secretly, gather funds and then get a good lawyer as soon as possible!",

Now, PayPal requires a business account to receive payments so I had opted for AirTM. I received payouts in the form of USDC, but the issue is the conversion into INR.\n\nNow, there are 500 ways AirTM enables us to do so, but all of them seem fishy because they involve some form of Peer-to-Peer(P2P) activity. Is there no foolproof way to achieve this? I have no qualms at all about the taxes, just the conversion process. \n\nFor reference, a payment method is listed as PhonePe, where you're connected to an \"AirTM verified cashier\" who sends the asked amount to your PhonePe through UPI, and when you confirm the received payment, AirTM deducts that amount from your account and passes it onto the cashier. \n\nSimilar methods include P2P transfer to Indian Banks(NEFT), PayTM etc. There's a lucrative option of Amazon Gift card where someone purchases a gift card on your behalf and shares you the code so that you can add it to your account, but then, wouldn't it be a direct evasion of taxes?\n\nMy ask is, what should be the steps now? Do I give up the amount I have in AirTM(with a heavy heart of course, but I can do that)? or is there any legal way to convert it into INR? or what?\n\nI'd appreciate if the solutions revolve around the current scenario, rather than asking me to opt for PayPal.

        "text": "We are a young couple in our early 30s from Bangalore. Building our own house was a dream, and three years ago, we bought a plot with a loan from an NBFC (since it has a Panchayat Khata). A 55kV high-tension (HT) wire runs about 10 feet from our site but does not pass directly over it.\n\nAfter registering the plot, we searched for a reputed construction company to build our G+2.5 triplex home, keeping the HT wire in mind. We chose Company X based on their marketing and claimed experience (800 standalone projects completed). The total construction cost was agreed upon, including all taxes, and any extra costs for material changes would be our responsibility.\n\nBoth parties signed an agreement. The company conducted a site analysis, soil test, and feasibility check, confirming that G+2.5 was possible. They committed to completing the project within 12 months and provided a phased timeline. Their payment structure required us to pay only after completing each phase.\n\nInitially, construction progressed, but there were deviations from the approved plan. They assured us these would be fixed later. Then, suddenly, all communication stopped—our site engineer, coordinator, and escalation team ignored our calls for two months. When we visited their office, they claimed workers refused to continue due to the 55kV HT line.\n\nThis was shocking, as they had previously approved the design. After much discussion, we agreed to remove one floor, reducing it to G+1.5, and they resumed work. However, they kept delaying construction, leading to a total delay of six months beyond the agreed timeline.\n\nWhen we confronted the management, they refused to compensate us despite a clause in the agreement stating that delays would make us eligible for compensation. They also ignored our complaints about construction quality. Now, they are demanding additional GST due to miscalculations, even though we had agreed on a GST-inclusive price.\n\nThey still have our money for an unfinished phase and now claim they will complete the project by April, which means an 8-month delay.\n\nHow can we take legal action without spending too much?\n\nSome friends told us that court hearings could cost around ₹35,000 INR per session, which worries us. We want to know our legal options if the work is delayed further or if there are quality issues. Any advice on handling this situation legally and effectively?\n\nTL;DR: Hired a reputed builder for our G+2.5 dream home in Bangalore. They confirmed feasibility, signed a contract, and promised a 12-month timeline. Midway, they stopped responding for two months, citing a 55kV HT line issue (which they knew about earlier). We had to remove a floor (now G+1.5) to resume work. They kept delaying, resulting in a 6-month delay, and now claim it’ll be done by April (8 months late). They refuse compensation, ignore quality concerns, and are demanding extra GST due to their miscalculations. Legal action seems costly—what are our best options as consumers?\n",

In the 6 month relationship, he wasn't supportive, didn't have a stable job, and didn't treat her the way she wanted (she asked to be given flowers on 3 different occasions, even just a 5 rupee rose, or out on a proper date). She comes from an economically difficult family where she takes care of her parents, pays for most of the things in the house including rent. She also took on two jobs. She paid for dates and bought him multiple gifts. He hails from a well to do family and is 31M. Her being 29F she didn't see him step up as a potential partner and ended the relationship when he ghosted her a second time without any information getting angry for a picture with a male friend. She kept calling him to clear the misunderstanding and he refused to pick up. After all this, when she broke up with him and deleted him from her followers, he got might I say, psychopathic. Kept calling her and threatening her to the point where he talked about ruining her image and her life and never letting go and so much more. She lodged a complaint but the police sent him off with a warning and a signed letter. After more than a month she recieves this legal notice. She has proof of all the messages he sent her, even a recording ofa phone call detailing the relationship. What should we do next? He clearly wants to draw this out to hurt her financially and to let her father know since he is abusive. Please help.",

Moreover, I was ready to comply and find a solution but then he sent me a notice for contract compliance.

I terminated my connection months ago, yet I still get **two calls every single day** asking me to renew. I’ve tried everything, but they just won’t stop.\n\nBack in **November 2024**, I was moving out of Bangalore and requested Hathway to **terminate my broadband connection**. I made the request well in advance, but they **never acknowledged it**. My last month in Bangalore, I received calls daily nudging me to renew my plan. I told them that I am not interested and that I'm moving out of Bangalore. I left the router at my old place and moved on, because I had to vacate the place. But starting shortly after, I began getting **daily calls** from different numbers asking me to renew my plan. At first, I politely explained that I had moved and no longer needed their service. That didn’t work. Then I got firm, angry, and even sarcastic, but it **made no difference**—the calls **kept coming, two per day, every single day**.\n\nI have escalated this multiple times over email, contacting their **support, nodal officers, and even CCed the CEO today**. I clearly stated that these calls needed to stop and that if they continued, I would be forced to take legal action. Still, **no response from them, and the calls never stopped**. I even tried **asking the agents on the call to put me on a Do Not Disturb (DND) list**, but every single time I do that, **the call gets abruptly cut off**—almost as if they’ve been instructed to just hang up rather than acknowledge such a request. Blocking numbers is useless because they **keep calling from different ones**. It’s been **over three months**, and this has now gone from annoying to outright **harassment**.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this? What are my options here? Can I take **legal action for harassment**? Are there any **consumer rights organizations** or **regulatory bodies (like TRAI or consumer courts)** that I can escalate this to? I’ve attached **a PDF of my email escalations and a screen recording of my call logs** showing the spam in the first comment below. If anyone has any advice on how to **permanently put an end to this**, I’d really appreciate it.\n\n  \nRelevant screenshots - [https://imgur.com/a/hathway-ZRd6qqI](https://imgur.com/a/hathway-ZRd6qqI)",

Now, her uncle is demanding a divorce and asking for ₹25 lakh. On top of that, they’re threatening my friend and her mom with false accusations of mental harassment and even molestation against her brother, which is completely untrue.\n\nHer family gave my friends family a lumpsum of 1L for getting them whatever furniture they wanted to buy.the family used this money and also some fuel money for their rented car. Now the uncle is threatning us for a dowry case as well saying that they will sue us on a fake case(he admitted this on a call but they didnt record it!)\n\nMy friend is really stressed about all this. She’s planning to pursue her master’s abroad and is worried this situation might affect her future.\n\nIt feels like the wife’s family is just trying to extort money under the guise of a divorce, but these false allegations are seriously concerning.

The employee used my laptop to leave reviews for the service center and accessed my Gmail account, as well as my partner's work email and other accounts. This unauthorized access to multiple accounts constitutes a severe violation of my privacy.  \nDespite the employee's apology, this incident has significantly eroded my trust in Lenovo’s services. I demanded the following compensation:\n\n* An additional two-year extended warranty for my device, specifically Legion Ultimate Support with Accidental Damage Protection.\n* An upgrade for my laptop.\n* A written assurance that my data and privacy will be safeguarded moving forward.\n* Compensation for the breach of sensitive information and the distress caused.\n\nAfter negotiations, Lenovo offered a three-month warranty extension, which I have yet to receive. During a call, the service head at Lenovo downplayed the issue and became rude when I asked for compensation for the time and effort wasted.  \nI am considering reporting this incident to the Cyber Cell in India but would also like to explore legal options.

        "text": "In short, this is what I've been told, though I can't verify its accuracy:\r  \n\r  \nIn 1981, when I was 1 year old and my sister was 4, our mother fell ill in Delhi. The hospital had no space, so we were sent to an orphanage. We stayed there briefly before moving to another nearby orphanage, where we lived for about 6 months. We were then informed that our mother had passed away at the hospital. Subsequently, the orphanage arranged for our adoption, which was approved by the hospital, and we were adopted by a family in Europe 6 months after the death of our mother.\r  \n\r  \nMany years later, in 2022, we began searching for our biological parents. The hospital had no records about our mother, and the orphanage informed us that our father had inquired about us in 2006. There is no evidence confirming whether our mother is alive or deceased. Adding to the uncertainty, adoption papers received this year from my adoptive parents mention my mother's name and  the state that she was reportedly doing \"well\" this was written by the orphanage, which makes me doubt if she really was sick.\r  \nAll of these events unfolded between 1981 and 1982 in the Delhi area. My primary goal is to locate my parents, or at the very least, confirm their status. I am hopeful that there is a way to access government records to help in this search.",

        "text": "It is a long post, please bear with me\n\nMy(M24) grandfather (M84, still alive) owned a property in Koramangala Bangalore, and had a factory on it, for many years, till around the time I was born, when one unfortunate day(it was a few days after I was born), Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) came and demolished it, citing that the land was theirs. The case pertaining to this has been going on for about 24 years now.\n\n Now, let me explain the facts of our case. The property that my grandfather bought, was from a third party person(X). Now, X owned a large piece of land in the area(consisting of about 150 sites, today) which the BDA agreed to buy from him to develop into a layout. There was some advance money transfer as well, and the agreement was signed between X and the BDA to buy the land. But BDA did not go forward with the deal, and there is some law that if the the land is not developed within 15 years by BDA the agreement lapses. The BDA did not do anything for more than 15 years, so X himself divided the land into plots and sold them(this was a clean sale, as many of our lawyers validated). My grandfather was one of those people who bought the plot. We have all documents to prove ownership and my grandfather had paid property tax for years after he bought the land.\n\nNow a few days after I was born, the BDA demolished my grandfather's factory and the neighbour's property citing that the property was theirs. This was an unjust demolition, even if we assume that their claim was true, because out of the 150 sites in the area, they demolished only 2 sites. Later we came to know that the then district collector had some enimity with our neighbour guy, and he wanted to demonstrate his power, so his primary aim was to demolish that person's property, and the demolition of our property was collateral damage. \n\nNext comes the lawyers. After this event my grandfather became nearly bankrupt. He put all his savings into hiring a good lawyer who initially handled the case very well. Right when we were about to win, he absonded. We suspect that he was bought over by the opposition (which were public prosecutors). This also happened with next lawyer that we hired. After that we no longer had the money to hire good lawyers, and all the lawyers we hire initially say that our case is a clean win and then just drag on the case. The case is going on till now.\n\nNow all this while, the high court gave an interim order about 10 years ago, that the BDA allot an alternative site in Bangalore within 3 months of the order to my grandfather to compensate him. Till now the site has not been given by BDA.\n\nAt this point we feel that the entire state apparatus is moving against us. The state has infinite resources to drag the case for eternity, but not us. My grandfather is already 84, feeble and weak and he has no energy, money and time to fight this case. I myself have started earning, but not enough to hire big lawyers. Even if we hire big lawyers, we're scared that they might be bought over. Right now our aim has been to just keep the case alive, hoping that somewhere sometime in the future our destiny would turn. But still, I'm here asking for opinion on what's the best course of action for us to do with this case, to get justice asap, just in case we missed some options we could have taken?",

Currently, due to the involvement of middlemen, the end consumers in urban areas are paying a much higher price for fresh produce, while we, the farmers, are selling them at very low rates. For example, cauliflower is sold at ₹60 per kg in Noida, while we farmers are selling it at ₹2-4 per kg.\n\nI want to bypass the middlemen and sell directly to customers online to ensure a fair price for both parties. However, I’m not sure about the legalities of such an arrangement.

I have **Whatsapp recordings of this conversation.**\n\nHowever, when I recently contacted **Star Health customer care (31 Jan 2025)** to confirm, they escalated me to one of the senior executive one **Ms. Raji**, who told me that **room rent is INCLUDED in the ₹75,000 maternity limit**—meaning if I take a ₹50K room, I’ll only have ₹25K left for delivery expenses.\n\nThis directly **contradicts the policy document**, which states:\n\n* **\"For Sum Insured ₹50,00,000/- and above: Any Room”** (no sub-limits mentioned)\n* **Maternity expenses up to ₹75,000 per delivery** (but no clear mention that room rent is part of this cap)\n* **Room rent is listed under \"Room, Boarding, Nursing Expenses\" as a separate benefit under hospitalization.**\n\n# Possible Misrepresentation?\n\n1. **PolicyBazaar agent gave me incorrect information at the time of purchase.**\n2. **Star Health's policy document does not explicitly mention room rent is deducted from the ₹75K maternity limit.**\n3. **If they enforce this limitation without disclosing it in the policy, could this be considered misrepresentation or an unfair trade practice under IRDAI regulations or the Consumer Protection Act?**\n\n# My Next Steps & Legal Questions\n\n* **Can I file a complaint with IRDAI or the Insurance Ombudsman regarding this discrepancy?**\n* **Does the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 apply here, since I was misled by both PolicyBazaar and Star Health?**\n* **Would this qualify as a breach of contract if the policy doesn’t explicitly state the room rent deduction?**\n* **What legal recourse do I have to ensure they honor the policy as written?**\n\nI am thinking of senting a **formal complaint to Star Health**, demanding a written response within 5 business days, failing which I plan to escalate.\n\nAny insights on how to proceed legally would be greatly appreciated!

They provided full service without making sure the payment was received (they acknowledged 1$ payment but did not ask any further). Also if they want money they should be providing it via their website behind a paywall. Why is transaction happening on WhatsApp \n\n2.

They showed us flats and quoted high prices, demanding brokerage fees. We found a better deal through another broker and paid them instead. This upset the maintenance staff, who felt they'd lost out on the brokerage. Throughout the year, they made life difficult for us.\n\nRecently, our lease ended, and three of my flatmates left. My friend and I wanted to stay, so we asked the owner if we could find new flatmates. She agreed, but the maintenance staff intervened, claiming \"replacements are not allowed\" and that \"co-living\" is not permitted. Their reason is that one of the original flatmates was my friend's sister, and now that she's left, they're citing this as an issue.\n\nHowever, our parents have no problem with our living arrangement, and the owner is also okay with it. In fact, our parents have visited us multiple times without any issues. It's clear that the maintenance staff is selectively targeting us, as there are other bachelors co-living in the society who came through them.\n\nWhen potential new flatmates came to visit, security stopped them, citing ridiculous reasons. We questioned the security, hurting their egos. Now, they're not allowing anyone to visit our flat, including friends and colleagues. They're making up excuses to target us. Even the owner's intervention hasn't helped.\n\nHas anyone else faced similar issues? What legal recourse do we have against the housing society? Any advice would be appreciated.",

        "text": "I recently purchased a used car(skoda kushaq/paid 11 lakh)from Spinny, attracted by their promise of quality checks and “certified” vehicles. I thought I was making a safe choice, but within just 1000 km of driving(see screenshot from spinny website and the photo of my odometer), the car broke down completely. Considering the car is still under warranty, I expected some prompt assistance from Spinny, but my experience has been far from satisfactory.\n\nSpinny’s response to my breakdown was disappointing. The warranty coverage, as it turns out, barely helped with the actual expenses I’ve had to bear. I had to arrange my own roadside assistance (RSA), costing me thousands just to get the car towed. On top of that, I had to book a taxi to get back to my hometown as i was with my whole family and full of luggage’s , which set me back another 25,000 INR in additional expenses. And despite all this, Spinny has refused to cover any of these costs. I raised the RSA ticket the next moment it happened, i did not get any response from spinny for atleast 4-5 HRS.\n\nI feel totally misled by their promises of a “certified” car with full warranty support. Not only am I facing a major repair within days of purchasing the vehicle, but I’m also out an extra 25,000 INR due to Spinny’s lack of accountability.\n\nHas anyone else had similar experiences with Spinny? Would love to hear your thoughts.",

The whole pregnancy was something he manipulated her into—he kept calling her for “cooling-off talks” after they had separated, and during one of those times, he forced himself on her, which led to the pregnancy.  \n\nBefore this, she had already filed for divorce, but she withdrew it because he promised he’d take care of her and the baby. Now, months into the pregnancy, he’s completely abandoned her, leaving her to beg for money just to get by. Occasionally, he’ll send her ₹500 or ₹1000, but he makes a huge deal out of it every time.  \n\nHe’s still emotionally abusive, controlling, and threatening. His mere presence terrifies her and her mom, and he’s humiliated her in public repeatedly. She feels trapped—like the child is being used as a way to keep her under his control for life.  \n\nShe wants to know:  \n1. Can she file for a one-sided divorce and get out of this nightmare?  \n\n\n2. Can she keep the baby without him being able to interfere in their lives in the future?\n\n  \n3. Would giving the baby up for ADOPTION be an option, especially since she feels like the pregnancy is just another way he’s trying to enslave her?  \n\nShe’s a survivor of narcissistic abuse and is trying her best to stay strong, but she’s overwhelmed and doesn’t know what her legal rights are in this situation. Any advice or resources would be so appreciated.  \n\nThanks for reading and for any help you can offer.  \n\n",

I am willing to pay for further services but just wanted a well-rounded opinion to start with on this issue.\n\nThis is property-related and I will try to explain the issue below in a few bullet points.\n\n* We have a house in Southern Maharashtra which was bought and renovated by my uncle in 1981. He put the name of my father as well on all the documents out of goodwill (as per him).\n* We shifted to Mumbai in 2014 and never really went back since my father was not keeping well. He passed away in 2021 and the house was the least of my concerns. I had no background regarding who bought it for what, I was just told the legal situation was complex. I was busy with my life and did not really think much of the property since I had nothing to gain from it. I did not even transfer it to my name.\n* The house gradually got dilapidated. The neighbors complained that the structure is now dangerous and needs demolition. I called my uncle and we demolished it via some contractor.\n* Now he is saying he will issue me a notice that he lost valuable property due to my negligence. He spent a lot of time constructing this and should be compensated.\n* He had asked me to gift deed my share of the house to him so that he could construct a house there and there wouldn't be any legal issues further. I am more than happy to do it and have already started a process with a lawyer to clear a title.\n* **Now he has issued me a legal notice. He is accusing us of negligence and stating that due to our negligence, the house collapsed.**\n* **He is also accusing me of selling the debris and old stuff while demolishing the property.  He mentions that he got this information from some source. As a matter of fact, I paid the contractor to demolish it because I did not want to gain anything out of it and just wanted some peace of mind.**\n* **He is asking for a compensation of 50 lakhs.**\n* I am almost done with the name transfer and will be soon executing the relinquishment deed.\n* Over these many years, my uncle was aware of the house's condition but never once tried to contact us.\n* How worried I should be about this? My mother is very tense due to all this.\n\nPlease offer your valuable opinion. TIA!",

I won't get into the whole depth of his shitstorm throughout the 1+ year that we stayed together for our startup, but we decided to finally incorporate our company (Pvt. Ltd.) along with my other 3 friends at college.  \n  \nI realized the mistake I made by getting involved with him soon after the incorporation was done, and decided to resign from the company with no stakes and strings attached at all.  \n  \nI had left the flat in Delhi that we shared together about 2 months prior to him (he lives in Bihar and I live in Delhi), but right before leaving he owed 2 months' overdue electricity bill amounting to around 10k, rent of additional days stayed summing up to 1.4k, business expenses of approx. 5.5k from my end, and some household/rashan expenses from the time we were staying together.  \n  \nHe didn't appropriately inform me that he was leaving overnight except for a miss call which I failed to notice that day, didn't message me on WhatsApp or text, and only called me again around 12hrs after the miss call once he had left with all his belongings ALONG with the AC that we bought TOGETHER (50/50), and reached his friend's place (a very rich and unethical guy with an annual revenue over 50cr, who's also accused of duping my college junior's dad of 3L in the past during a business deal).\n\nMy ex-BP's dad knows me as well, but apparently he has been kept in the dark about all his wrongdoings. He wasn't aware of the money that his son owes me and was constantly lied to by him for extracting as much money for personal expenses (expensive clothes, daily food orders, gifts for girlfriend, vacations, etc.) as possible in the name of \"business\" while staying away from his family. His father seems skeptical of my claims even now, which I believe is purely because of the infinite lies he's been told by his own son. But even despite all my explanations and proofs, his father has never showed any voluntary interest in paying his son's dues, including the EMIs that he took for purchasing an iPhone through my credit card.\n\nRight before I gave my official resignation to the CA handling our company's filings I made a legal agreement with the ex-BP which mentioned that he needs to pay the pending EMI amount before the due dates every month, and the remaining lumpsum expenses by the end of this year i.e. today. We made this agreement in the district court where we also provided our fingerprints, but even despite the agreement he seems to be unbothered about it and hasn't yet paid this month's EMI (which was due yesterday and I had to pay by myself) and the remaining lumpsum amount as well. He has been giving excuses which revolve around \"I don't have the money right now, I'm on cash crunch\" Or \"My UPI isn't working, I'll try later\".\n\nI'm unable to avoid the stress I've been having from the lent amount and his + his father's lack of interest in returning it. I have to remind him every month for his dues at least twice or thrice, begging for my own money despite having lent to him as a friend and business partner, on top of the fact that I left a salary of 20LPA to work on our startup and ended up with getting cheated and a less than half of my previous salary in the current job after facing endless rejections/ghosting in all other companies.",

        "title": "Legal steps for a secondary secured business loan guarantor?",
        "text": "Hi all.\n\n\n\nSo my friend (primary guarantor) approached me in Nov 2022 to become a secondary guarantor for a secured business loan of 1.6 Cr (8 years tenure) for his father (borrower). Having worked with their business in 2019, I obliged to help since their business was working okayish and they were expanding. They also bought new machineries. Although that big amount scared me but my friend assured me that there is \"no need to worry\" and this is \"just for formality\". And they have a good relationship with their bank (co-operative bank) since many years. So I signed all the relevant documents in good faith and \"to help\". Yes, looking back, I was naive.\n\n\n\nAnd then I go about living my life and forget about it. They did not tell me whether the loan started and even I didn't inquire. They didn't give me any sanction letter as well. Note: I didn't have much salary in 2022 and 0 credit history (genuine question, why and how does a bank even approve such cases where guarantor is \"poor\", have no assets or personal wealth which can reimburse such a huge amount)\n\n\n\nUnaware, loan commences from Jan 2023. My friend and I don't talk since May 2023 due to some other personal issue. However there is no problem with his father.\n\n\n\nEverything is good until Jan 2024, I apply for a home loan and my bank tells me that I can't get a loan since I'm a guarantor in a business loan and it has irregular payments and a SUB (substandard) state.\n\n\n\nI call them and ask for a reason for the irregular payments. His father tells me the business is not working well and he is in talks with other nationalised banks for takeover (transfer loan to other bank) and for CC limit with current bank. I call his father back after a month. He says to call back in March since he is still in talks. I am furious at this point and since I don't have any control and feel that since he's been a businessman for soooo long and his relationship with bank is good, he will figure something out. I decide to wait more and give him time. I call back in May. Same response. I call him back in July, same response. He asks me to call back in Sep, I wait and decide to call him in Nov instead. He asks me to call back in Dec end. \n\n\n\nAt this point, full year's payments have been missed. I get a notice from bank in Dec beginning that loan has NPA'd in Aug 2024. I also get to know that there is another loan of 1.4 Cr signed by other guarantor. I also get a call from random bank asking me if I can contact my friend since he's missed the EMIs for his car (\\~40 lakhs) although I am not a guarantor in that (I checked the CIBIL reports myself).\n\n\n\nI decide to give his father a break and another benefit of doubt that he might be sorting this out. So I call him 2 months later, ie this month, Feb. He says he's still working on the takeover to nationalised bank.\n\n\n\nBut my patience is over. They are \"good\" people (I have seen them invest in good machineries for which they look loans and are expanding the business), but it seems to me that they have taken advantage of me and other to get loan approval (since a secondary guarantor could have been his wife as well or some other family member). I know they are more in agony than me which is why I decided to be calm about this, but like I said my patience is over now. A random google search also told me my friend, this time, has borrowed 9L for his own company and her mother as a guarantor and even that has NPA'd in Nov 2024.\n\n\n\nI know I am late but hopefully not too late asking for help. I know guarantor cannot be changed unless there is takeover. But I doubt nationalised bank is going to approve this because if it did, this would have been over already.\n\n\n\nSo what legal steps can I take to safeguard myself from bank screwing me over? ",

        "text": "I am seeking legal advice regarding a family dispute over the sale of a 1.5-acre piece of land that belonged to my late grandmother and grandfather. They had five daughters and one son. Unfortunately, both grandparents have passed away, and the land is now at the center of a disagreement among the heirs.\n\nThe issue began when the 4th daughter decided to sell the land and took an advance payment from a buyer without any formal written agreement. Initially, five of the siblings (including the son) agreed to sell the land and signed a non-official agreement on a plain paper. However, the 3rd daughter did not sign this agreement. Over time, the other two siblings became suspicious that the 4th daughter was making indirect profits from the deal and withdrew their support for the sale.\n\nAs a result, the buyer demanded compensation of approximately 3 lakhs from the 4th daughter, which she claims to have paid. She is now insisting that the rest of the family reimburse her for this amount. Additionally, she has allowed a farmer to cultivate the land, and the income generated from this arrangement has been used exclusively by her.\n\nI would appreciate your guidance on the following:\n1. What are the legal implications of the 4th daughter’s actions, given that there was no formal agreement?\n2. Are the other siblings legally obligated to reimburse her for the compensation she paid to the buyer?\n3. What steps can be taken to resolve this dispute fairly, especially regarding the cultivation income and the sale of the land?\n\nPlease let me know if you require any additional details to provide a more informed opinion.\n",

        "text": "Hello Folks,\n\nMe and my brother have been very close. Last year, He told me about a setup where I lend money to his friend who runs loan business. In return, he will give me interest at 1.5% and also registers one of the land plot on my name. I knew his friend personally since childhood but not close with him. I didn't think much. But I wanted to be safe. I asked the guy to write agreement on bond paper so that if he tries to screw me up, it will hold up legally. Agreement basically states that interested has to be paid monthly and money should be return upon the notice after one year of the lending. I actually work overseas. I trust my brother very much and asked him to be the power of attorney and get this plot registered on my name. I checked with several people. This is legal and can be done. Now, plot got registered on my name but power of attorney was his friend himself. This I came to know only after I received the registration documents. When I question, my brother shrugged it off and said some bullshit reason. Right after this, my brother got married and started a business without even telling me. I suspect there was some kind of arrangement between them to dupe me. I called his friend asked him that I need money and he said he will arrange by June this year. Btw, I lent him money May, 2024. He hasn't paid any interest amount at all. When I asked, he gave all kinds of excuses. I verified the documents in government portal, the plot is on my name. My brother's friend is into politics and kind of has some influence. My worry is that, he may not return the money and won't let me sell the land as well to recover money.\n\nAlso my brother grew distance with me and started telling lies about most of the things. Things haven't been well between us. For all these years, I thought he is the only one I thought I could trust. But it's apparent that I got betrayed by own brother. I once bailed him out of debt of 4 lakhs and took care of him when he got sick and hospitalised. It feels like stab in the heart.\n\nNow I seek your folk's advice on how to challenge this legally. Or is there any better approach to resolve this and recover money. Also my brother's friend being the power of attorney has any implication for my ownership of the plot?\n\nAny lawyer willing take up this? Happy to share the details over DM.",

I am currently building a home, and initially, my elder brother agreed to contribute to the EMI payments. However, we did not have a written agreement regarding this arrangement.\n\nNow, my elder brother is refusing to pay his part of the EMI for the home loan, although the loan is solely on my name. He is even demanding half of the home property in return.\n\nI would like to know what legal actions I can take to protect myself in this situation. Can I take any legal steps to ensure that I am not unfairly burdened with the entire EMI payment? \n\nAny advice or suggestions on how to handle this situation legally or possibly resolve it with the bank would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",

There, I connected with someone I'll call \"Manish\" (name changed), who has over a decade of experience in fintech. He seemed interested in my ideas and invited me to visit his office.\n\nI visited him recently, and after a long 5-hour discussion, he offered me the position of COO in his company with a promise of 10% equity if I achieved certain targets. As a recent graduate, I was excited and accepted the offer. He also shared some product details with me via a WhatsApp PDF and gave me a co-branded prepaid card, which I didn’t think much of at the time.\n\nAfter discussing this with my parents, they raised concerns, pointing out how unusual it was for someone with no work experience to receive such a significant offer. I started having doubts, and after some thought, I decided the role wasn’t for me. I also received a job offer from a Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical startup for an IT position, which is completely unrelated to fintech.\n\nWhen I informed Manish about my decision, he got angry and accused me of stealing his idea. He’s now demanding I:\n\n1. Sign an NDA retroactively.\n\n\n2. Personally return the co-branded prepaid card.\n\n\n3. Comply, or he’ll file a police complaint.\n\n\nI consulted a lawyer, who advised me not to sign any documents and suggested couriering the prepaid card instead of meeting him in person.\n\nTo clarify:\n\nI never signed an NDA or contract.\n\nI haven’t used or shared any information from the PDF he sent.\n\nMy new job is unrelated to fintech.\n\n\nI’m scared because Manish has political connections, and I don’t want this situation to escalate.\n\nWhat should I do? Should I follow my lawyer’s advice and courier the card, or is there anything else I should be doing to protect myself legally?\n\nAny advice or guidance would mean a lot.\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n",

However, my manager is now saying that if I take any leave during this period, my notice period will be extended accordingly.\n\nI checked my employment contract, but my HR said that not all policies are mentioned in writing—some are communicated verbally in favor of the company. However, there is no official documentation stating that taking leave extends my notice period.\n\nI even got an email from another HR representative confirming my last working day, and there was no mention of this rule. Still, my manager is being persistent, making it seem like an unwritten company practice.\n\nAt this point, I feel like they’re just trying to trap me into staying longer. I have a few questions:\n\n1. Can they legally force me to extend my notice period if it’s not in my contract?\n\n2. What’s the best way to push back without burning bridges?\n\n3. Has anyone else faced a similar situation? How did you handle it?",

        "text": "Hello, I am seeking legal advice regarding the recent tragic incident at KIIT University, where a Nepali female student reportedly passed away under suspicious circumstances. Reports suggest potential foul play, and there are allegations of institutional negligence and mishandling of the case by authorities.\n\nFrom what I understand, the university and local law enforcement have not been fully transparent about the situation. There are concerns regarding a lack of proper investigation, suppression of evidence, and possible pressure on the victim’s family and witnesses.\n\nAdditionally, reports indicate that when people protested against the handling of the case, Nepali students were told to leave the campus immediately, with many being evicted overnight. The eviction involved lathi charges, physical beatings, bruising, and other forms of excessive force. This action appears to be a violation of human rights and raises serious concerns about discrimination and arbitrary treatment of international students.\n\nWe also have recordings of the wardens speaking ill not only of Nepali people but also of Nepal as a country and our embassy. While we eventually received apologies, it was evident that these were primarily issued to protect KIIT’s reputation rather than as a genuine acknowledgment of wrongdoing.\n\nNow that the Embassy of Nepal has intervened, the university is calling all the students back, raising further questions about their motives and accountability in handling the situation.\n\nFor further context, here are some links to news articles and social media discussions about the case:\n\n* [https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/new-updates/kiit-student-suicide-police-arrest-21-year-old-boy-in-connection-with-nepali-students-death/articleshow/118344902.cms?from=mdr](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/new-updates/kiit-student-suicide-police-arrest-21-year-old-boy-in-connection-with-nepali-students-death/articleshow/118344902.cms?from=mdr)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bhubaneswar/comments/1is88l2/apology\\_video\\_by\\_manjusha\\_pandey\\_one\\_of\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bhubaneswar/comments/1is88l2/apology_video_by_manjusha_pandey_one_of_the/)\n\nGiven the gravity of the situation, I have a few legal questions:\n\n1. **What legal actions can be taken to ensure a proper and impartial investigation?** Would filing a writ petition in the High Court for a CBI or SIT inquiry be feasible?\n2. **Can university officials be held accountable for negligence or suppression of information?** If so, under what legal provisions?\n3. **What are the legal rights of students who want to protest or demand justice for the victim?** How can they do so while ensuring their safety and avoiding legal repercussions?\n4. **If evidence suggests homicide, what steps should be taken to push for a fair trial and prevent any political or institutional influence on the case?**\n5. **What recourse does the victim’s family have if they are facing coercion or pressure to settle or remain silent?**\n\nAny legal insights or recommendations on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, if there are any lawyers or legal organizations specializing in such cases, guidance on whom to approach would be helpful.\n\nThank you in advance for your advice.",

I was sick travelling to the other side of bangalore in peak traffic taking a day off from mynoffice during peak Q1 office requirements, I was let down by the management at the last moment, after 6pm until then , no communication blackout. \n\nThe audacity of the event managers to make influencer style videos outside the venue trying to normalize the cancellation of the concert was inhumane and dastardly.\n\nI was at the event. Talk about mismanagement before the show starts, not a single employee showed up to the box office. We were left clueless and hopeless, until somebody 'discovered' that CAS had released a post, saying the show is cancelled. I saw this post at 6pm when the show was supposed to start, standing in the VIP/lounge line luckily and it was less crowded, but i can't imagine the paranoia a typical goth guy/girl would face had they been left alone in those borderline dangerous circumstances. Especially the GA back queues, filled with a lot of people. I could see the fear in the minds of the solo concert goers there, the anxiety gripping their face as they faked a poker face. CAS has nothing to worry about, its the event managers that must be taught a lesson for the 'dangerous environment' they ended up creating. Lets make India a safe place, and before that, lets fix these people who dont value our time, our money, our jobs, our work. Lets regulate concerts in india.\n\nAny help from bangalore lawyers will be much appreciated.  Thanks folks, have a nice day.\n\n",

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI recently moved to the Dhanori area near Pune Airport in July, and I’m facing a significant issue with the noise from Indian Air Force (IAF) jets. Initially, there were only 2-3 take-offs a day, which were already quite loud, but now it’s escalated to 10-15 jets flying, taking off, and landing three times a day. This usually happens in the mornings around 8:30-9:00 AM (just as we’re waking up), again around lunch (12:00 PM), and late at night (10:00-10:30 PM) when we’re trying to sleep. The noise is so loud it’s unbearable, and it’s impacting daily life.\n\nI understand that military operations might be involved, but I’m curious if this is normal for residential areas near airports. My main concern is about our legal rights as residents.\n\n\t1.\tIs there a way to formally complain about this?\n\t2.\tAre there any noise regulations or protections for residents in such situations?\n\t3.\tWhom should I approach, and what steps can I take to address this?\n\t4.\tHas anyone else dealt with similar situations near military or civilian airports?\n\nI’m hoping to get some guidance on how to approach this from a legal standpoint, or at least some insight into whether this kind of noise disturbance is something we just have to live with.\n\nLooking forward to any advice or experiences you can share!\n\nThanks in advance!",
