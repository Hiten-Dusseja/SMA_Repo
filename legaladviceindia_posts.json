We went to the police station to lodge a complaint where we were made to sit for 2hours and no actions were taken against them, we were told to sign up a ‘compromise letter’. The police didn’t bother to check the cctv footage, they told us they will lock us up instead, on god knows what ground, when were the ones who were harassed?? What kind of justice has been served?\nThe police even told us they wouldn’t consider this matter, since it’s a small one, so what r they waiting for, for me to be harassed again by them?? Was pulling my t-shirt off me wasn’t enough?? do I need to get r$$$d to get justice??? I didn’t  even know them!!! I am new in the city is that my fault that I don’t have enough money to lodge a case or I don’t belong to a specific community??? Now they even have my address from the rough FIR sheet they made!!! M I safe?? We didn’t have any mark of physical assault on our body, they said, hence it’s not worthy for punishment? What about the mental trauma I went through??\n\nIs justice illegal in India??\n\n\n",

First through eJagriti. And when it did not processed due to technical problem (as said by commission). I visited physically with 3 copies to the court and +3 opposite party.\n\n> Background -- I am a student in engineering and has no idea of any legal thing.\n\n> My experiences --\n\n1. Learnt everything from basics on how to write index, proforma, memo, complaint, affidavit by own. No I don't have ant lawyer. Doing it on my own.\n\n2. I have collected every evidences and tried to put it all in the documents. Irrespective how small they are and how much weightage in the case. That increased the number of pages of the complaint. \n\nI had no idea court needs 3 copies of it and 3 to the opponent. That printing only costed me some ₹450 (it had color photographs as well).\n\n3. Once reached the commission to submit it physically. They asked me to tie all with a thread. AGAIN. I had no idea, took 30 min to do it. And once came back to office, they asked no, tie three separetly and other 3 separatly.\n\n4. Then they asked, where are the envelops? Only you need to buy and paste the postal stamps for the destination. (Now my files were already heavy)! It costed ₹145 per opponent party x3) for stamp duty. A4 envelop charges 6₹ each. (Indian post offices accepts only CASH!!!! No UPI)\n\n5. Once came back to commission office, they asked to open the threads and tie the envelops too with it. So I need to open and tie these too. \n\n6. Then they gone through the documents for corrections. I was in fear that what if there is correction now! Already given almost a day between this office and shops.\n\n7. Then the registrar signed it and I got the hearing date for next month.\n\n\n\nJust wanted to share it here. It was my first time so obvious I don't know the process and rules and regulations. \n\nBut also there is no plateform which can tell these things in advance. \n\nThe office people are also habitual of advocates filing the case so they were also first time telling someone, okay now go there, now sign here, now do this and that.\n\nMore importantly, I was in T-shirt and Jeans and it was mentioned at the entrance, no jeans tshirt are allowed!!!\n\nAnyways. Let's see. ",

        "text": "Hi all, so it is exactly as the title goes. We have a maid, 23/24F, who works at our house for almost 8-10 hours everyday.\n\nOne day we noticed a huge bruise on her face and upon enquiring she said she just fell. But my mother pressed on and she confessed that her husband beats her up. My parents were furious and called the guy up and told him to not hurt her and if he does it anymore we’ll complain.\n\nThings were fine for a few days but she appeared with a bruise and a cut on her lip again, when my parents said that they’ll straighten him out she asked them not to get involved as her husband says what will the police do, detain me for a couple of days, but after that I’ll be back for you.\n\nEveryone in the family is concerned as we all care about her as she’s a very jolly and good natured person and has become a part of the family in a very short time.\nFor more context she has a son who is around 8-10 years old and she’s from Nepal. She lives with her husband here and her kid is back in Nepal with her sisters and their kids studying.\n\nAny ideas on how to proceed in this case would really be helpful without the repercussions being that she faces any more abuse back at her place. I don’t think divorce is something she will consider. The husband works as a driver but is often kicked out of employment due to his drinking issues.\nThis is all happening in Mumbai.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceIndia/s/sY4BgqSoDu\n\nUpdate as per last post. \n\nCalled the police station, they said unless you have proof of it we can’t do anything. And the police enquirers about it with the men who were responsible but no actions taken apart from warning. \n\nNow new drama has started. And it’s escalating day by day and it’s spreading in the neighborhood. \n\nThe Lady, her daughter and the entire neighborhood is being verbally abused by this old man.\nThey have 2 house in the property. The entire property is owned by the lady. They have let him live in the old one. He has lots of property in his birth place and fertile land which he has asked someone else to look after. Apparently he was not kicked out of the main house, but he broke the lock of the old house and illegally moved in and police helped 🙂 (before Covid). He opened a bakery shop and it was doing well for sometime but then again he fought with everyone in the neighborhood and no one gives a F about him and no customers. So he closed the shop. His son tried to help him during Covid even though the father tortured him mentally and hit him to an extent where he broke a bone in his leg. The son is very depressed and he is a raging alcoholic because of his father and later he left to city for a job.  \nThe old man visits his girlfriends and sister’s house in the city and comes and goes whenever he wants, which is now completely stopped as they also kicked him out. \n\nHe is threatening to kill them all and burn the whole town. The words he uses are worst kind. \nFew days ago the Muslim lady gave them food and she opened the gate and came inside and he went outside the door where he lives and started abusing her for entering the property. \n\nHe started screaming “500rs for biryani - Friday special and pleasure everyone’, come to this lady’s house” . Entire neighborhood heard it.\nToday morning around 5:00AM he came and opened main gate wide open and entered the property and walked around the whole property and banged on the door, screamed and left. \nSince 12 pm he is non stop verbally abusing and going around knocking neighbors doors in hopes of making a scene but no is responding or opening the door for him. When he came to my house he almost pushed the door open and tried to barge in but my dad closed the door immediately and asked us to go inside. Seems like everybody in this town don’t want to be involved with this guy. \nThis is so unfair what the family is going through because of this man. \nInitial we all thought he didn’t deserve to be kicked out of the house, we thought the family used him and let him go. But once I sat with the daughter and heard the whole story, I understand now how domestic abuse is and how victims are made the bad guys. He has physically and mentally abused his wife, 3 days after they got married. His son was being beaten up when he got bored with wife. Surprised the daughter was never hit once. But he had emotionally tortured her. She got tired of seeing all this and left the house in hopes of a better life in 2014. Her brother stepped up and helped her with her education and stay. Now she is independent and takes care of her mom. \nNot once he tried to contact her or reach her out. He told the whole neighborhood and whoever he could find that she ran away from home with a guy and is a se* worker now. She came back to town almost a year ago. I have never seen any girl as strong, independent and conscious about things in life. She has a built life she wanted on her own and now She works for a reputed textile mill as a designer and she is earning pretty well and it itches him and every time he hears her talk to anyone on phone he yells saying her customer is calling. \nHe definitely doesn’t deserve a family like this. He has ruined everything he touches and keeps on hurting anything that makes him uncomfortable. \nIs it fair to let someone like this live comfortably in a society even if he is old (65-70) ? Why does the police always support the man if there’s no proof. Shouldn’t they be neutral and understand the situation first ? And the news is the old man has bribed more than ones.  \n\nI have asked the family to record as much as possible and have proof of all this and be strong and file an FIR. The relatives are brainwashing them to not file an FIR as it will bring bad name to the family. And neighbors are of no use. My own family says stay out of it, don’t get involved. \nThis boils my blood. \nI know I’m venting here, I wish I could do something. I have lost faith in the justice system. ",

        "text": "I purchased an Unacademy VIP subscription in morning of feb 21 paying ₹12,000 via UPI. I confirmed with salesperson that batch will work on my ipad and will be activated immediately after money is paid. After the payment, I received the invoice, but my batch was not activated. I placed countless calls to customer support, but there was no proper response. More than 24 hours later, on Feb 22(next day) evening, after multiple escalations, they finally activated my batch. \n\nOnce the batch was activated, I realized that the course was not working on my iPad(my primary device, Playback issues) When I contacted support again provided them with all the proofs, tried troubleshooting, nothing worked then they casually told me to use an Android device, which is completely unreasonable because I did not pay ₹12,000 to be forced to watch lectures on a phone.\n\nI posted about it on twitter tagging them. Later that evening, a support representative called me again. They cancelled my ICONIC subscription, which was bundled with VIP, and told me that I would be refunded. But after that no follow ups about refund, neither in return about it. Now, my ICONIC subscription is cancelled, but my VIP subscription remains active.\n\nAnother major issue is that the teachers in this batch had clearly stated that they would not be accepting students after Feb 15 because the coursework is too intensive, and it would be difficult for new students to catch up. I agree with this, yet the salesperson still sold me this batch on Feb 21, knowing I would struggle. Now, the teachers are saying that new students should just watch recorded lectures instead of attending live ones to have understanding of whats going on in class. The whole USP of this course was personal attention and live classes peer to peer. So after all this hassle, I am now being forced to pay ₹12,000 just for recorded content. The salesperson told me a complete different story. \n\nI have already filed a complaint with cybercrime and raised a grievance with Unacademy, to which they responded they will try to fix for ipad. (no dead line, no statement addressing the refund which was my main concern). I agree I have been naive here and shouldn’t have trusted sales people. I don’t know what my next step should be. What legal action can I take in this situation? I have my JEE Advanced in 80 days and all this is so mentally taxing. \n\n",

        "text": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI had purchased a home recently, which was in construction since 2021 in mumbai side. Last year we were in contact with A which was at camp which was setup by builders to facilitate interior design for customers. We got in contact with the designers with package for bedroom,kitchen and living room. Initially we thought it was good package which was around 3 lacs. So we went ahead gave initial token amount of 10k to designers but we were waiting for their inputs for long time we reached out to them again to know the status after which they asked to visit their main center to check out their interior and what package will include and overall details of the project. So based on the discussion we had discussed initial draft which had few things modified in their standard design. They started asking for money to start work of initial design which was 25k and as soon we would get the possession we would handover the flat for measurement. But builders had delayed the possession by 3-4 months which they were stating. So no work and no design was finalized as there were no measurements done. One fine day we get call from person  \"L\" company person that the project has been transferred to them from \"A\" and now i have to confirm the next steps. This person was working with company \"A\" earlier but now transferred to new company \"L\" and started working there hence project is also shifted maybe due to resource reduction. Initially i was doubful of this whole process on how they would shift project entirely to new company without my consent. They had setup a call with me on teams during which i told them even if they want to continue project they should provide me the same package mentioned by company \"A\" with changes i requested earlier. They said they will look into it. But after some days they were not responding then i decided to ask them what is the status as we got the possession. They replied you share us the detail what was discussed with company \"A\" and BOQ which ideally they should have communicated with them internally instead of asking me. Then i told them my expectations then person from company \"L\" started saying they cannot provide what i expected as i have to take the whole package instead of few changes and didnt want taking complete package at the price they were saying. So i said i want refund as they were adamant to not provide the required services. So i got their customer care email id. I mailed them regarding refund as there was no work done and design was not finalized. They completely rejected my request saying this will be accounted as part of design invoice.Mind you we have never  measurements done so design was never finalized and also no work was done but yet they are not giving back my money. Adding to the reply they sent screenshot of mail they sent me on 22 Jan 2025 that they are going ahead with project as per the given cost and design and stated that i didn't replied so i didnt had any concern. And main thing is that they sent this mail to unknown email id which i was not using. I replied them that the email you sent to the id is not mine and hence there was no confirmation from my side to go ahead with this project yet they are now on mute and havent replied after all evidences are against them. Please let me know what to do now they have my 35k.\n\nThanks",

Give it another few years, and AI will likely automate the majority of what lawyers and even judges do.  \n\nWhy would anyone hire a lawyer for basic legal work when AI can draft airtight agreements in seconds? Why would a client pay insane legal fees when AI can provide case strategies at a fraction of the cost? \n\nSo, tell me what actual value will human lawyers provide in upcoming years? \n\n",

        "text": "\n25F I set a strong boundary that he should not go after my Bra, 31M he said “Okay”, but then he didn’t stop, after some mins, He unhooked it without my permission, I said No multiple times 10-15, I was clearly uncomfortable, he kept pressuring me until I gave in out of fear, for he didn’t stop, his words were, “Hey Hey Hey Please please Hey Hey Hey Consistently”…. and forced me to remove it under pressure by consistently ignoring my NO…, I gave in out of fear and I was scared and I just wanted to get through the night. When he hid my eyes and enjoyed himself, with his mouth on my breasts, I froze in Fear—I couldn’t move or react, Like a Dead Body I froze (trauma response) He didn’t care if I’m Okay, if I’m comfortable, absolutely Nothing, My eyes were hidden and he did it……. Then, I fawned (which is trauma response)—hugging and kissing him, trying to find comfort, safety, and trust in an unsafe situation. And again I froze when he kept his mouth on my breasts. I questioned him the next day that why he forced me, and he admitted that he forced me knowingly ( but he said it wasn’t preplanned and he did it on the moment, Anga yaara eruinthalum apditha agi erukum, his words were, any man would have done the same in that place, such a disgust comment ( what was I an Object ?, that’s how it felt ), He excused himself with his words “I did you wrong but I’m not a wrong man” “why did you allow me to your home”.\n\nEven If it wasn’t my home, it would’ve still happened to me in any other day, at any other place, at any other time. It doesn’t have to be my home at night. The least respectful thing, he could’ve done is value my NO, but to him, “his desire” felt more important than my consent and comfort. \n\nEven though he admitted to forcing me but then he shifted blame and avoided accountability and said, \"At least you should have stayed in control.\" ( I told him I feel unsafe and I wanted to be alone, rather than addressing my feelings of unsafety, this was his opportunity to say “Ennakum thaniya tha erukanum nu thonuthu”, He betrayed me in days shortly afterwards, like use and discard ). Days before this incident, at his home during day time, he tried to remove my top by force, I said NO, he tried to remove it again, I held it tight so he stopped, he said to me, It must’ve triggered ur past trauma, I won’t ever do like that again. I thought what a good man, I trusted him and respected him enough to allow him to my home, when he asked me if he can visit mine, but now as he got awareness that removing it on his own despite NO, is clear violation, he coerced me by consistently pressuring me into it….\n\nHis Friends made excuses for his actions and invalidated me saying, “Forcing is wrong but it’s not preplanned, it’s situational and another one said, he must’ve had different intentions.” \n\nHe admitted that he did not Love me and he made false promises of marriage recklessly. The fawning and freezing was trauma response. Fawning was my brain, trying its best to find comfort and safety in him, after freezing where I went absolutely Frozen, unable to move. ( Him repeatedly ignoring my NO caused me to relive flashbacks of my past SA from Childhood, I had Flashbacks of it, when he repeatedly ignored my NO that is how much he forced me). It hurts a lot the trauma, Couldn’t express in words, it’s been months, He is Ex Boyfriend.\n\nIs this legally considered as a crime, in India \nBut I feel like I’d probably be victim blamed. \nJust cause I trusted him to Allow him to my home, doesn’t mean I owed him Sex / Sexual Activity.\nwe both mutually agreed on our Limits, from the beginning of relationship. \n",

We are taking the help of a CA to set everything up and hopefully everything goes as planned.\n\nMy client is leaving my company on 28th of February, 2025 which means I technically won't have anything to do after 28th of Feb, 2025 in my current company but my HR is forcing me to serve a 2 month notice period. I'm telling her that I don't plan on getting trained on new clients only to train somebody else and that would be a horrendous proposition for you because you don't wanna pay me any money for training - you pay me money for actual work.\n\nTechnically my client leaves then I leave and that should be the end of the story but this notice period thing is another form of harassment from my shitty company to make sure that I don't get the chance to work directly with my client.\n\nHow to deal with this? Technically the purpose of notice period as far as my understanding goes is to - make sure you train a new person on your existing process and tasks etc. before you leave. But since my client is leaving the services of my current company, there is practically no need to train anyone on my process. Why tf is my company then harrassing me for this and forcing me to serve this BS notice period?\n\nI don't know if there is a provision to reduce or buyout notice period by giving them some portion of your salary back but for me this is pure and utter harassment.\n\nOn top of that, these people are telling me that they want in written that I wouldn't be working with my client directly.

I updated my LinkedIn (and this was a dumb move). I didn't think they would care because they were going to terminate the contract with the client. And as of June 2024, the company I'm working with is no longer their client. \n\nThe company sent a legal notice(I replied to it through a lawyer) in May and then I got a summons on 3rd Feb 2025 that the case will be ex-parte if I don't show up. I checked the details and the case was registered in July last year but I never got any notice. Only got the summons recently. \n\nNow, I'm talking to a lawyer and he assured me that it won't stand. But I'm worried about having to spent a lot of money on travelling since the company is in Pune which is almost 1600KMs. Lawyer also said it'll take atleast 7-8 hearings. So, I'll have to spend a lot of money on flights plus lawyer's fee. \n\nThey have accused me of other things as well in the legal notice. \n\nHere is the non-compete clause - \n\nI will not for period of two year afer the termination of this agreement,\nwhether voluntarily or involuntarily\n\n• directly or indirectly solicit to provide, without the prior written consent of the Company, any professional services such as those provided by the Company for anyone who is a client of the Company anytime during the twelve months prior to my leaving the Firm and for whom provided any services as an employee of the\nCompany during the five years prior to my leaving or (b) directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Company, solicit for employment with myself or any Company or entity with which I am associated, any employee of the Company or otherwise disrupt, impair, damage, or interfere with the Company's relationship with its employees. \n\nWhat should I do?

My entire family was happy, thinking I would receive the benefit.\n4️⃣ Later, we saw news reports that the scheme funds were disbursed, but I did not receive the money.\n5️⃣ We went to the District Education Office (DEO) to check, and they said my school is not on the list, meaning I am not eligible, because govt said that schools which come under the department of school and run by this department will be eligible, and my school is municipal school.\n6️⃣ When we questioned this, the officer called my school principal and told them to take back my certificate, saying my school is under Nagar Nigam (Municipal Corporation) and not eligible.\n\nMy Questions:\n\n🔹 Can they cancel my eligibility after officially approving and certifying me?\n🔹 If my school was not eligible, then why did my principal gave written certificate and with seal, sign.\n🔹 Is there any legal way to challenge this decision?\n🔹 Can I file a case for \"Breach of Legitimate Expectation\" since I was officially awarded and later denied the benefit?\n🔹 What should be my next steps?\n\n\nThis feels unfair and unjustified, as the mistake was made by officials, not me.

        "text": "I Recently checked my CIBIL score and found that my score has been negatively impacted due to a credit card from Kotak MAhindra Bank that I never applied foror have used. I only opened a Kotak 811 online account a long time ago, around March 2023, but I never completed KYC or applied for any credit card nor i have any other accounts in this bank. Despite this, my CIBIL report is showing a delayed payment on a Kotak credit card, which i had no knowledge of.\n\nAdditionally, my CIBIL report is didplaying another persons name, email, mobile number, and addresses, which are completely unretaled to me. I do not know this person, and I have completely no Idea why their details are linked to my credit report. I think this is a serious identity mix-up or ossible fraud.\n\nI contacted Kotak Mahindra Bank via email regarding this issue ( attached my CIBIL report highlighting the false information and a copy of my Aadhar and PAN ), asking them to rectify this issue, but their response was that I need to file an FIR and send them a copy before they take any action.\n\nI am unsure about the legal process here. Do I really need to file an FIR, or is there any other legal route i can take? Also, what steps should i take to fix my CIBIL report that this does not affect my financial credibility in the future?\n\nAny Guidance on this would be very helpful to me.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nScreenshots of Emails are here\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/B9J23dG.png](https://i.imgur.com/B9J23dG.png)",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m writing this post on behalf of my friend **B.**, a student at NIFT Bhopal, who’s currently dealing with a horrible situation. I’ve watched her go through so much emotional distress lately, and I feel it’s important to bring this to light. It’s not just a personal struggle—it’s a bigger issue that we, as a community, should not tolerate.\n\n**Here’s the story:**\n\nA student from MNNIT Allahabad **KS** a 1st-year [M.Tech](http://M.Tech) student in the Electrical Department, has been relentlessly harassing my friend, **B.**, for weeks now. It started with phone calls that she tried to ignore. When she blocked his number, he didn’t stop. Instead, he began reaching out to other female students at NIFT, including the hostel warden, to continue his harassment.\n\nThis has caused my friend a lot of emotional distress. She feels unsafe, and understandably so. The constant anxiety and fear have taken a toll on her mental well-being.\n\nNow, I’m writing this not just to share what’s happening, but also to raise awareness and seek help for my friend. **B.** has reported this incident to the NIFT Anti-Ragging Committee, but what’s concerning is that the harasser is from MNNIT, which is 700 km away from us. This has made things more complicated, and my friend is worried that the situation won’t be taken seriously enough because of the distance between the institutions.\n\nSo, **what can we do about it?**\n\n1. **Speak up and raise awareness:** Harassment in any form is not something we should tolerate, whether it’s online, via phone calls, or in person. It’s important for all of us to talk about these issues openly so that victims don’t feel alone.\n2. **Support the victim:** **B.** has been brave enough to come forward, but she needs support. Whether it’s a simple message of encouragement, sharing similar stories, or offering advice, we can help make her feel less isolated.\n3. **Stand up together:** This incident is not just an isolated case. Harassment happens far too often in educational institutions, and it’s crucial that we all stand together to say \"enough is enough.\" If you’ve gone through something similar or have any advice on how to approach this, don’t hesitate to reach out.\n4. **Seek legal help:** We also know that this situation might require further legal action, especially with the involvement of multiple institutions. If anyone has experience with similar cases or knows of any resources we can tap into, it would be really helpful.\n\nI’m sharing this post because **B.** needs support, and I believe it’s time for us to start speaking out and supporting each other when we face harassment or any form of violence. No one should feel unsafe because of another person’s actions, especially in a university environment where we should feel secure and respected.\n\nPlease, if you’ve gone through something like this, or if you know how to escalate this situation effectively, please let us know. We need all the help we can get to make sure **B.** gets justice and to stop this behavior from continuing.\n\nThanks for reading, and let’s make sure **B.** knows she’s not alone.",

Well, may be for a few certainly, when we all have got bills to pay.\n\nNonetheless, here's a hack for such matters: Wait for a couple of hearings to be exhausted without submissions. Thereafter, find genuine grounds of urgency related to the circumstances, and move an early hearing application. These grounds may be anything, such as, in bail matters, long incarceration, or, completion of evidence of private witnesses; in commercial matters, blocked inventory's value being diminished/perished, or, irrepairable loss due to further non-intervention by Court etc. \n\nIt's rare that the concerned Court takes action or allows the early hearing application on the same day and proceeds with hearing, in fact, it is a matter of procedure that first, a notice is issued to the other party. However, this is where you get to bargain for interim reliefs. A liberal judge will certainly acknowledge genuine prayers. It may not be a 10/10 hack, but, AS AN ADVOCATE, I will any day choose the odds of 6/10 and get early hearing than waiting indefinitely.

        "text": "I was a working person living alone in the city of New Delhi. I was employed in an organization X in December. While I was referred by someone from one of the colleagues in X, the company requested me to join immediately. Since, I was working in a reputed institution already, I had to request them to relieve me early since I wanted to join this company X. The hiring team in X hired in a hurried manner and then after 2.5 months tells me that I have been discontinued. \n\nThe HR of the company informs me this, but not over an email or official letter. They informed me over a text message on MS Teams. Now, as shocked as I was, I wanted to check if a company can terminate my employment all of a sudden. After checking the appointment letter, I observed the points under separation section (points attached at the end of the post).  Upon asking the HR about the reason, I was told that since the project is coming to an end, they are discontinuing with people and my team management offered them names, including mine, to terminate our employment.\n\nNow, while I was employed on full time basis and not contractual, they terminated me as such. While I am looking for jobs, I am uncertain on my sustenance in the city without proper financial aid. Thus, I have a few questions and points looking for advice:\n\n1. Can the company terminate me just like that, giving me 15 days notice period, and informing me over a text message on MS Teams?\n\n2. When I had written an email to the entire management team including HR requesting for a written formal letter of termination along with the reason for such, I did not receive any reply to my mail. Instead, the HR again texted me over Teams saying that I was already told about the reason of my termination over Teams and why am I making a request over an email.\n\nThe separation clause had only the following points (writing the points since I can't attach images):\n\n\"*Given that this is employment at will, both sides would be free to end the engagement by giving a written notification.*\n\n*2. To ensure a smooth separation process being a confirmed employee both the parties has to give clear 30 days advance intimation. This notice duration cannot be compensated in any other form.*\n\n*3. No verbal or written communication from any authority other than undersigned or CEO can overrule this term at a later date*.\"\n\n3. Does my situation stand a chance as a case? If so, \n\n4. Can I receive any legal advice on my case?\n\nAny help or advice in this situation would greatly help me considering I support my family and I live alone here.",

Based on this, I flew from Thailand solely for this purpose, paying for flights and accommodation.\n\nWhen I arrived, the lehengas weren’t ready. The brand then promised free international shipping to Thailand with all customs fees covered. I have this in writing and have proof of them committing to this. When they shipped, they falsely declared the lehengas as “gifts” with undervalued invoices without informing me. This led to customs seizure in Thailand, and I had to pay INR 1,09,320 to release them. Now, they refuse to reimburse the full amount.\n\nGiven the financial loss (flights, hotels, mental distress), should I take this to Indian Consumer Court?  ",

He said that while that is true, that doesn’t mean that I can take a U turn unless the signal explicitly says that I can take a U turn.

My first wife passed away many years ago when two of our daughters very very young. \n\nFew years ago I started dating another women and very early into the relationship she gets pregnant with our child. Initially as I had known her not for that long, so I refused to marry her. She anyway said that she wants to go ahead with this child and would like to bring this child up in a family. So we started living together.\n\nAt the time of delivery hospital staff, doctors repeatedly asked for the father of the child and with so much of explaining, and prioritising her mental health, and giving a child a legitimate name, I gave in to have some marriage registered.\n\nShe got hold of her three friends as witness and some priest from her temple to sign the forms and we registered the marriage with local municipality giving some arbitrary date as marriage date. No actually marriage under Hindu customs ever took place.\n\nSo say our daughter was born on 10th, our registration happened on 25th (after she was born), so as we don't face any hassle in giving her legal status.\n\nHowever it turned out that we were just not right for each other. Now few years down the line we have decided to live separately and given how things are this will mainly lead to a divorce.\n\nFor context, we both are working professionals and earn decent livings to provide for our kids and live a good life in a metro. I have more assets than her. \n\nAs long as it is mutual I am all for it, however if she suddenly starts asking for Alimony, by Hindu marriage act she can claim 1/3 of my assets. My lawyer has advised that this may get reduced as I am sole provider to my 2 daughters from my previous marriage, plus looking after my aging parents, so Alimony amount would get reduced substantially if I am able to show genuine liablities.\n\nMy question here is can alimony be nullified if I say we actually never got married under Hindu act, and registered marriage was only done to give me third daughter a legitimate name. Also if you see all witnesses and priest who signed the document were all from her side, which shows this was done under some duress that time.  \nI am ready to take 100% care of all my daughters.\n\nPlease advice.\n\n",

Collection of Penalties in Personal Accounts\n\nThe collected penalty amounts are being transferred into personal bank accounts of students managing these committees, rather than an official college account.\n\nThere is no formal documentation, invoice, or receipt provided for such transactions.\n\n3. Awareness of Faculty\n\nThe Faculty Chair of Student Affairs is aware of these practices but has not intervened to regulate or stop them.\n\nThis raises concerns regarding administrative oversight and possible complicity.\n\n4. Coercion and Threats\n\nStudents who refuse or delay payment are subjected to additional penalties.\n\nThere have been explicit threats that non-payment will result in exclusion from the placement process, which severely impacts students' career prospects.\n\nGiven these threats, I would like to understand whether this situation falls under Section 384 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which deals with extortion. If students are being coerced into making payments under the fear of professional repercussions, does this qualify as a criminal offense under IPC?\n\nGiven the severity of this issue, I would appreciate your legal guidance on the following points:\n\n1) Are such penalties legally enforceable by a student-run committee?\n\n2) What legal recourse do affected students have against such financial and professional coercion?\n\n3) What steps can be taken to report and escalate this matter within legal frameworks?\n\n4) Does this situation amount to financial misconduct or extortion under applicable laws, particularly IPC Section 384?\n",

After that there had been several incidents which involved my dad beating up my own mother which had ended up badly such which like end up in breaking my mom's hand and back she's still in ayurveda treatment. Our family had been suffering from abuse from my own dad. Once I had supported my brother which the mistake on my dad’s side, my dad slapped my brother for the mistake which my dad did. In the evening my dad brought up the scene again saying lots of shit about my brother I couldn't handle the pain and got up and supported my brother. I said my brother didn't have a single mistake and it's better if I suggest dad to go for some treatment because treating his own children like slaves or prisoners ain't a good thing. My dad didn't like the approach I did my mom came to protect me my mom got a slap and I got angry and grabbed my dad threw him to the bed which ended up a bumb at his head but he got up fast and grabbed a knife which he almost came up to stab me but he dropped it after my mom screamed at him and he exchanged it for a belt and whacked me with and kicked me out of the house at 1 AM and I didn't regret the decision for supporting my brother. I left that house at that night and my brother came in the house after his work and got to know everything and he came running after me and hugged me crying that never ever someone supported me like this bearing beatings for me. I said like I couldn't handle he had to bear lots of things so I did my role as a brother. We walked for sometime and got inside the home at early morning 6 AM. By that time dad had gone for work, there had been a situation where it was a limit when I almost called 911 but he threatened me that if I get arrested now the day he gets out the jail he will hunt down us and brutally murder us and dispose the body.  The society  won't support us as they are big fan of him so they will think we are escaping because  are jealous of his successfullness. What should we do guys? Help us to solve this issue\n",

I, nonetheless, kept making my payments on time and eventually ended up paying for the full treatment even before the treatment was over. Shortly after that, my orthodontist began ignoring me. She has no assistant and the clinic where she practises has no staff. I have to call her personally to make appointments with her. During the first few months, getting an appointment with her was very easy as her practice is very new and she has few patients (I only ever saw two patients in her clinic). \n\nBut since the past few months, getting an appointment has become a hassle. She refuses to take my calls. She doesn't respond to my texts. She keeps deferring the appointments even though I have been paying her a nominal fee for each appointment even after I already made the full payment. \n\nIn the past week, things have come to a head. My extraction gaps are opening up and some of my teeth have begun to rotate. I have called her several times to get an appointment. But she refuses to set up the appointment. I don't know what to do. It is not possible for me to switch to a different orthodontist as I have already spent a considerable amount for the treatment.\n\nIs there any legal action I can take against my orthodontist if not for physical harm, then for the considerable mental harrasment I have been subjected to since becoming her patient?\n\nPlease help!",

        "text": "\n\nIt has been 120 days since I was suspended. 120 days of 95% radio silence. No clarity, no communication—just a career put on indefinite hold because a major Indian airline decided to punish me for replying to a colleague’s WhatsApp message.\n\nI have not leaked confidential information. I have not insulted the company. I have not done anything that puts their name in jeopardy. But I have been banned from the airport, not allowed to return to my hometown, and left in professional limbo—all because I dared to have a conversation.\n\nHow It Started:\n\nThe real issue? I raised concerns about the company’s room-sharing policy.\n\nFor those who don’t know, the airline forces cabin crew to share hotel rooms during layovers. It doesn’t take a genius to see why this is a terrible idea. There have been cases of theft, harassment, and even smuggling linked to this practice. Every crew member knows the risks, but the management refuses to acknowledge them.\n\nI used official channels to report my concerns. No response. I tried again. Still nothing. The system is designed to ignore complaints so that the airline never has to take responsibility.\n\nSo, when I discussed the issue in a private WhatsApp group with colleagues, I wasn’t doing anything radical—I was just looking for support from people who understood. And that’s when they decided to come after me.\n\nThe “Charges” Against Me:\n\n\t1.\tNot maintaining “high standards” of work ethic and conduct.\n\t•\tBecause questioning an unsafe policy is apparently unprofessional.\n\t2.\tNot adhering to company policies and SOPs.\n\t•\tEven though nothing I did violated any actual policy.\n\t3.\tCommitting acts “prejudicial” to the company’s interests.\n\t•\tIf pointing out safety risks is against the company’s interests, what does that say about them?\n\t4.\tInsubordination, inciting disruption, breaching law.\n\t•\tTheir biggest lie—that I organized a “mass sick leave” protest. Reality? I actively discouraged it. But they twisted my words, removed the context, and turned it into an excuse to get rid of me.\n\nThe “Inquiry”—If You Can Even Call It That:\n\n\t•\tCross-examination? Denied. Because why allow fairness when you can just declare someone guilty?\n\t•\tEvidence? Out of context, manipulated, misinterpreted.\n\t•\tKey questions? Ignored. Because the answers wouldn’t fit their narrative.\n\t•\tUnderstanding how WhatsApp works? Nonexistent. The inquiry officer thought a pinned message was a “heading” and used it as proof of my intent. This is the level of “expertise” deciding my career.\n\t•\tCode of Conduct? Only enforced when it suits them. The same principles they preach about fairness, transparency, and protection from retaliation? Completely ignored when it’s inconvenient for them.\n\nThe Reality:\n\nI have not leaked anything. I have not defamed the company. I have not done anything illegal. Yet I’ve been treated like a criminal—stuck in a city I don’t belong to, unable to return home, banned from my workplace, and left in a void of silence.\n\n120 days. No proper explanation. No fair trial. No closure. Just silence.\n\nThis isn’t about policy violations. This isn’t about misconduct. This is about a company using its power to silence employees who dare to question its flawed systems.\n\nThey are dragging this out, knowing the financial and mental toll it takes. They are waiting for me to break, to give up, to disappear quietly. But I refuse.\n\nIf this is how they treat someone who simply spoke up about safety, imagine what else they’re hiding.",

        "title": "My Father’s Infidelity Has Destroyed My Family – What Can We Do?",
        "text": "I (18F) just can’t take it anymore. My parents are married for 23 years now. My mom, my siblings (mom 50F, sister 19F, brother 12M), and I have been living in hell for years.  It's all because of my father. Firstly he had no job for about 14 years after marriage, we were surviving on the rent we receive. We were always deprived of basic things yet father and grandparents boast about their money and them keeping us. But no one ever imagined my father would get into cheating. He will get into extra martial affair(s). The worst part? His family defends him, threatens us, and acts like we are the problem.\n\nIt started in 2017 when I was 11. I caught my dad chatting with a woman—our family friend’s mom—her calling him “Jaan.” I was too young to process it, but I knew something was wrong. My sister and I started keeping track, catching their flirty messages and late-night calls. We kept this secret long enough but two years later, we confronted the woman’s kids (who were our friends), and guess what? They already knew. Even her own son saw my dad sneaking into their house when no one was home.\n\nWe all planned to expose them. My mom didn’t believe us at first, but we gathered proof. When we finally confronted our dad and the woman in 2019, they denied everything. My dad fake-admitted guilt just to end the conversation, and life went on like nothing happened. But the affair didn’t stop. He kept choosing that woman over my mom, over us. He’s humiliated my mom in public, defended that woman over his own family, and even slapped me for speaking against them. He prioritized their kids over us.\n\nLockdown made things worse. The fights at home increased. That woman’s husband eventually found out in 2021 and moved his family away, but my dad still didn’t stop. By 2022, my mom had enough. He started confronting him and begging him to stop and not ruin the two families but he least cared. Then, last year, she caught him hugging our housemaid. That broke her completely. When she finally told my grandparents about it the next day of witnessing in July 2024, they blamed her. They protected their son, accused us of lying, and turned against my mom. They even stopped the maid from leaving.\n\nA big blow came when my mom confronted that woman’s husband. My father lost it. He came home unexpectedly right after 1 hour of my mom's talk with that woman's husband, packed his bags and left, blaming my mom for ruining his life. My grandparents threatened to throw us out and even warned my mom she could go to jail if anything happened to their “innocent” son. They never tried to make that man(father) realise his faulty behaviors but rather blamed my mom. Their, that woman's husband called her mom, beat her up, asked for a divorce. Meanwhile, my dad was out there drunk-dialing that woman’s kids, demanding to take their mom away with him\n\nMy mother thought that maybe this will end now but man never. This happened again, my mom caught my father again with that maid a few days back, this time she shouted at that instant itself. Grandparents defended their son again. \n\nMy mom wants a divorce, but she’s scared. She has no money, no property, no family to support her. My grandparents say we won’t get a single penny. And if we want to live, we(the children) can but my mother will be thrown away. My father is still involved with multiple women not just her but she is the main culprit, but no one sees him as the problem—only us.\n\nI can’t focus on my entrance exam anymore, my sister is juggling part-time work, and my brother is too young to understand the full extent of this. My mom is mentally exhausted, surviving only for us. We’re stuck, with no way out, and I don’t know what to do anymore. Anytime soon, anything can happen. I am not scared of consequences but the fact that I am in exam prep. I want revenge. I want to show them what they’ve done. We can’t keep living in this hell. It’s enough.\n\nHow do we fight this? How do we escape this hell? Please, any advice or help would mean everything right now.\n\n\n\nlong story short> My father is in extra marital affair with multiple woman but one to be main. His parents and him blame us for everything happening, threatens us that even if we file a divorce we will be left with nothing. They daily fight, shout, scream. We can't live in this hell anymore, any genuine advice would mean a lot.\n\n",

This will be in the form of FDs and MFs where I am the second party and property. My wife does not know the exact amount I will receive, but she knows I will get a good amount.\n\nQ1. Is she entitled to receive a share of my inheritance? If she is, then no questions asked, I will happily share her rights with her (However, I am clear that I do not want anything from her inheritance whenever she gets it).\n\nQ2. If she is not entitled to receive a share of my inheritance, it is likely that she will again start quarrels and harass me to get something. I wouldn't be surprised if she even puts cases of divorce against me to get alimony etc. What should I do that is ethical yet legally smart? Should I just give her a part of it to maintain peace? Should I form a trust and transfer the money (which is currently in the form of FDs and MFs) to that trust? Or is there anything else I can or should do to prevent losing the inheritance unnecessarily?",

        "text": "I live in a housing society in Hyderabad, and I'm seeking legal advice on how to deal with the harassment we're facing from the maintenance staff.\n\nWhen we first moved in, we dealt with two ladies from the maintenance staff. They showed us flats and quoted high prices, demanding brokerage fees. We found a better deal through another broker and paid them instead. This upset the maintenance staff, who felt they'd lost out on the brokerage. Throughout the year, they made life difficult for us.\n\nRecently, our lease ended, and three of my flatmates left. My friend and I wanted to stay, so we asked the owner if we could find new flatmates. She agreed, but the maintenance staff intervened, claiming \"replacements are not allowed\" and that \"co-living\" is not permitted. Their reason is that one of the original flatmates was my friend's sister, and now that she's left, they're citing this as an issue.\n\nHowever, our parents have no problem with our living arrangement, and the owner is also okay with it. In fact, our parents have visited us multiple times without any issues. It's clear that the maintenance staff is selectively targeting us, as there are other bachelors co-living in the society who came through them.\n\nWhen potential new flatmates came to visit, security stopped them, citing ridiculous reasons. We questioned the security, hurting their egos. Now, they're not allowing anyone to visit our flat, including friends and colleagues. They're making up excuses to target us. Even the owner's intervention hasn't helped.\n\nHas anyone else faced similar issues? What legal recourse do we have against the housing society? Any advice would be appreciated.",

The impact was strong, but thankfully, we were wearing seat belts, so we weren’t injured. The sound of the crash made everyone look in this direction. The other car hit us forcefully, and we noticed the driver was on his phone at the time.\n\nWe have recordings from the scene showing the damage. Our car sustained only minor damage, with some scratches and a damaged light. The other driver gave us his phone number and mentioned he owns a workshop where he could repair the damage or he agreed to cover the damages and share the bill with him. Since I had a flight to catch, we agreed to this arrangement.\n\nHowever, after the accident, when we tried to contact him, he claimed he was on the way somewhere and promised to send the workshop details via WhatsApp. After that, he stopped responding entirely. Using his number, we managed to find his workshop location and Instagram account and page for business. We kept trying to reach him, but whenever he picked up, he stayed silent. We ended up fixing the light issue at a nearby workshop for just ₹1500, leaving only a small dent and some scratches on the car.\n\nNow, we're unsure what steps to take next. I also have videos of him speaking on the phone even after the accident.",

We were promised a completion deadline of July 2026, but it's clear that this deadline is unattainable as the developers have yet to obtain the necessary Occupancy Certificate (OC) from the government.\nTo date, we've invested ₹50 lakh in this project. Despite this significant financial commitment, we've received no concrete assurances or timelines for the project's completion. Instead, we're met with continuous delays and unfulfilled promises.\n\nThis morning, the developers spoke to a my family member and mentioned an outstanding payment, implying that we would be charged extra for not making the payment. We've consistently communicated our readiness to make the payment, provided they produce the correct legal documents required for construction from the BMC. They mentioned that they will deduct 20% of what we have payed if we plan to back off. \n\nFurthermore, after expressing our intention to withdraw from the project due to these delays, another consultant responded with yet another unsubstantiated promise that the project would commence in January 2024. We are now in February 2025, and the project remains stalled with no substantial progress or credible explanations.\n\nThe lack of responsiveness and accountability on their part is unacceptable. We've had to make numerous follow-up calls, often without any response, only to be met with false assurances.\n\nHas anyone else experienced similar issues with property investments? What steps did you take to resolve them? Any advice on how to proceed legally would be greatly appreciated. Also we are looking for people who have invested in Ruparel.",

She is very disciplined and does well in her studies.\n\nInitially, she used to complain that her teacher would get angry for no reason and yell at every child in the class. One day, when I went to pick her up, I saw her teacher yelling at one of the kids. I immediately reported this to the school. That same day, I received a call from the coordinator. I told her that I would not send my daughter to school until her class was changed or the teacher was removed. She asked me to come to the school to meet her in person.\n\nWhen I went to the school, she assured me that she would address the issue but also blamed it on the fact that my daughter was still adjusting to the Indian system. She also mentioned that the teacher had been with the school for many years.\n\nFor the next few weeks, everything seemed fine, but then we started noticing behavioral changes in our daughter. She began saying sorry even when she hadn’t done anything wrong. She got scared if her nails weren’t trimmed. She became excessively anxious about completing her homework. When she fell sick, she worried that missing school would make her teacher angry.\n\nWhen my wife tried to discuss these concerns with the teacher, she dismissed them, saying that we were worrying too much and that schools in India function differently from those in the US.\n\nI feel I should do something about this school. I think others simply take their kids to different schools. But ideally this school should be penalised for harassing students. \n\nAny advice?",

They showed us flats and quoted high prices, demanding brokerage fees. We found a better deal through another broker and paid them instead. This upset the maintenance staff, who felt they'd lost out on the brokerage. Throughout the year, they made life difficult for us.\n\nRecently, our lease ended, and three of my flatmates left. My friend and I wanted to stay, so we asked the owner if we could find new flatmates. She agreed, but the maintenance staff intervened, claiming \"replacements are not allowed\" and that \"co-living\" is not permitted. Their reason is that one of the original flatmates was my friend's sister, and now that she's left, they're citing this as an issue.\n\nHowever, our parents have no problem with our living arrangement, and the owner is also okay with it. In fact, our parents have visited us multiple times without any issues. It's clear that the maintenance staff is selectively targeting us, as there are other bachelors co-living in the society who came through them.\n\nWhen potential new flatmates came to visit, security stopped them, citing ridiculous reasons. We questioned the security, hurting their egos. Now, they're not allowing anyone to visit our flat, including friends and colleagues. They're making up excuses to target us. Even the owner's intervention hasn't helped.\n\nHas anyone else faced similar issues? What legal recourse do we have against the housing society? Any advice would be appreciated.",

For context, my father had an extramarital affair, almost six years ago with a girl, who was a minor back then. Now, onto the issue. In 2019, my uncle, my paternal grandmother, and my father ‘gifted’ 14.2 acres of property, including our house to my mother, which means that my mother owns that much land. My father sold his share of the property and ran away five years ago, and to this date, refuses to divorce my mother. In 2022, my mother sent my brother to the UK for his bachelor's degree, as he was in his freshman year. In 2023, I also went to the UK to do my final years of schooling there, for which she sold some part of the property. However, my brother was sent back by his university because my father did not pay the fee, despite having the money kept with the remittance company sent by my mother. And, the same thing happened to me in 2024, where my mother had to sell her jewellery to pay my school fee, despite having the money with the remittance company, but my father took that money as well. Due to some legal issue, my father cannot leave the country, so, he was talking to the finance team, as well as the principal of my school. Now, we don't know what conversation they had, but, the principal wasn't convinced of taking me back to school, probably because my father might have misbehaved with the school management. So, my brother’s 2 years' worth of studies, and my high school studies have been destroyed completely because of him. Skip to today, as I am crying while typing this, my father sold everything which was given by my uncle and my grandmother, including the house where I spent my entire life. My father took money under my mother’s name, which we never received, nor did my mother allow my father to sell anything from her share of land. He also stole every single document related to the property, including my secondary school mark sheet. My mother lived with me in the UK till February, which, she went home in March (for 1 week) and in September (for just one day) to renew her visa (she was on a tourist visa), because my father did not allow her to stay back home for long. Now, my mother is suing my father for every penny he got for the land he sold under the disguise of my mother’s name, because he, and a lady who acted as my mother, took a lot of money, and we don't know what to do. I honestly don't know what to do with all of this going on. It feels like everything has vanished, destroyed to the ruins. I honestly wanted to get this off my chest, and also wanted to get some advice from Reddit. If anyone has any kind of legal advice or any advice in general, we would appreciate it very much.",

We met her only twice—once when my parents met her and her family, and the second time when my brother and I were present as well. However, my brother didn’t like her and decided to reject the proposal.  \n\nThere was almost a month-long gap between these two meetings due to unforeseen events. During this time, my brother and the girl spoke on the phone maybe twice and exchanged only a few text messages. He was never interested in the proposal, but since my parents liked her, they wanted him to meet her once, which he did.  \n\nThe girl’s family was informed about a week ago that we would not be proceeding with the proposal. As soon as they received the news, the girl and her father started calling us repeatedly. The girl wanted my brother to reconsider because she had become \"attached\" to him and wanted to marry him. However, my brother firmly told her that it wouldn’t be the right decision and that they couldn't move forward. It took her some time to accept the rejection, but eventually, she did.\n\nThe issue now is with her father. He hasn’t stopped calling my dad since they got the news. My dad doesn’t answer because he felt bad rejecting a \"nice\" family, but at the same time, he knows there’s no point in discussing it further, as my brother’s decision is final.  \n\nToday, we found out that the girl’s father had already informed the people in his \"community\" that his daughter was going to get married. Apparently, in their community, once a girl is introduced to a potential match, it means the arrangement is final. He also mentioned that his daughter has refused to consider any other matches and has threatened to commit suicide if she doesn’t marry my brother?? Wtf\n\nI just want to know if they can file any legal case against us. Thank you ",

However, the guy from LIC housing finance is saying that I will have to submit the original documents to their branch for which they will give me a signed and stamped List of Documents submitted from my end and then will submit the documents in their Head Office.

The LIC guy says that they cannot disburse the loan amount from the branch and head office people have the authority to do the same. Hence this procedure is followed in LIC housing.\n\n  \nPlease help mates.",

However, on **Day 1**, I suffered a **serious injury (Grade 3 ankle sprain -complete rapture of legament & hairline fracture)** while playing. The issue is not just the injury but **how the academy handled it:**\n\n1. The **coach saw me fall but did not assist or offer any medical help. Instead asked me to move out of the court and asked me to go home and sleep and by morning it would be good.** \n2. When I went to the **academy office for first aid**, they **had no ice pack or spray (Move spray was out of stock).**\n3. I had to **go home on my own, without any help or medical attention.**\n4. Later, when I visited a doctor, I was diagnosed with a **Grade 3 ankle sprain and a hairline fracture**.\n5. I reached out to the academy for a **refund**, but they said they have a **\"No Refund in Any Circumstances\" policy** (this is written on the bill/receipt).\n6. The **person I spoke to refused to give me phone number, name etc of the owner**\n\nI feel this is **clear negligence** on their part since they **failed to provide basic medical assistance** to an injured player.\n\n# My Questions:\n\n1. Can I **file an FIR** under **IPC Sections 336, 337, and 338** (negligence causing harm)?\n2. Can I **file a case in Consumer Court** under the **Consumer Protection Act, 2019**, for **\"deficiency in service\"** and demand a refund + medical expenses?\n3. Since their **No Refund policy** is written on the receipt, will that prevent me from getting a refund legally?\n4. If I **post my experience on social media** (Google reviews, Justdial, etc.), will that help put pressure on them?\n5. Any other legal options I should consider?\n\nWould really appreciate any expert opinions or experiences from people who have dealt with similar cases.\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "text": "Context about my Uncle:\nMy maternal uncle has long-standing mental health issues—hallucinations, paranoia, and talking to himself—but he refuses treatment and has never been officially diagnosed. Outwardly, he appears independent, managing daily life, but those who spend time with him quickly notice something is amiss.  \n\nHis mistrust in family stems from an incident decades ago when my grandfather attempted to admit him for treatment by spiking his drink. Since then, he has been deeply suspicious. But he was always unemployed and was dependent on my granddad. So While my grandmother was alive, things remained stable. After her passing, he inherited a significant sum, moved out and distanced himself. \n\nMy granddad died of cancer. Even days before passing way he wanted my uncle to be happy and called him to write his will but he never cooperated. After my grandfather's death, we got to know my uncle had hired a lawyer with a notorious reputation( even before my grandad passed away). Despite knowing the proposal from his lawyer was unreasonable, we agreed to it. However, a day before signing, my uncle insisted on drilling a borewell on the partitioned land. To avoid disputes, we asked him to wait until after the partition, which led to a heated argument. His lawyer then called off the deal, followed by false cases against us (all dismissed). Since then, my uncle has refused any communication, and all attempts at reconciliation have failed.\n\nWe had filed a partition suit and his lawyer did not make a single proposal on how he wants this to be split. Despite us letting him know we are ready to settle in any way that they want and to pay him some amount for him to drop it. It felt like he wanted the case to be dragged.\n\nProblem:\nWe got to know recently that despite barely spending anything, my uncle is nearly depleted and we he is selling another property and the lawyer is facilitating it. The man has barely 3 bulbs and a fan and lives In a farmshed which is barely 200sqft. He doesn't own any appliances, vehicles or has any other expenses, doesn't eat fancy or buy fancy. For him to burn through his money raises a lot of suspicion on him being exploited.\n\nThe partition suit is now in its final stages after years of unnecessary delays. My uncle remains isolated, deeply trusts this lawyer (who suspiciously doesn’t charge him as per him), and rumors suggest he may have been unknowingly married on paper to exploit him (tbh sounded far-fetched to me dont know the truth here). While he has no spouse or heirs, we want to ensure his assets are protected from external exploitation.  \n\nAnd the funny part is we are on good terms with him on all matters expect his lawyer. We have attempted to warn him multiple times.\n\nSince he has no official diagnosis, courts recognize him as fully independent, making legal intervention nearly impossible. Are there any legal avenues to challenge this situation? Could undue influence or financial exploitation be grounds for action?  \n\nWe’ve prioritized our mental well-being, but watching this unfold is frustrating. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

They also quoted an extra ₹200 for writing the affidavit and another ₹200 for notarization.\n\nSince I can’t afford the extra costs, I ended up only buying the stamp paper for ₹110.

I feel so helpless. \n\nCan any advocate help me how to tackle this situation? I'm so scared that I'll end up like my dad! :(",

Meanwhile, my case seems completely ignored—I haven’t received a single rupee.\n\nI’ve sent multiple emails regarding this issue, yet no response from the concerned authorities. The lack of transparency and delay in disbursement is affecting students like me who were relying on this amount to cover essential expenses.\n\nAt this point, I’m unsure what steps to take next.

Is there a better way to get their attention?\n\nThis is a significant amount, and many students are left in uncertainty. Any advice or guidance would be deeply appreciated.\n\nPlease help!",

Here’s a summary:\n\nBackground: My sibling (S) and cousin (C) have been manipulating and emotionally abusing me since childhood. This started when I was around 8-9 years old and has continued to this day.\nSibling’s Behavior: S has always been jealous and manipulative. She would use information I shared with her to manipulate me and others. She would play mind games, blame me for her actions, and turn family and friends against me.\nCousin’s Involvement: C lived with us due to her parents' circumstances. Initially, we were close, but S manipulated C into participating in her games. They would ignore me, provoke me, and turn others against me.\nEscalation: When I was 15, an incident occurred where C made sexual advances towards me. This led to a complex and confusing situation where we both engaged in inappropriate behavior. Later, I believe they used this incident to accuse me of sexual assault, turning the family against me.\nCurrent Situation: I am now isolated, facing psychological torture, and unable to progress in life due to their constant interference. They have spread false accusations, leading to social and familial ostracization.\n\nLegal Questions:\nWhat legal actions can I take against S and C for defamation and emotional abuse?\nHow can I prove their manipulation and false accusations in a legal setting?\nWhat steps can I take to protect myself legally and emotionally from their ongoing harassment?\nAre there any legal resources or organizations that can help me navigate this situation?\nI appreciate any legal advice or guidance on how to address this issue.

        "text": "I was looking for a good gym to join in Gurgaon. The closest one was Gold's Gym listed on the Cult Fit mobile app. It had no photos/videos, and no free trial slots available either, so I checked with the support team to see if the space is even functional. They confirmed it is, and asked me to visit the gym and ask the trainer to have a look around. Did just that, only to find that no such gym exists at the location tagged on their app. Asked around in the area, thinking maybe the marked the wrong location, but no one had heard of any gym in this locality. I was surprised because this had the classification of a 'luxury' gym and the subscription package was different than the others (more expensive). And this was the \\*only\\* gym of this category in Gurgaon (acc. to their own classification system), meaning if someone did end up buying the package, they wouldn't be able to access the thing they paid extra money for.\n\nI contacted the support team and they have since removed this listing from their app but for quite some time, it had an active payment page, meaning anyone could have purchased it.\n\nMy question is: Is this considered fraud or intention to fraud under Indian law and can any legal action be taken against them?",

        "text": "I (36 f) have been separated from my husband (40) for over a year now. He is an alcoholic who was physically, verbally and sexually abusive. I told my parents about his abuse about 6 months before I was able to leave him. My parents and I talked about me leaving him, but i was also afraid to take a big step. We have 2 kids also 6 y o and 2 y o. My parents live abroad while I lived with husband and his family in india. My parents told my maternal uncle about this and he had told me to let him know if i needed help. \n\nIn Nov 2023, my husband and I and kids went to a family wedding and my uncle was there. He took my husband aside and scolded him and told him he should be good and stop drinking or else my uncle will help me get away from him. My husband was deeply offended that my uncle scolded him and when we came back from the wedding, his abuse and torture escalated. I immediately called my parents and they flew down to india, and along with my uncle and another uncle who is a lawyer, they brought the police. I wrote a police complaint (not FIR, only written complaint as a letter) and left with my parents, along with my kids in early December 2023.\n\nI went with my parents to the country where they live, and i was fully transparent to my husband and his family about where we are. They do video calls with children at least 5 days in a week. Husband knows our address and has ordered cake and toys for the children a few times in the last year. Just to add, he has not sent any money or anything like that since we left and i have not asked either. I started working again (i had stopped before marriage) and i am sending my kid to school and managing other expenses with my parents help. My parents don't live in a western country where it is difficult to get visa or where flights are expensive. Visa is on-arrival for $50 and there is a direct flight from mumbai. My husband and inlaws are upper middle class and well able to afford it. I have invited them all to come and visit the children whenever they want. I don't want anything to do with them but I have no intention of keeping the kids from them.\n\nEvery other week, my husband sends random ranting messages to me insulting me and my family members and friends. Recently he started messaging disgusting things directly to my family and friends too. They all sent me screenshots and i told them to ignore and block him. Only i have not blocked his number for the sake of the kids. Last night he sent a message to me that my uncle tried to r*pe his sister two years ago when we had gone to my parents' hometown (in india) for my 2nd delivery. He has been angry at my uncle because of his scolding, and every now and then he calls him derogatory names, but this is going too far. His sister is a 42 years old and unmarried but in a good job and a smart woman. I sent her his message screenshots and she said 'so sorry, i will scold him'. He obviously sent this without her knowledge. It's bad enough he is defaming my uncle, but also his sister? \n\nAnyway, i guess her scolding also hasn't helped because he is continuing to say the same thing about my uncle, and also saying my uncle might have tried to do the same to his own daughters (he has 2 daughters). I have ignored all of his other disgusting rantings (he called my father a chakka, and my sister a prostitute for working night shift - she is an emergency doctor), but this is really unbearable for me. \n\nCan I file a defamation case just from his text messages?

Here's the full picture:\n\n* **Exam Schedule & Delayed Internship Application:** We had theory exams right up until January 30th, meaning we couldn't apply for internships before this date.\n* **College's Very Short Holiday:** My college only gave us a very short holiday from February 1st to 17th. This is crucial because internships are usually longer than just a few weeks.\n* **Delayed Internship Approval (Company & College):** I applied for an internship, but both the company's approval process and the college's internal approval took a significant amount of time.\n* **Internship Start Date (After Holidays):** The internship was finally approved with a start date of February 19th to March 21st – after the very short college holiday ended. This is a 30-day internship.\n* **HOD's Refusal & Unrealistic Suggestion:** Despite the internship starting after the holiday period and being a standard 30-day duration, the Head of Department (HOD) is refusing permission. They are saying no special permission will be given, and incredibly, suggested I attend the internship after college hours.\n* **Impossible Commute:** My commute to the internship office is approximately 3 hours each way. This makes the HOD's suggestion completely unrealistic and practically impossible. It's also not an online internship.\n* **Core Problem:** The college gave a holiday that was far too short to accommodate a proper internship, and now the HOD is blocking me with an unworkable suggestion. This feels incredibly unfair, especially since the delays in approval weren't my fault.\n* **Seeking Urgent Advice:** What can I possibly do? Who can I appeal to? This internship is really important for my career, and the HOD's stance seems completely unreasonable given the circumstances. Any suggestions on how to get permission would be greatly appreciated!\"",

Despite knowing little about Suraj—aside from having seen him around for years—we thought it was a good opportunity.\n\nWe ended up paying a total of 15 lakhs as an initial payment on a 40 lakh deal:\n\n* **5 lakhs** via direct bank transfer\n* **10 lakhs** withdrawn from the bank and given to him\n\nLater, we learned that the shop was actually with the bank and was about to be seized. When we confronted Suraj, he claimed that the money was meant to retrieve the shop from the bank. But soon after, the bank sold the property to someone else via auction.\n\nNow, after 10 months, Suraj has only returned **7 lakhs**. Initially, he promised to pay back **2 lakhs per month** and even gave us a bearer cheque (with no date) stating he’d call us when we could deposit it. This worked for about a month, then he switched to making online transfers—**1 lakh** for some months, then **50 thousand,** and for the past two months, nothing at all. Saying he doesn't have money now, he stays in a flat near us.\n\nWe’ve consulted one lawyer who suggested sending him a notice, though I’m skeptical it will make a real impact. As I’ve often read here that lawyers, in many cases, just try to stretch things out to fill their pockets and keep the process going for as long as possible with no output. My dad’s friend (who originally urged the deal) has now backed out, saying he tried his best but couldn’t help.\n\nWe do have 4 cheques of 2 lakhs for the remaining amount and a handwritten, signed letter from Suraj acknowledging receipt of the money.\n\nHas anyone been through something similar or have any practical advice on legal steps, negotiation tactics, or any other avenues we might pursue? Any suggestions or shared experiences would be incredibly helpful.\n\nThanks in advance for taking a couple of minutes to help out!",

        "text": "\nTo give the background, my father bought a 1020sq ft (15x68 ft) plot 25+years ago. Person X has also bought identical plot adjacent to ours. They built a temporary house (kachha makan) on their plot and we built permanent house parallel to their house. At this point there were no other houses in the vicinity, just two of us.\nAfter some years, we got to know that our houses are crooked and went into neighbours plot. So, most of the part of our house went into the person X plot and person X house went into person Y plot.\nThen my father and person X went to person Y in order to buy their plot and end this dispute. Person Y kept neglecting and delaying to sell. Later after some years, person X built somewhat better house at the same place. Later on we also extended one room on our plot. Till this point person X and us were on the same page to buy person Y plot and end the dispute.\nBefore a couple of years, person X came to us and asked to go to person Y to buy their plot since person X wanted to build permanent house. So, we went to person Y and multiple rounds of discussions. In the end person Y agreed to sell it at somewhat lower rates than the market. Person X then backed off from buying saying I’ll build my house at the current location only. (Earlier it was decided that person X will buy some part and we will buy the other part) So, we bought the entire plot.\nBefore a month of so, person X demolished their existing house, came to us and asked now I want to build my house what do I do. We said you only wanted to build at the current location so build there. So he agreed, but after a few days again came to us that I want undisputed land and all. So, we asked him to shift to the edge of person Y plot which we bought plus we came to an agreement that we will also give 55k as compensation (this compensation makes no sense in my view but they constantly blames us that we built the house and so they have to do adjustments, so my father said let’s end this by giving them some compensation) they agreed to this. But that requires sub division, to move out 1020 sq ft plot out from 2000sq ft. Later on they backed off from this also saying we won’t shift to that place giving ridiculous reasons.\n\n\nTo summarise, we are agreed to person X’s demands still they are not satisfied with anything, we agreed to give them same plot adjacent to their current plot which won’t have any dispute additionally agreed to give compensation as well. Still giving ridiculous reasons they are backing off.\n\nWhat legal actions can they take given our house is there on their plot since 25+ years, they also had their house in some other land but they demolished inorder to build a new one, so they conveniently demanding anything they want? If they go to court what could be the verdict?\nWhat legal actions can we take on this?\nAny legal advices to us?",

It all started 4-5 months ago when my cousin (her mom) found out that my niece was texting him. He’s the relative of one of her friends. When my cousin found out, she punished her and went to the boy’s house to talk to his parents, explaining that he’s an adult and my niece is just 12. They promised it wouldn’t happen again, and we all thought everything was resolved.\n\nToday, my cousin and her husband visited our home, and I wasn’t fully aware of the situation until now. My cousin shared that she’s still suspicious and caught my niece chatting with him again, this time through a hidden app. I figured out the password for the instagram and went through their messages, and what I saw completely shattered me. The innocent and loving image I had of my niece is gone. They met once in person, and there were explicit photos of them kissing. He’s an addict and a pervert who’s been grooming her, but he manipulated her into sending nudes, sharing porn, and even forcing her and emotionally manipulating her to send him money for alcohol. I literally lost it and vomited after seeing their sexting. As an adult, I would think twice before engaging in something like that, and she’s just 12.\n\nI showed everything to my cousin and her husband, and I strongly urged them to take legal action because she’s a minor about to turn 13, and he’s 21.\n\nI need advice on what we can do to bring this situation back to normal and what legal steps we can take. Any help or guidance would mean a lot right now and also which subs will be helpful if i post it there.\n\nEdit: Not my niece's personal phone she doesnt have one she's using my sister's phone andher grandma's phone. sorry i wrote not solely blamming the boy thinking someone might put blame on us for blamming the boy only as shes also equally involved not in my correct senses since morning.",

        "text": "Hi Redditers,\n\nI'm 34M working with a US company in Hyderabad for 12.5 years now. I've always been a reliable employee and was promoted 3 times over my tenure. However during the FY24-25 due to changes in my personal life and where my org's vision is heading, my performance has been less than mediocre. Due to cost cutting and other reasons, this year my org is planning to shed 50% of their capacity by putting more people on a performance plan, tightening the rules and not giving any pay hikes.\n\nSadly, I'm one of those who is on a performance plan right now. While my manager is supportive and is willing to bring me out of it, I see no future with this org and I decided to not fight it, take the lumpsum and leave. According to the current HR and Legal guidelines, if I leave under a performance plan, I'm eligible for (1) Gratuity bonus for my tenure (2) Leaves encashment (3) Salary compensation for me to sustain before I find another job.\n\nWhile the company cannot touch or modify 1 & 2, I'm hearing rumours that 3 will be completely eliminated due to cost cutting in my org. Based on the current policies in my company I see that the compensation is a calculation based on my tenurity and previous performances, but it's not clear how much or how it's calculated. I've talked to people with similar tenure who left on a performance plan in the previous years and they say that I'm eligible for 7-8 month pay as compensation. \n\nIf my org decides to give me the stick and not give me #3 at all, I'd like to know if I can proceed legally to get some pay. I have screenshots I captured yesterday of the policy which states I'm eligible for a compensation based on my tenurity and previous performances (with the date on when I took the screenshot).\n\nIf proceeding legally will not bare any fruits, I'd rather resign, get 1 & 2 and keep my re-hire status as \"yes\" because if they fire me my re-hire status would be \"no\" for the next 5 years. \n\nI'd appreciate any help in this matter. Thanks for reading.",

        "text": "Hi all.\n\n\n\nSo my friend (primary guarantor) approached me in Nov 2022 to become a secondary guarantor for a secured business loan of 1.6 Cr (8 years tenure) for his father (borrower). Having worked with their business in 2019, I obliged to help since their business was working okayish and they were expanding. They also bought new machineries. Although that big amount scared me but my friend assured me that there is \"no need to worry\" and this is \"just for formality\". And they have a good relationship with their bank (co-operative bank) since many years. So I signed all the relevant documents in good faith and \"to help\". Yes, looking back, I was naive.\n\n\n\nAnd then I go about living my life and forget about it. They did not tell me whether the loan started and even I didn't inquire. They didn't give me any sanction letter as well. Note: I didn't have much salary in 2022 and 0 credit history (genuine question, why and how does a bank even approve such cases where guarantor is \"poor\", have no assets or personal wealth which can reimburse such a huge amount)\n\n\n\nUnaware, loan commences from Jan 2023. My friend and I don't talk since May 2023 due to some other personal issue. However there is no problem with his father.\n\n\n\nEverything is good until Jan 2024, I apply for a home loan and my bank tells me that I can't get a loan since I'm a guarantor in a business loan and it has irregular payments and a SUB (substandard) state.\n\n\n\nI call them and ask for a reason for the irregular payments. His father tells me the business is not working well and he is in talks with other nationalised banks for takeover (transfer loan to other bank) and for CC limit with current bank. I call his father back after a month. He says to call back in March since he is still in talks. I am furious at this point and since I don't have any control and feel that since he's been a businessman for soooo long and his relationship with bank is good, he will figure something out. I decide to wait more and give him time. I call back in May. Same response. I call him back in July, same response. He asks me to call back in Sep, I wait and decide to call him in Nov instead. He asks me to call back in Dec end. \n\n\n\nAt this point, full year's payments have been missed. I get a notice from bank in Dec beginning that loan has NPA'd in Aug 2024. I also get to know that there is another loan of 1.4 Cr signed by other guarantor. I also get a call from random bank asking me if I can contact my friend since he's missed the EMIs for his car (\\~40 lakhs) although I am not a guarantor in that (I checked the CIBIL reports myself).\n\n\n\nI decide to give his father a break and another benefit of doubt that he might be sorting this out. So I call him 2 months later, ie this month, Feb. He says he's still working on the takeover to nationalised bank.\n\n\n\nBut my patience is over. They are \"good\" people (I have seen them invest in good machineries for which they look loans and are expanding the business), but it seems to me that they have taken advantage of me and other to get loan approval (since a secondary guarantor could have been his wife as well or some other family member). I know they are more in agony than me which is why I decided to be calm about this, but like I said my patience is over now. A random google search also told me my friend, this time, has borrowed 9L for his own company and her mother as a guarantor and even that has NPA'd in Nov 2024.\n\n\n\nI know I am late but hopefully not too late asking for help. I know guarantor cannot be changed unless there is takeover. But I doubt nationalised bank is going to approve this because if it did, this would have been over already.\n\n\n\nSo what legal steps can I take to safeguard myself from bank screwing me over? ",

        "text": "I was working at a small agency back in 2014, where my employer never paid full salary on time and when I stepped down he gave me a post-dated cheque for my pending salary (~₹35,000). The cheque bounced, and I filed a case in Saket Court, Delhi.\n\nThe issue was that the court kept asking for the accused’s address to send a notice, but he had moved from the address I had. I couldn’t find his new address, and after 15 months, my lawyer suggested that my case would be dismissed due to my failure to provide a valid address. I asked him to close the case.\n\nRecently, I came across this person’s LinkedIn profile, where I found the name of the company he has started and his new office address. However, he has a history of frequently changing his office locations, and on LinkedIn, he only mentions working at \"Confidential.\"\n\n\nThe irony? He has started a law firm, despite having no legal background.\n\n\nSince I don’t have any documents with me (they were all in the court records), I want to know:\n\n1. Is there any way to reopen my case and pursue my dues?\n\n\n2. Can I retrieve my case documents from the court?\n\n\n3. What legal options do I have now to take action against him?\n\n\n\nWould appreciate any advice from legal experts!",

I was also told by Flipkart customer support that once I receive refund from brand then Flipkart will initiate the process\nfor cancelling the 3 year complete warranty. \n\nI was then told by Flipkart to contact Jevees for the refund and they said to contact Flipkart for the same. Now, Flipkart is denying refund for that citing laptop hasn’t been returned via Flipkart.\n\nI filed a company on consumer helpline website this was their response:\n\nHi, Greetings from Flipkart! Order ID: OD432445499764556100 We are sorry for the trouble caused. We certainly understand your concern. We would like to inform you that since the product was delivered on 05 Oct 24, it is post 10 day Return policy. Due to this sorry to inform you that the seller will not be able to initiate the refund request of the product. Hence, closing the complaint from our end as per the policy. Your kind understanding and cooperation are appreciated. Thank you.\n\nThe case has been disposed by consumer complaint this was their response: \n\nThe Company has responded to your grievance.

        "text": "\nHi all \n\nI’m writing on behalf of my sister who is facing this dilemma (with everyone’s “obvious” choices making decision-making hard). I’m hoping I can get some help from this community here for the same. \n\nQualifications: NLIU Bhopal third year student. \n\nShe has represented her college at many regional moots and has now got the opportunity to attend the Oxford moot. Their team qualified for the international round but it clashes with their end-term exam dates. She has been getting first rank in every semester so far (with a good margin between her and second place holder) and is on track to be the 5 year aggregate topper. The problem now is that if she attends this moot, she will be giving her exams with the retests of next semester (“deemed first attempt” it will be called) but that will rule out her eligibility for the gold medal for the no. 1 rank holder. \n\nShe has been talking to seniors, some alumni, mentor-like figures but I’m hoping this community will help us get a wider reach with academics too. Personally I feel she should attend the moot as it would be a great opportunity for the exposure, the networking and experience it offers , but it is not my decision. \n\nSo my ask is to get your opinions on these few considerations:\n\n1. Assuming she remains the aggregate topper at the end of her course, how much difference does it make if she is the no. 1 rank holder but without a gold medal?\n\n2. How much value would you put on an international moot like at Oxford? \n\n3. Considering she would pursue higher education after her NLIU course, \n\n   (a) if immediately after NLIU, she would be sending applications in her 5th year. She would have had no medal confirmation yet. How much would a gold medal matter then in her future endeavours? \n\n    (b) if after few years of work, how much weight given to gold medal / batch topper achievement, vs her work experience? \n\nI feel like there’s a lot of things that might be obvious to the community or considerations that you might not even think important. But my sister has been scratching her head over this for a few weeks now and the time to make a decision is approaching fast. Any input here will be very very appreciated. \n\nThank you. ",

So, I call 112 and they send two police officers.\n\nThey told me that since I called, I have to accompany this person to the hospital on an ambulance. I was willing to do that.\n\nThen they told me I would have to take care of this person after the hospital until any of his family members show up. They implied something along the lines of, if he passes then I would be held responsible in some way. I then pleaded that I was a student in a PG and couldn't do that much. That I just saw someone that needed help and informed 112. After pleading for some minutes, they let me go. This whole incident made me feel unsafe for just being a responsible person. The whole time I was also on the phone with an ambulance.\n\nI feel many people don't do the right thing because they are scared of facing this interaction.(At least a 100 people would have walked past this guy. This happened in a very crowded place) I don't want to be scared the next time that I report some incident like this.\n\n(I read about some Good Samaritan Rules on the internet, but I am not a lawyer, and would like some clarity on how to handle this type of situation and my rights, that's why I am asking this question)",

        "text": "I recently found a 9-year-old resale flat in Bengaluru on NoBroker. The seller had opted for NoBroker’s postpaid service, meaning I couldn’t access his contact details or property documents until I paid a **₹2L token advance**. The email I received from NoBroker clearly stated:\n\n*\"In the event of any issues with property documents, legal concerns, or loan issues that prevent registration, the paid amount will be fully refunded without any deductions.\"*\n\nAfter negotiating through NoBroker’s Relationship Manager (RM), I brought the price down from **₹95L to ₹85L** and agreed to proceed. On **Jan 30**, I paid **₹2L** via NoBroker’s payment link (confirmed in my bank statement). The seller received **₹1.4L**, and NoBroker took a **₹60K commission** (confirmed by Seller). NoBroker sent me a receipt as well two days later.\n\nOnce I got the property documents, my lawyer found that the building **does not have an Occupancy Certificate (OC)** since it was built before RERA and falls under BMRDA. My lawyer even asked for a **Completion Certificate (CC)** as an alternative, but the apartment association didn't have it**.** This was a dealbreaker for me, as OC/CC absence impacts resale value and could create legal/loan issues. After some discussion, the seller agreed to my decision to back out.\n\nOn Feb 19, I emailed NoBroker requesting a refund as per their policy, citing the **lack of OC/CC as a legal concern**, and even submitted my lawyer’s **Title Search Report**. NoBroker has not responded to my emails for **three days** and, over a phone call, denied the refund, saying *OC is not a legal requirement for registration, so backing out is my personal choice*. The RM even **lied**, claiming the full ₹2L went to the seller (I confirmed from bank statements that it passed through NoBroker).\n\nThe **seller is refusing to return the ₹1.4L**, saying he lost a prior deal at **₹80L** because NoBroker convinced him to accept my **₹85L offer**. He paid **₹1.6L** brokerage to another agent, so he considers my ₹1.4L as *compensation for his losses*.\n\n# Legal Questions:\n\n1.  Is NoBroker legally obligated to refund me based on their email? Was it even legal to charge ₹2L just to provide seller details & documents?  \n2. Can **OC absence be considered a legal concern** that prevents registration?  \n3. If NoBroker refuses to refund, **can I take legal action**? Under what charges?  \n4. Can I **file a case against the seller** since he received my ₹1.4L via NoBroker and is now refusing to return it?\n\nWould appreciate any legal insights! Happy to answer any questions.\n\nPS: Using a throwaway account to post this.",

My only point of worry is that University essentially is a place of education they should not have any right/ business against the ongoing cases of a students or any controversies they are facing if it is not connected to uni itself.\n\nThis essentially different from employment bcz here the student has paid money to get admission and study and they are essentially providing a service. The important point is issue is not connected to University.\n\n||\n||\n|||",

        "text": "I’m caught in the dreaded 90-day notice period at Accenture (India) and I’ve cooked up a two-step strategy to try and break free early. I’m curious if anyone’s been there, done that, or thinks I’m just dreaming.\n\nStep 1: The Medical Excuse Gambit\n\nI plan to visit a doctor and get a certificate citing stress-induced insomnia and anxiety. You know, the usual symptoms—racing thoughts, sleepless nights, constant fatigue, maybe even a few dizzy spells. The idea is to have a legit note that recommends immediate rest (and by extension, early release from the notice period). It’s a subjective diagnosis, so hopefully, it’s hard to argue with.\n\nStep 2: The Labour Law Drop\n\nIf HR resists my early exit request, I’ll gently remind them that Indian labour laws require notice periods to be “reasonable” and not create undue hardship. I’m not going full threat mode, just casually mentioning that I might have to consult the Labour Commissioner if things get too sticky. The hope is that this little legal nudge will push them to approve an early release rather than risk a bureaucratic headache.\n\nMy Burning Questions:\n\t1.\tHas anyone successfully shortened their notice period using a medical excuse at an Indian IT firm?\n\t2.\tDo HR folks actually verify a doctor’s note, or is it more of a “trust us” scenario?\n\t3.\tDoes a subtle mention of the Labour Commissioner work as a scare tactic, or is it just empty talk?\n\t4.\tAny other creative, legal loopholes that helped you escape the notice period grind?\n\nDrop your experiences, advice, or even cautionary tales in the comments—I’m eager to hear if this strategy is a genius escape plan or just another wild idea doomed to fail. Thanks in advance!\n\nP.S. This is purely a brainstorming session—I’m not a lawyer, but I’m all ears for any feedback from those in the know!",

I checked out this place few days ago and absolutely LOVED it. Although it was a little over my budget, I still went ahead. I spoke to the flatmates for almost 2 hours and didn't find any red flags and thought everything is as per my needs. \n\nI even put down a token amount of 25k before leaving the apartment when I went to visit. But the next day I did some math and realised that paying deposit, maintenance, rent and the setup cost for the apartment was too big of an amount (1.2 lakhs total upfront) for me to put upfront and that it is not a wise financial decision  to lock a big amount like that. \n\nSo I called the owner the next day to tell him I'm no longer interested and that he should refund my token amount. And he refused saying tokens are non refundable and that I should find a replacement and he would consider the token paid. \n\nHis property manager forwarded me this message earlier today\n\n\"The token is always non refundable as was conveyed to her prior transaction. The decision on her part was made after thought. \n\nA relatively big amount was quoted so that we don't entertain non-serious prospects and avoid situations exactly like this one.\nWe declined other people because of her and we face the loss due to her careless and hurried decision. She was not forced to put down the token, she did so as a functioning adult capable of taking decisions. \n\nIf decisions like this could be flipped, then what purpose would token amounts serve? It would be useless to collect tokens.\n\nThere are only two things we can do for her here:\n1. If she is able to find someone to take her spot from March 1st, we can accept and consider the entire token amount to be given to us by the replacement.\n2. We can refund 20k to her from our end if and only if we are able to find a replacement by March 1st. The 5k will be withheld as penalty charges for our losses.\n3. If we are unable to find a replacement by March 1st, the 25k is forfeited.\n\nHer unprofessional behaviour has cost us convertible leads. And hence there must be compensation for the same. \n\nIncase she disagrees to this arrangement, clarify to her that this is a civil matter not a cybercrime matter and that she should file it in the civil court. She will hear from my lawyer if and after she chooses to do so.\"\n\n25k token amount is big amount for me and cannot afford to lose it. What should I do? Any advice and help is highly appreciated.\n\nThanks",

I waited for a few days to see what's happening. There is a moderator called \"Rajiv Jain\" in the group that everyone calls \"Professor\". He tells which stocks to buy and sell. The weird thing is that he advices Upper Circuit stocks and \"Block trades\". If you know anything about stocks, you would know that you can't purchase Upper circuit stocks. And block trades are just direct discount on stocks! He says to buy them and sell next day. All the shares are held 1 day, some special trades two days. They emphasize to sell on time and not hold as it is against rules. This is what they say \"Please buy today and sell after the opening of the next trading day. It is strictly forbidden to expand profits. Once illegal operations are found, they will be blacklisted and all cooperation will be terminated\". So how do you participate in these trades? You need to open a \"Primary Market account\" with them it seems and download their app. \n\nNow I did something really stupid, I know. I went ahead, gave them my PAN card, Aadhaar card and downloaded their app from a direct link (not on playstore). So I transfer them 1.75 Lakh (over days and over multiple transactions). Let me tell you how these transactions worked. You contact Customer support (another whatsapp group). You tell them how much you want to transfer and they tell you which bank account to transfer to. The bank accounts change every time because there is a 100 crore limit on them and they need to change accounts every time it seems. They are never HSBC banks, some small banks accounts.\n\nThe amount is reflected in the app. Let me tell you about the app. It looks like a legit app, you can see the live stock prices (though they seem to update slowly like every 5 mins). When you buy the stocks, even UC, you are immediately granted the stock and sale is also immediate. There is no setting of buy/sell price, always market. For a few days, I followed the trades, made money on the app. The process of withdrawal is to put a withdrawal request and they will either approve/reject it. To test whether withdrawals are working, I withdrew 1000 Rs, it went fine. Few days later, I withdrew 40k, it also worked fine. So my confidence has grown a bit that this might be legit.\n\nNow, here are the reasons why this sounded legit. All the members on the app are always positive, there is never a negative message, everyone is praising, posting screenshots of their trades, of their profits, of how much they deposited. There are a 100 members in the group. I think it is difficult to have this many co conspirators. At least 20 to 30 different people chat in the group actively. But some people were randomly removed from the group too, don't know why. And people were posting screenshots and physical receipts of bank transfers for tens of lakhs of rupees. This moderator Rajiv Jain explained what primary account is, why they are able to get block trades (discounted stock) - as they negotiate with companies - apparently the shareholder are unable to sell on market as that would cause stock crash, so they sell to us at discount it seems (But what was the point if we sell the next day anyway). He also daily explains different concepts and during budget, he gave some insights, so they are at least  very knowledgeable about financials. They also provided a SEBI registration number: INZ000234533. But there were some suspicious things too. Like the discounts are huge. Initially they started at 6%-7%. Later, 10%, 22%, and recently, 33% discount. All big names, ICICI Lombard - 39% discount, ICICI securities - 51% dicount, HDFC - 33% discount. But you need to buy minimum of 10L to 1 crore for some of them. \n\nWhere I got screwed hard: So the third type of trades they do is IPO trading. I was told to apply IPO for Quality Power Electrical Equipment Ltd. Well, I did that. I went to the IPO page, clicked on apply, Weirdly, there is no bidding amount, how many share, nothing. I just got a screen saying submitted. I didn't think much of it. Now 2 days back, I get a message from customer support saying I won the IPO allotment, and I was allotted 2700 shares at 10.8 Lakh rupees. I don't have that much money in that app. I open the app to see my money is zero (All 2 Lakh I had was paid for the IPO it seems). I tell them I can't pay that amount. They reply: \"Hello, according to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) \"Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements (ICDR) Regulations, 2018\", after the IPO allotment is completed, the allotted investors must pay the full amount according to the allocated amount, otherwise they may face risks such as account freezing and future IPO subscription restrictions.\" I had one day to make payment, I obviously didn't do it.\n\nI registered a cyber crime complaint on 1930 (2 days back).. They took details of my transactions. I get this weird message from cyber cell today: \"Dear Sir/ Madam, Status of your Complaint Acknowledgement No. (redacted), dated 19/02/2025, reported on Cyber Crime portal is amount of Rs. 655 has been Put on Hold. Kindly contact your respective Police Station. Regards, National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal.\" What? Why was my money put on hold? I go to police station, they say to get print out of the cyber crime complaint, but I don't see any option to get print out of my submitted complaint. Have to go again tomorrow to resolve.\n\nThings got worse: Tonight, I get this message: Since you have not completed the IPO subscription, in order not to affect the listing of the stock, we have repurchased your account. The repurchase terms are as follows:\n\n1. If you are temporarily unable to pay the IPO subscription funds, HSBC Securities will repurchase\n\n2. Since you violated the regulations, your credit score will drop to 75 points after the repurchase, and it can be restored after completing the repayment\n\n3. If you complete the payment within 5 working days, there will be no additional fees. If it exceeds 5 working days, interest will be adjusted according to the current interest rate\n\nThis is very scary if real. I asked for where are the terms and conditions? They just send me pics of some documents (which look legit) but they refuse to send online link as apparently there is no such link. I ask for speaking to management or asking for office address. They say they do everything online and I can't meet management as it is not feasible.\n\nConclusion I made. This is either a fully scam operation and they are scaring me into sending more money or they are some legitimate financial institution with someone doing illegal activities. If it is the latter - It is really HSBC Securities who are essentially creating false loans with terms and conditions I didn't accept, I think I am royally F\\*\\*\\*ED\n\nI am planning on going to police station again and also go to local HSBC branch to maybe find some answers. If anyone has any advice, please suggest. I know I did stupid things.",

My son unfortunately killed himself to suicide due to the problems he had after losing his money to gambling on stocks and indices and crypto.\n\nWill the parents be bearing his unsecured Personal debt? \n\nICICI - 10L (14% Interest rate)\nHDFC 3.4L (18% Interest Rate)\nHDFC - 90k (15%) \nHDFC credit card outstanding - 2L\n\nTotaling up to around 17 Lakhs.\nHe was making 46k per month and had a total EMI of 36k.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate :\n\nThanks to everyone for sharing your inputs. Yes, the post is by the \"son\". I'm (24M) tired of this world. Even if it weren't for debt I guess I would've still considered this, debt and quitting job just accelerated my decision making. I've prepared my exit procedure and just wanted to clear a few things before I go to avoid further burden while I'm gone. \n\nI've cried plenty of times at almost every comment shared by people stating that I would hurt my parents when I'm gone.. true.. I won't disagree.. but I know time will heal the emotional pain caused by my death. I've gone through enough posts of r/suicidebereavement to know that healing is possible after this loss and my parents can move on and that's enough for me to give enough reassurance to go on with my decision.\n\nI have a gambling disease. Soon I will start taking loans from other NBFCs and loan sharks or heck I'm capable of even risking my parents'hard earned money and might even lead to them selling their blood sweat built house and other materials to bail me out which would mean a world to them.\n\n Don't wanna live in that world, sure I've failed them as a son but don't want to impact and also project my failure and impact their life's hard work... I'm not going anywhere.. I'm just becoming part of this earth back again.. we're all star dusts after all... I've experienced everything... I've lived my life... Too lazy to fix the problems honestly...\n\nI have never been a good son to my parents or a good partner to my gf who attempted to fix me but failed so hard and hurt themselves too and my Manager at work who had no business or actual need to care about my problem went out of his way to give me enough time despite me deliberately slacking off for several weeks or months on end and yet he kept me and I had to step in our of guilt and applied resignation and lied to him that I'll file for Bankruptcy and still he even helped me saying he'll give 1 month mental health break etc or if I'm sure about declaring bankruptcy then he said he can shorten the notice period down from 2 months to 1 week and I chose 1 week.. end of next week I'll be out of salary too which will motivate me further to proceed with the exit plan.. I had plans of running away from home to like mountains and just live off grid but I don't think my snowflake ass raised in the comforts would adapt also not to forget the trauma I would've caused to people around by just running away, if i don't get killed by the harsh surrounding of living life like that I'd for sure die off guilt..\n\nI just can't change anything about myself for good. Everyone's attempt to get me back on track has only led to wasted time and them getting upset. I've never been a man of my word. Heck never even man enough to face trouble too... I'm done blaming everyone else but myself it's time I realise the root cause and kill it. So hence proceeding with killing the root cause. I have lost all hope... Life is stupid. I might be around for another week or two as materials for my exit plan are on their way. One small temporary pain my family will go through in the next few months and they'll enjoy the rest of their lives.\n\nAgain thank you all for giving me a good cry. Needed it.\n\n",

After checking with some people I know, they said this kind of sale does happen, so I proceeded.\n\nWe signed a contract on ₹50 stamp paper with the following terms:\n\n1.\tFor the purpose of buying the bike he/Party A has gotten amount X from me.\n2.\tThe vehicle will be transferred to me within 15 working days.\n3.\tThe vehicle would be in initially said condition and properly working.\n4.\tThe seller is responsible for transferring RTO-related documents to my name.\n5.\tIf these conditions aren’t met, the seller will refund my money.\n\nAlso have a copy of His voters ID\nHad to pay the money upfront because it was using this that he would get it the from bank.\n\nAlthough the contract stated 3 weeks, the seller initially informed me he could complete everything within a week. However, the process kept getting delayed with various excuses—some more convincing than others. After the 15-day period, he asked for 1 more week, promising a refund if he failed to deliver the bike. I agreed.\n\nThe week passed and I gave him a warning, stating that I would take legal action if I didn’t receive the bike or a refund within 2 days. He responded with another voice saying he’ll do it by  over the weekend.

        "text": "We are a young couple in our early 30s from Bangalore. Building our own house was a dream, and three years ago, we bought a plot with a loan from an NBFC (since it has a Panchayat Khata). A 55kV high-tension (HT) wire runs about 10 feet from our site but does not pass directly over it.\n\nAfter registering the plot, we searched for a reputed construction company to build our G+2.5 triplex home, keeping the HT wire in mind. We chose Company X based on their marketing and claimed experience (800 standalone projects completed). The total construction cost was agreed upon, including all taxes, and any extra costs for material changes would be our responsibility.\n\nBoth parties signed an agreement. The company conducted a site analysis, soil test, and feasibility check, confirming that G+2.5 was possible. They committed to completing the project within 12 months and provided a phased timeline. Their payment structure required us to pay only after completing each phase.\n\nInitially, construction progressed, but there were deviations from the approved plan. They assured us these would be fixed later. Then, suddenly, all communication stopped—our site engineer, coordinator, and escalation team ignored our calls for two months. When we visited their office, they claimed workers refused to continue due to the 55kV HT line.\n\nThis was shocking, as they had previously approved the design. After much discussion, we agreed to remove one floor, reducing it to G+1.5, and they resumed work. However, they kept delaying construction, leading to a total delay of six months beyond the agreed timeline.\n\nWhen we confronted the management, they refused to compensate us despite a clause in the agreement stating that delays would make us eligible for compensation. They also ignored our complaints about construction quality. Now, they are demanding additional GST due to miscalculations, even though we had agreed on a GST-inclusive price.\n\nThey still have our money for an unfinished phase and now claim they will complete the project by April, which means an 8-month delay.\n\nHow can we take legal action without spending too much?\n\nSome friends told us that court hearings could cost around ₹35,000 INR per session, which worries us. We want to know our legal options if the work is delayed further or if there are quality issues. Any advice on handling this situation legally and effectively?\n\nTL;DR: Hired a reputed builder for our G+2.5 dream home in Bangalore. They confirmed feasibility, signed a contract, and promised a 12-month timeline. Midway, they stopped responding for two months, citing a 55kV HT line issue (which they knew about earlier). We had to remove a floor (now G+1.5) to resume work. They kept delaying, resulting in a 6-month delay, and now claim it’ll be done by April (8 months late). They refuse compensation, ignore quality concerns, and are demanding extra GST due to their miscalculations. Legal action seems costly—what are our best options as consumers?\n",

While the petition was being filed in the court lady who was doing the filing raised the concern that her name on the Aadhar Card (‘A D E F’) does not match the name in the divorce petition (‘A D F’) and she also went on to say that the name that will now come in the final decree will be ‘A D F’.\n\nWe are fully paranoid about this incident and don’t know how to proceed. Our lawyer is blaming us for this error and not guiding us on the next steps. Is this mismatch a major issue? Do we need to withdraw the petition and file a new petition again? Does something need to be done right away? Or we can wait until later?\n\nI would really appreciate your advice in this regard. Many thanks in advance for your time and valuable suggestion. In case it helps, the case was filed last week and in Pune Family Court.",

        "title": "KIIT's Dark Underbelly: Systematic Negligence & Cover-ups Exposed",
        "text": "I want to begin by clarifying that this post is not intended to harm KIIT University's reputation but rather to shed light on incidents that students have witnessed during their time at the institution.. Many students choose to remain silent because, in the end, they just want to graduate and move on. This silence has allowed numerous serious incidents to remain hidden from the media and public awareness. First and foremost, it is essential to acknowledge that this is not an issue exclusive to KIIT. Many private universities in India operate in similar ways-lacking transparency, suppressing voices, and prioritizing reputation over student welfare. However, as an alumnus who has personally witnessed these incidents unfold, I feel the need to document them so future students and their families can make informed decisions.\n\nIn November and December of 2022, two suicides took place within KIIT. One occurred on November 20 in Boys KP5 Hostel, and another on December 6 in Boys' KP15 Hostel. Both had personal reasons, but the concerning part is not just the lack of media coverage. Every time a suicide occurs, by the time the body is discovered hanging, students are kept away, and untrained KIIT staff are sent instead of professional medical personnel. The body is left hanging for over half to one hour, during which staff take photos and videos before roughly handling it. In many cases, they drop the body as if it were an object, wrap it in a bedsheet, and drag it away. Students attempting to document these moments are threatened with disciplinary action.\n\nA similar incident happened in December 2022, when two female students from KIMS attempted suicide by poisoning. They were rushed to KIMS and barely survived. Another suicide occurred in a girls QC hostel, but unlike the boys' hostels, where at least some rumors circulated, this case was completely silenced. The administration cut the power supply, called in their private security force, and transferred the body without allowing any recording or documentation. Only the deceased's roommates knew what had truly happened.\n\nKIIT has pattern of labeling these deaths as heart attacks to avoid panic. They take possession of the body, bypass police involvement, and conduct internal post-mortems at KIMS to ensure no external Investigation contradicts their claims. While preventing panic among students may be one reason, the administration has begun to exploit this approach to protect its reputation.\n\nIn February 2023, an incident in QC4 Hostel mirrored the infamous Chandigarh University scandal. A girl was caught recording another girl while she was bathing, taking advantage of the poorly designed common washrooms with open-top doors. When confronted, it was discovered that she and her boyfriend had been selling such videos online. The affected students protested, demanding strict action, but instead of supporting them, the warden dismissed their concerns, telling them, \"It's not your video that was Leaked.\" The administration then assisted the accused in escaping serious punishment. Within a month, they were back in class, and the matter was silenced.\n\nOn March 18, 2024, a major food contamination issue occurred in KP15 Hostel. Due to negligence by the hostel mess authorities, over 40 students contracted jaundice, and one died while being treated at KIMS. Yet, once again, the university avoided accountability. The student's death was officially classified as a \"natural cause,\" and instead of addressing the root problem, they merely issued a warning to the mess staff without making any real changes...\n\nKIIT's approach to handling such cases follows a troubling pattern. First, they suppress the news, ensuring it does not reach external sources. Second, they silence students through threats of disciplinary action. Third, they manipulate the cause of death or incident details to avoid responsibility. Then, they protect the perpetrators rather than the victims.\n\nStudents at KIIT have observed how the institution maintains its fabricated reputation through bribed rankings and manipulated statistics. The ranking system itself has raised suspicions, as KIIT's high placements in NIRF, THE, and NAAC appear to be influenced by strong political connections and financial dealings rather than genuine academic excellence. Placement statistics are often exaggerated, with outdated or fabricated data used to portray a better image. The research culture at KIIT has also been questionable. Many professors publish multiple peer-reviewed papers every two months, which is an unrealistic pace for quality research. Students who have looked into these papers have found citations in completely unrelated works, making it clear that these publications are not as legitimate as they are made out to be.\n\nThe recent case of the Nepali student's death has been the first instance where KIIT failed to suppress an incident. Initially, KIIT staff forcibly removed Nepali students from campus using local security personnel, but after international attention-particularly from the Nepalese Prime Minister-they had no choice but to backtrack. Suddenly, the administration pretended to cooperate, despite earlier intimidation tactics. Videos have surfaced of staff, the founder, and even professors threatening. students to protect the university's reputation.\n\nI am not writing this out of personal grudge against KIIT. These incidents have happened, and students are aware of them. The reason people don't speak up is that they just want to graduate and leave. This normalization of injustice allows these institutions to continue operating with impunity.\n\nIf you witness an incident, document it. Even if you cannot act on it now, evidence can be useful in the future. Universities should be places of learning, not fear. This post is not about spreading hate-it is about ensuring transparency and accountability in private institutions across India. Every student deserves to know the reality before making one of the most important decisions of their life.\n\nIf this post reaches someone from the media, investigative organizations, or legal authorities, please consider looking deeper into these matters. The students and their families deserve transparency and justice. The normalization of such incidents should not continue unchecked. Peace.",

        "title": "Caught a Thief Who Stole ₹1.95L from My GF’s Dad, but Now the Cops Are After Me – Need Advice",
        "text": "Hey everyone, this is my first post, so please excuse any mistakes. I’m 22M and a second-year law student at Delhi University.\n\nEarlier today, my girlfriend’s dad went out to buy groceries and ended up befriending someone. Unfortunately, this guy saw his debit card PIN, stole the card, and withdrew ₹1,95,000 in multiple transactions. We only realized what had happened in the evening.\n\nWith the help of a mutual friend who had been with them, we tracked the guy down. He was acting innocent and even came with us to the police station, pretending to help. The police also suspected him and registered our complaint, asking us to return the next day once they check the cameras as it was too late and the stores and ATMs had probably shut. After that, my girlfriend’s dad did not come with us.\n\nSince we were sure he was the one, we bluffed and told him we had CCTV footage. That’s when he confessed and agreed to return the money. But soon after, he switched off his phone. Panicked, we searched for him all over Sector 56, Gurgaon, and even asked the police to check his house around 11 PM. They told us to go home, but just as we were leaving, the mutual friend informed us that the thief was planning to escape to Jammu.\n\nAt this point, we had a choice—leave it to the cops (who had done nothing so far) or take action ourselves. Despite being scared, my girlfriend, her mom, and I decided to go out one last time. I knew the risk involved, but I wasn’t going to let him get away. We eventually found him in Sikanderpur, one of the sketchiest areas in Gurgaon. This place is known to be a red-light area, and it was definitely not safe for my girlfriend and her mom to be there at that hour. As soon as the thief saw me, he ran. At that moment, I knew I had to act. I chased him down, pushed him so he fell, and held him down while calling the cops.\n\nThis was honestly one of the bravest things I’ve ever done. I was terrified, but I still did what was right. In a city where people hesitate to step up, I literally did the police’s job for them.\n\nSeeing the commotion, some people nearby asked what was happening. When they heard that he had stolen money and was trying to run, around 10–12 guys gathered and started beating him. We tried to stop them (I even got punched in the process), but it escalated quickly. Under pressure, the guy returned some money and tried running again, which led to another round of beatings. Eventually, he gave back around ₹1,75,000.\n\nAt this point, we were genuinely scared. Sikanderpur is not a safe area, and with 12 unknown guys surrounding us, we were worried that they could turn on us at any moment or even run away with our money. We just wanted to leave. I spotted a police car and flagged them down. They caught him, and soon after, the officers from Sector 56 arrived.\n\nThat’s when things got messy. The police didn’t scold us—they outright told me that the thief would be charged with theft, and I would be charged with “maar-peet” (assault). It felt like a warning. I told them I didn’t hit him, but the bystanders did. The thief himself even told the cops that we didn’t harm him, and I recorded a video of him saying that. But the police looked pissed, especially after I recorded the video, and now they’ve asked us to come to the station at 9 AM tomorrow. They also suspect the involvement of the mutual friend.\n\nNow I’m feeling really anxious. I didn’t do anything wrong—I literally did their job for them. I was scared but still stepped up and showed courage. And yet, instead of being appreciated, I’m the one being threatened. We’re relieved to have gotten most of the money back and are fine with not pressing charges, considering the thief’s sad personal situation.\n\nWhat should we do now? Should we proceed with the charges despite not wanting to? Can the cops actually take action against me? They seemed really pissed off. Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nUPDATE: The parents went to the police station, around 20k are still to be recovered and the guy is saying he will pay back. I am not sure of the details because I am in college, but the parents have “thanked” the police people for being there yesterday, and nothing has really happened so far. I will update further.",

I was ready to pay, but it felt completely unethical.\n\nWhen I called again, the receptionist pretended to be someone else, saying “avara, avara” (acting like another person). When I asked for her name, she instead gave me the manager’s number.\n\nThe next day, when I spoke to the manager, he said it was normal practice and that ambulances must be paid for in advance, even in emergencies. When I pointed out that I got an ambulance from a much more reputed hospital without this issue, he was rude. I also mentioned that the lift wasn’t working when I went to visit my mom, and he casually dismissed it as normal.\n\nI am beyond frustrated! Anyway, I’ve decided never to go to that hospital again.\n\nSorry for venting out… is there any thing i can do on legal side\n",

I purchased a **Sony OLED TV (Model: XR-55A80J, ₹1,62,000)** on **November 14, 2021** from Croma. Recently, the TV developed a **panel defect**. When I contacted Sony, they admitted that the display panel needs to be replaced but **conveniently claim they cannot source it anymore.**\n\nInstead of honoring a **free replacement** (as they cannot repair the product), Sony India is **forcing me to pay ₹79,167 for an exchange with a new model.** This is a blatant **violation of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019**, specifically:\n\n• **Section 2(47): Deficiency in service** – Failing to provide necessary repairs or replacement for a defective product.\n\n• **Section 2(47)(ii): Unfair trade practice** – Forcing a customer into an unfair exchange instead of honoring their obligation.\n\nEven after multiple emails, Sony is **avoiding the words “defect” or “fault”** and refuses to acknowledge their responsibility. Their **scripted corporate replies** are carefully worded to **manipulate customers into submission.**\n\n\n\nI have already:\n\n✔ **Filed a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (NCH).**\n\n✔ **Initiated legal action through Consumer Court (E-Daakhil).**\n\n✔ **Started social media exposure & escalations to Sony’s corporate departments.**\n\n🚨 **This is NOT just about me.

If you want a working Sony TV, **pay ₹79,167 more**.”\n\nThis is **corporate bullying** and sets a **dangerous precedent** for all consumers. **If they get away with this, what stops them from doing this to others?**\n\n📢 **I need advice!**\n\n1. **Has anyone fought a similar case and won?**\n\n2. **What are the best ways to amplify this issue to ensure accountability?**\n\n3. **Any suggestions on further legal escalation?**\n\nI appreciate any support, advice, or suggestions!

        "text": "Hello Folks,\n\nMe and my brother have been very close. Last year, He told me about a setup where I lend money to his friend who runs loan business. In return, he will give me interest at 1.5% and also registers one of the land plot on my name. I knew his friend personally since childhood but not close with him. I didn't think much. But I wanted to be safe. I asked the guy to write agreement on bond paper so that if he tries to screw me up, it will hold up legally. Agreement basically states that interested has to be paid monthly and money should be return upon the notice after one year of the lending. I actually work overseas. I trust my brother very much and asked him to be the power of attorney and get this plot registered on my name. I checked with several people. This is legal and can be done. Now, plot got registered on my name but power of attorney was his friend himself. This I came to know only after I received the registration documents. When I question, my brother shrugged it off and said some bullshit reason. Right after this, my brother got married and started a business without even telling me. I suspect there was some kind of arrangement between them to dupe me. I called his friend asked him that I need money and he said he will arrange by June this year. Btw, I lent him money May, 2024. He hasn't paid any interest amount at all. When I asked, he gave all kinds of excuses. I verified the documents in government portal, the plot is on my name. My brother's friend is into politics and kind of has some influence. My worry is that, he may not return the money and won't let me sell the land as well to recover money.\n\nAlso my brother grew distance with me and started telling lies about most of the things. Things haven't been well between us. For all these years, I thought he is the only one I thought I could trust. But it's apparent that I got betrayed by own brother. I once bailed him out of debt of 4 lakhs and took care of him when he got sick and hospitalised. It feels like stab in the heart.\n\nNow I seek your folk's advice on how to challenge this legally. Or is there any better approach to resolve this and recover money. Also my brother's friend being the power of attorney has any implication for my ownership of the plot?\n\nAny lawyer willing take up this? Happy to share the details over DM.",

        "text": "On Monday: [Writing this with a disturbed mental state. Kindly forgive if any grammatical mistake happens and help me as soon as possible 🙏]\nHello everyone,  currently I'm a b.tech 1st year student. Actually my family is in a weird situation. It's really going to be a long writing so dividing it into the previous context and the main incident, kindly help, as per you knowledge.\n\nPrevious context: My father has one elder brother and one elder sister. So I am now nearly of age 19 and in my childhood partition of our home was done between the two brothers and his elder sister got Rs.50000 instead of plot in home map. After partition my father and his brother got one room each . As he moved out we had to bought his portion ( rather not as per our wish but forcefully) but no big problem with him after that. Grandfather took one room in the ground floor and he lives with us. My grandmother went to live with his elder son and it was all decided by my grandparents and their elder son only. Now if we talk about the family relations then actually my mother is from a poor household.  Her father expired during her board exams. Her mother did each and everything to raise and educate her well. Before they got married my mother went to do a typewriting type of work to a commercial complex , although today she is a state government school clerk.  In that complex my father also runs a business.  An advocate lady actually arranged their marriage. Now let us be very clear it's not like during their marriage my paternal family has very good financial condition but their(not including my father in anyway) behavior was like my mother came after seeing their \"financial-might\" . It was my father , who after knowing that she is highly educated got more interested in this relation.\n\nMonday's  incident : Now coming to our main topic, after so many years now my grandmother's relation with her elder son and his wife has worsened so much so that she wants to come here. Her elder daughter also does not have any good relation with her elder brother. She also wants the same but will never take her mother to her own home because there is the catch, she can only shout but can't take responsibility.  Few days before she had extremely heated argument with my grandfather over letting her mother in the house but my mother said after one had left the house no one will come here. Furious with this my grandmother,  who repeatedly along with her daughter cursed my maternal grandmother also several times before , went to her best-friend's house , which is just next to our house and told that she never wants to come to our house and also she wants that I will leave and andabandon my mother like this only. Today the mother-daughter duo directly came to our house. First they were arguing with grandfather with every kind of cursing words possible at such high voice that I was having an afternoon nap but wake up immediately.  After I and my mother went downstairs we also have an argument with them.Whole thing is recorded in my phone. They again stated bad words about my mother and maternal grandmother,  at the heat of the argument I was stated my grandmother as a dayin(witch) . Even don't know but how my grandmother fell to the ground and her daughter shouted that I pushed her and that happened . At last my father came home and drove them off from the house. \n\nConclusion:\nTbh we have no relation with them and will treat them like stranger . Just want to know if any legal  way available so that they will not come anymore. It's really hurting my mental state also.\n\nToday : They filed a diary. Tomorrow is the inquiry at police station.

For my  upcoming posts , I need to get some legal facts checked about the concept of speech freedom in our country. Personally , I thought we have the same level of free speech that US does , but I got to know I am wrong, so here I want to clarify certain things:\n\n1. Can you as an Indian have a personal opinion which is discriminatory but which you share in informal domain like social media apps ?\n\n(E.g : A lot of people have conservative or 'sexist' opinion about gender. Men and even women  about dressing , manner they talk  and conduct themselves , the ability to provide etc.  Apart from formal environment ,  Now if you talk about it on social media , will that be illegal to provide such an opinion ? )\n\n2. If someone makes a public post on social media , will commenting in trolling or roasting qualify as an harassment ? (Ofc giving threats is illegal and punishable and so is making sexual remarks on an SFW post , but apart from that )\n\nA simple yes or no answer will do , however if you can provide any explanation to NO's it will be helpful. \n\nThanks for reading\n\n\n\n",

At that time, she was the only way to get in contact with my crush. She has fun loving personality so we kind so got close like brother and sister. Fast forward, my crush and I are talking and everything going smoothly. My crush is at granny house for vacation after 12th exam. She has left her phone at her home. Meanwhile her best friend messages me at midnight two days ago. Greeted, chatted, she demanded some money and gave me a number to send there. I tried but it failed. I told her, I'll send in morning. She calls in morning, payment transferred. She mentioned that she needs to share something with me as she's not been honest with me about something.  I assumed money I have sent, goes to the bf. I told her if it is not related to my crush, no need to be honest. Everyone has personal life. She insisted that I have to tell you when I get free.( She's at sister's house for vacation after 12th exam. Same without phone). Everything passed by .... Yesterday I got call from unknown number in midnight. I was on another call, picked the call but no one answered. Same number sent some promotional message on WhatsApp. Didn't bother as I was busy on another call. Now today I got call from same number. Actual issue starts here. He asks if I know my crush? He mentions her sister name. Asks my name and whereabouts. I didn't give any information and denied that I don't know any of these persons.. He then says she's letting you to f*ck her? Other person then says if she's letting you f*ck her then it's alright with us. Hangs up. I called my crush with the help of her sister to her granny number. I let her listen to the recording. She heard everything and she's shattered. She has no clue who these persons are. But I mentioned the money transfer story so she understood that it is her best friend bf side related something. Now I have the recording. I want these guys to apologise to my crush or me. What are my legal opinion here? (All guys and girls that are mentioned here are 17-20 yrs age group except me(27)\n\n\nTldr: I sent money to my crush best friend bf, his friends called my regarding my crush and abused my crush.

Then he repaid the loan to the bank while dissolving partners A, B & C. Which means, his wife & daughter now owns 100% of the company. However, he did not register the property in the name of D & E, as he is under the impression that there are 2 partners remaining who automatically own all assets (movable & immovable) & liabilities of the company which includes the property too. \n\nOur lawyer mentioned that he needs to register a new deed with the municipality clearly stating the change of ownership of the **property** from the old partners A, B & C to the new partners D & E which will incur stamp duty (which he is trying to avoid paying stating it's an accepted practice).\n\nIs it wise to buy such a property where the deed/dolil still has the old partners and not the new ones? Is retiring of the old partners mean that the new partners automatically are new owners of the company AND the property as well without registering it? \n\nAny advice would be really appreciated. ",

        "text": "Hello, I am seeking legal advice regarding the recent tragic incident at KIIT University, where a Nepali female student reportedly passed away under suspicious circumstances. Reports suggest potential foul play, and there are allegations of institutional negligence and mishandling of the case by authorities.\n\nFrom what I understand, the university and local law enforcement have not been fully transparent about the situation. There are concerns regarding a lack of proper investigation, suppression of evidence, and possible pressure on the victim’s family and witnesses.\n\nAdditionally, reports indicate that when people protested against the handling of the case, Nepali students were told to leave the campus immediately, with many being evicted overnight. The eviction involved lathi charges, physical beatings, bruising, and other forms of excessive force. This action appears to be a violation of human rights and raises serious concerns about discrimination and arbitrary treatment of international students.\n\nWe also have recordings of the wardens speaking ill not only of Nepali people but also of Nepal as a country and our embassy. While we eventually received apologies, it was evident that these were primarily issued to protect KIIT’s reputation rather than as a genuine acknowledgment of wrongdoing.\n\nNow that the Embassy of Nepal has intervened, the university is calling all the students back, raising further questions about their motives and accountability in handling the situation.\n\nFor further context, here are some links to news articles and social media discussions about the case:\n\n* [https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/new-updates/kiit-student-suicide-police-arrest-21-year-old-boy-in-connection-with-nepali-students-death/articleshow/118344902.cms?from=mdr](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/new-updates/kiit-student-suicide-police-arrest-21-year-old-boy-in-connection-with-nepali-students-death/articleshow/118344902.cms?from=mdr)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bhubaneswar/comments/1is88l2/apology\\_video\\_by\\_manjusha\\_pandey\\_one\\_of\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bhubaneswar/comments/1is88l2/apology_video_by_manjusha_pandey_one_of_the/)\n\nGiven the gravity of the situation, I have a few legal questions:\n\n1. **What legal actions can be taken to ensure a proper and impartial investigation?** Would filing a writ petition in the High Court for a CBI or SIT inquiry be feasible?\n2. **Can university officials be held accountable for negligence or suppression of information?** If so, under what legal provisions?\n3. **What are the legal rights of students who want to protest or demand justice for the victim?** How can they do so while ensuring their safety and avoiding legal repercussions?\n4. **If evidence suggests homicide, what steps should be taken to push for a fair trial and prevent any political or institutional influence on the case?**\n5. **What recourse does the victim’s family have if they are facing coercion or pressure to settle or remain silent?**\n\nAny legal insights or recommendations on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, if there are any lawyers or legal organizations specializing in such cases, guidance on whom to approach would be helpful.\n\nThank you in advance for your advice.",

Recently, she crossed the line when she threatened to kill me and rest of my family. She has also started hurling things in our house during her fits. I have gathered evidence of both the threats to kill me and hurling things. I am frankly worried about my safety and thus I’m mulling legal options. However, I am also worried because I don’t have a prenup and my wife constantly threatens that she will pursue divorce, but she doesn’t. I believe it’s a tactic to induce compliance to her demands out of fear.\n\nWhat are the legal options I can pursue here? I’m worried about both my safety and divorce (being forced to part with a significant chunk of my hard-earned wealth will set me back quite a bit). I made a genuine mistake of misjudging her personality before marriage but I don’t think that mistake justifies being punished so cruelly. Nor should it justify being stripped of my hard-earned wealth or being forced to live in an environment full of constant threats. Please help me.",

        "text": "I’m dealing with a complicated situation at work and could really use some advice. Here’s everything that happened:\n\nI was working on a client project when I asked a colleague (who works for the client) for financial help. He escalated this to management because he didn’t want to directly say no. As a result, I was removed from the project.\n\nInstead of assigning me to another project, my employer claimed that a written complaint was filed against me for asking for money. However, to my knowledge, no such complaint exists. The only document they have is an offboarding form that lists the reason for my removal as \"behavioral issues.\"\n\nThey then asked me to submit a resignation letter. I didn’t want to resign, but they pressured me by saying that if I left the room without doing so, I would be terminated immediately. Feeling cornered, I wrote the resignation letter.\n\nThey also asked me to write an apology letter, saying it would help them reconsider their decision. I wrote the apology, hoping to keep my job or at least leave on better terms. However, they are now using this apology against me as evidence that I admitted to asking for financial help, even though there is no official complaint or evidence beyond this letter.\n\nAfter submitting my resignation, I requested the official 3-month notice period, which is clearly stated in my company’s policy. However, they are denying my request for the notice period, and I believe they are doing this to avoid paying me for those three months.\n\nI feel that:\n\nMy resignation was forced under pressure.\n\nThey are misusing my apology letter against me.\n\nThey are unfairly denying my official notice period.\n\n\nI need advice on the following:\n\nCan I contest my resignation since it was written under duress?\n\nDo I have a legal right to the 3-month notice period as per company policy?\n\nHow should I handle the misuse of my apology letter?\n\nHas anyone faced a similar situation, and how did you resolve it?",

My family was coerced into signing an unfair property agreement in 2021, and we are struggling to get justice.\n\nAt the time, the property was valued at around 3-4 crore, but my father, who is now 68 years old and facing severe health issues, was given just 15 lakhs for his rightful share. My parents were under extreme financial distress during the Covid crisis, and they were forced into a \"take it or leave it\" situation with no time to properly understand or read the agreement, which was written in Gujarati.\n\nMoreover, when the agreement was signed, the people who attended were all biased and were my uncles' people. No one from our side was present to help us or ensure that the process was fair.\n\nIn 2023, we sent a formal notice to my uncles, requesting our rightful share of the property. Unfortunately, they ignored the notice. Later, we filed a police complaint, and although the police initially promised to take action, nothing happened after a local influential figure, who is politically connected, intervened. This person has been helping my uncles avoid any responsibility, and when my father sought his help, he mocked my father instead of offering assistance. The individual told my father that he could file a case against him if he wanted, fully aware that we cannot afford to take legal action.\n\nWe are now in a very difficult position. Our financial situation is dire, and my father’s health is deteriorating . We have copies of all the notices we’ve sent, as well as the police complaint, but due to the political influence of this individual, we aren't getting justice we seeking for and we can't afford fees of an lawyer either. \n\nIf anyone knows a lawyer who might be willing to take this case or can offer any other advice or support, we would be incredibly grateful. We just want justice and our rightful share of the property.\n\nThank you for reading and for any help you can offer.",

        "text": "My friend is a director of a company and their payroll team mistakenly paid an ex-employee for 8 or 9 months after he left, due to a payroll error. The amount is between INR 80,000 and 1,00,000. The company had asked the ex-employee to return the money, they are not even asking for the PF, ESI, or other contributions. The ex-employee claims his father is in debt, so he is unable to repay the amount immediately.\n\nThe company has agreed to let him repay in 6 monthly installments, but they want him to sign an agreement and issue a post-dated cheque, which would only be cashed if he defaults on repayment. The agreement also mentions consequences under the Negotiable Instruments Act if the cheque bounces. The ex-employee is hesitant to sign this agreement, feeling it is too legal, but the company is willing to remove the fixed dates for payment, requiring only fixed monthly amounts.\n\nI want to help my friend as much as i can so the company recovers the amount from ex-employee as soon as possible.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1) What legal actions can we take if the ex-employee refuses to sign the agreement or defaults on repayment?\n\n2) Is the ex-employee legally obligated to repay the amount, even though it was a payroll mistake?\n\n3) Can we still charge him legally or recover the money without a signed agreement from the ex-employee?\n\nAny legal insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\n\n\nEDIT -----------------------------------\nI had phrased the og post improperly (Have edited it now) \n\nSome people thought my friend is the ex-employee who hasn’t paid back, and others thought I’m the ex-employee.\nTo clarify, my friend is the director of a new company, and I want to help him recover money from an ex-employee who hasn’t paid what they owe.\n\nAny advice or suggestions on how to go about this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

We didn't realize they would hire an overseas subcontractor (in India) to do the technical parts. After numerous delays and botched assignments, we insisted on getting more involved in the process, and found out the truth. The subcontractor is a small boutique company without much expertise in the task at hand. The project was going so badly that we had to involve our own developers for help (they don't know the subject either but have functional brains). Nevertheless, the project was nearing completion.\n\nA few days ago, we woke up to see that our website in progress is completely gone. At the same day, I was contacted by the subcontractor who said that our designers did not pay him *for other projects* and stopped talking to him. To \"fix\" the situation, he deleted all the files on our server (!!!) and wants me to pay him \"to complete the job\". When I asked, what is there to complete, he couldn't remember. (The correct answer is, their part was nearly done and what was left was beyond their level of expertise.)\n\nSo basically, he sabotaged infrastructure of his customer's customer who had no dealings with him.\n\nFrom the conversation with our prime contact, it appears that the subcontractor's team botched three other projects to the point that the customers walked away, but that they were paid the deposit.\n\nLuckily, the guy is as stupid as dishonest. The source code was copied so we restored it, and changed the credentials. Unfortunately, we forgot about one loophole. And, sure enough, at night he logged on again (through his normal login) and deleted more files.\n\nWe are currently restoring it, but assuming it might escalate, what is the best way to handle it? I doubt police will take care of something as trivial and relatively bloodless. Is there a way to blacklist them or something, beyond leaving bad reviews and listing as scammers?",

        "text": "Yesterday, between 2 and 3 AM, part of our house collapsed due to weakened wooden and iron support pillars. Thankfully, no one was harmed, but three bikes parked outside were damaged—one crushed, one dented, and one unharmed. A steel almirah was also destroyed.\n\nWe've owned this house for about 26–28 years after purchasing it from the previous owner. Over time, minor cracks appeared, but they worsened significantly in 2019 when we were away in Kolkata for my sister’s wedding. During that time, my father’s friends informed him that lights were on in a storage room (approx. 300 sq. ft.) with an entrance only from the outside. This was suspicious because we had cut off the power before leaving. A friend confirmed there was activity inside, and we later discovered that the adjacent mosque/dargah had illegally broken into the room, installed an iron door, and started using it as their own.\n\n[The Door](https://imgur.com/gallery/1kpkve0)\nOur lawyers advised us to take pictures and videos of everything happening around the house.\n\n\nThis wasn’t their first attempt at illegal possession. In the 2010s, they forged my father’s signature (in Gujarati instead of English) to claim ownership, which failed. This time, they bribed the previous owner's son and created fake documents, mainly focusing on the storage room. When we returned, we filed an FIR immediately, but the case has been dragging for nearly six years due to COVID delays and legal postponements. My father has all the proper documentation, but the mosque authorities have strong local influence. Unfortunately, friends who could testify in our favor are too afraid to get involved.\n\nThe unauthorized drilling of an entrance weakened the structure, ultimately leading to the collapse. We informed our lawyers, who advised us to file a panchnama, which we did on Saturday. Officials are expected to inspect the site on Monday.\n\nAt this point, we’re exhausted and stuck, unable to sell or move due to the ongoing illegal possession. How can we fast-track the legal process? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n[before the house fell down](https://imgur.com/gallery/uwncpWA)\n\n[After the collapse ](https://imgur.com/gallery/IpcNbIW)",

        "text": "My 27-year-old unemployed brother refuses to help at home, disrespects our parents, and blames them for his failures**  \n\nI don’t know what to do about my brother. He’s 27, unemployed, and doesn’t contribute to the household in any way. He doesn’t even do the bare minimum, like turning off lights when he leaves his room. He orders fast food every few days instead of eating home-cooked meals. He stays up all night on his laptop or phone and sleeps all day.  \n\nThe worst part is how he treats our parents. He blames them for his failures and never takes responsibility for his own life. Our father used to be strict when we were kids—he would hit him when he got bad grades—but he has completely changed now. Despite that, my brother still hates him and shows zero respect. My parents are fed up, but they still provide for him financially.  \n\nRecently, he had a breakup, and that’s when we even found out he was in a relationship. Even then, my father didn’t say anything, which is rare for most Indian parents. One incident really broke my father’s heart: My brother had to take a government exam in another city, and my father took him there. After the exam, my father was hungry because he hadn’t eaten all day, but my brother ignored that and went to meet his ex. My father waited for an hour before finally deciding to go look for him. He found him sitting in a park with the girl. He called me crying, saying, “This is what he’s doing.” It was heartbreaking.  \n\nNow, my brother claims that his ex cheated on him, and he even said he wants to call the police on her. I told him that men don’t have many legal rights in India regarding relationships, and it would only bring trouble to our family. Even after informing the girl’s family about what she did, he is still obsessed with knowing where she lives and whom she meets. He constantly gathers this information through their common friends.  \n\nAnd don’t even get me started on his anger issues. When I confronted him and told him that because of his behavior, our parents' mental health is declining—especially since they are not at an age where they can handle this stress—he got violent. He even hit me that day, despite the fact that I was the one who supported him during his breakup, listening to his rants and trying to help him move on.  \n\nWe even tried getting him into therapy. He went for about a month but then refused to continue or make any effort to change. He just doesn’t want to help himself, and it’s exhausting.  \n\nAt this point, I don’t even know what to do. If I say anything, he gets violent. My parents are not in a position to handle this kind of stress, and I feel helpless. Please, if anyone has dealt with a situation like this, I really need advice. What should I do?  \n\n",

        "text": "This is a follow up to my previous post that I made couple of weeks ago -\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IndianWorkplace/s/ziHJ0KCG72\n\nWe realised that the way to deal with a non compete clause situation is to have a business account setup in somebody else's name and then ask that person to send you that money in the form of salary through that business account. We are taking the help of a CA to set everything up and hopefully everything goes as planned.\n\nMy client is leaving my company on 28th of February, 2025 which means I technically won't have anything to do after 28th of Feb, 2025 in my current company but my HR is forcing me to serve a 2 month notice period. I'm telling her that I don't plan on getting trained on new clients only to train somebody else and that would be a horrendous proposition for you because you don't wanna pay me any money for training - you pay me money for actual work.\n\nTechnically my client leaves then I leave and that should be the end of the story but this notice period thing is another form of harassment from my shitty company to make sure that I don't get the chance to work directly with my client.\n\nHow to deal with this? Technically the purpose of notice period as far as my understanding goes is to - make sure you train a new person on your existing process and tasks etc. before you leave. But since my client is leaving the services of my current company, there is practically no need to train anyone on my process. Why tf is my company then harrassing me for this and forcing me to serve this BS notice period?\n\nI don't know if there is a provision to reduce or buyout notice period by giving them some portion of your salary back but for me this is pure and utter harassment.\n\nOn top of that, these people are telling me that they want in written that I wouldn't be working with my client directly. What should I do now?\n\nI'm stuck in this position right now and don't know how to deal with this?",

First through eJagriti. And when it did not processed due to technical problem (as said by commission). I visited physically with 3 copies to the court and +3 opposite party.\n\n> Background -- I am a student in engineering and has no idea of any legal thing.\n\n> My experiences --\n\n1. Learnt everything from basics on how to write index, proforma, memo, complaint, affidavit by own. No I don't have ant lawyer. Doing it on my own.\n\n2. I have collected every evidences and tried to put it all in the documents. Irrespective how small they are and how much weightage in the case. That increased the number of pages of the complaint. \n\nI had no idea court needs 3 copies of it and 3 to the opponent. That printing only costed me some ₹450 (it had color photographs as well).\n\n3. Once reached the commission to submit it physically. They asked me to tie all with a thread. AGAIN. I had no idea, took 30 min to do it. And once came back to office, they asked no, tie three separetly and other 3 separatly.\n\n4. Then they asked, where are the envelops? Only you need to buy and paste the postal stamps for the destination. (Now my files were already heavy)! It costed ₹145 per opponent party x3) for stamp duty. A4 envelop charges 6₹ each. (Indian post offices accepts only CASH!!!! No UPI)\n\n5. Once came back to commission office, they asked to open the threads and tie the envelops too with it. So I need to open and tie these too. \n\n6. Then they gone through the documents for corrections. I was in fear that what if there is correction now! Already given almost a day between this office and shops.\n\n7. Then the registrar signed it and I got the hearing date for next month.\n\n\n\nJust wanted to share it here. It was my first time so obvious I don't know the process and rules and regulations. \n\nBut also there is no plateform which can tell these things in advance. \n\nThe office people are also habitual of advocates filing the case so they were also first time telling someone, okay now go there, now sign here, now do this and that.\n\nMore importantly, I was in T-shirt and Jeans and it was mentioned at the entrance, no jeans tshirt are allowed!!!\n\nAnyways.

But what about academic certificates? Does he need to get updated ones? Since he’s only adding a name (not replacing the old one), he’s wondering if he can skip this step.

        "text": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI had purchased a home recently, which was in construction since 2021 in mumbai side. Last year we were in contact with A which was at camp which was setup by builders to facilitate interior design for customers. We got in contact with the designers with package for bedroom,kitchen and living room. Initially we thought it was good package which was around 3 lacs. So we went ahead gave initial token amount of 10k to designers but we were waiting for their inputs for long time we reached out to them again to know the status after which they asked to visit their main center to check out their interior and what package will include and overall details of the project. So based on the discussion we had discussed initial draft which had few things modified in their standard design. They started asking for money to start work of initial design which was 25k and as soon we would get the possession we would handover the flat for measurement. But builders had delayed the possession by 3-4 months which they were stating. So no work and no design was finalized as there were no measurements done. One fine day we get call from person  \"L\" company person that the project has been transferred to them from \"A\" and now i have to confirm the next steps. This person was working with company \"A\" earlier but now transferred to new company \"L\" and started working there hence project is also shifted maybe due to resource reduction. Initially i was doubful of this whole process on how they would shift project entirely to new company without my consent. They had setup a call with me on teams during which i told them even if they want to continue project they should provide me the same package mentioned by company \"A\" with changes i requested earlier. They said they will look into it. But after some days they were not responding then i decided to ask them what is the status as we got the possession. They replied you share us the detail what was discussed with company \"A\" and BOQ which ideally they should have communicated with them internally instead of asking me. Then i told them my expectations then person from company \"L\" started saying they cannot provide what i expected as i have to take the whole package instead of few changes and didnt want taking complete package at the price they were saying. So i said i want refund as they were adamant to not provide the required services. So i got their customer care email id. I mailed them regarding refund as there was no work done and design was not finalized. They completely rejected my request saying this will be accounted as part of design invoice.Mind you we have never  measurements done so design was never finalized and also no work was done but yet they are not giving back my money. Adding to the reply they sent screenshot of mail they sent me on 22 Jan 2025 that they are going ahead with project as per the given cost and design and stated that i didn't replied so i didnt had any concern. And main thing is that they sent this mail to unknown email id which i was not using. I replied them that the email you sent to the id is not mine and hence there was no confirmation from my side to go ahead with this project yet they are now on mute and havent replied after all evidences are against them. Please let me know what to do now they have my 35k.\n\nThanks",

Yesterday he ran down when the door was opened by the maid. \nHe was brought back within a couple of mins and had no interaction with anyone. \n\nSome uncle saw this and  now the association is making a big ruckus. \nIt started with a message on a WhatsApp group and suddenly a couple of hours later with no discussion with use or any sort of meeting or warning, the association said that u need to pay a fine of 10K in 3 days else we will take further action.\nObviously I refused to pay since this is very arbitrary and seems like bullying. \nI am a tenant BTW.\nNow they are messaging again to pay or face further action. What are my options here? What are the authorities I can approach for this ?\nAnd can the association levy such a hefty fine?\nThanks",

        "text": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceIndia/s/sY4BgqSoDu\n\nUpdate as per last post. \n\nCalled the police station, they said unless you have proof of it we can’t do anything. And the police enquirers about it with the men who were responsible but no actions taken apart from warning. \n\nNow new drama has started. And it’s escalating day by day and it’s spreading in the neighborhood. \n\nThe Lady, her daughter and the entire neighborhood is being verbally abused by this old man.\nThey have 2 house in the property. The entire property is owned by the lady. They have let him live in the old one. He has lots of property in his birth place and fertile land which he has asked someone else to look after. Apparently he was not kicked out of the main house, but he broke the lock of the old house and illegally moved in and police helped 🙂 (before Covid). He opened a bakery shop and it was doing well for sometime but then again he fought with everyone in the neighborhood and no one gives a F about him and no customers. So he closed the shop. His son tried to help him during Covid even though the father tortured him mentally and hit him to an extent where he broke a bone in his leg. The son is very depressed and he is a raging alcoholic because of his father and later he left to city for a job.  \nThe old man visits his girlfriends and sister’s house in the city and comes and goes whenever he wants, which is now completely stopped as they also kicked him out. \n\nHe is threatening to kill them all and burn the whole town. The words he uses are worst kind. \nFew days ago the Muslim lady gave them food and she opened the gate and came inside and he went outside the door where he lives and started abusing her for entering the property. \n\nHe started screaming “500rs for biryani - Friday special and pleasure everyone’, come to this lady’s house” . Entire neighborhood heard it.\nToday morning around 5:00AM he came and opened main gate wide open and entered the property and walked around the whole property and banged on the door, screamed and left. \nSince 12 pm he is non stop verbally abusing and going around knocking neighbors doors in hopes of making a scene but no is responding or opening the door for him. When he came to my house he almost pushed the door open and tried to barge in but my dad closed the door immediately and asked us to go inside. Seems like everybody in this town don’t want to be involved with this guy. \nThis is so unfair what the family is going through because of this man. \nInitial we all thought he didn’t deserve to be kicked out of the house, we thought the family used him and let him go. But once I sat with the daughter and heard the whole story, I understand now how domestic abuse is and how victims are made the bad guys. He has physically and mentally abused his wife, 3 days after they got married. His son was being beaten up when he got bored with wife. Surprised the daughter was never hit once. But he had emotionally tortured her. She got tired of seeing all this and left the house in hopes of a better life in 2014. Her brother stepped up and helped her with her education and stay. Now she is independent and takes care of her mom. \nNot once he tried to contact her or reach her out. He told the whole neighborhood and whoever he could find that she ran away from home with a guy and is a se* worker now. She came back to town almost a year ago. I have never seen any girl as strong, independent and conscious about things in life. She has a built life she wanted on her own and now She works for a reputed textile mill as a designer and she is earning pretty well and it itches him and every time he hears her talk to anyone on phone he yells saying her customer is calling. \nHe definitely doesn’t deserve a family like this. He has ruined everything he touches and keeps on hurting anything that makes him uncomfortable. \nIs it fair to let someone like this live comfortably in a society even if he is old (65-70) ? Why does the police always support the man if there’s no proof. Shouldn’t they be neutral and understand the situation first ? And the news is the old man has bribed more than ones.  \n\nI have asked the family to record as much as possible and have proof of all this and be strong and file an FIR. The relatives are brainwashing them to not file an FIR as it will bring bad name to the family. And neighbors are of no use. My own family says stay out of it, don’t get involved. \nThis boils my blood. \nI know I’m venting here, I wish I could do something. I have lost faith in the justice system. ",

She lives with her husband here and her kid is back in Nepal with her sisters and their kids studying.\n\nAny ideas on how to proceed in this case would really be helpful without the repercussions being that she faces any more abuse back at her place.

        "text": "\n25F I set a strong boundary that he should not go after my Bra, 31M he said “Okay”, but then he didn’t stop, after some mins, He unhooked it without my permission, I said No multiple times 10-15, I was clearly uncomfortable, he kept pressuring me until I gave in out of fear, for he didn’t stop, his words were, “Hey Hey Hey Please please Hey Hey Hey Consistently”…. and forced me to remove it under pressure by consistently ignoring my NO…, I gave in out of fear and I was scared and I just wanted to get through the night. When he hid my eyes and enjoyed himself, with his mouth on my breasts, I froze in Fear—I couldn’t move or react, Like a Dead Body I froze (trauma response) He didn’t care if I’m Okay, if I’m comfortable, absolutely Nothing, My eyes were hidden and he did it……. Then, I fawned (which is trauma response)—hugging and kissing him, trying to find comfort, safety, and trust in an unsafe situation. And again I froze when he kept his mouth on my breasts. I questioned him the next day that why he forced me, and he admitted that he forced me knowingly ( but he said it wasn’t preplanned and he did it on the moment, Anga yaara eruinthalum apditha agi erukum, his words were, any man would have done the same in that place, such a disgust comment ( what was I an Object ?, that’s how it felt ), He excused himself with his words “I did you wrong but I’m not a wrong man” “why did you allow me to your home”.\n\nEven If it wasn’t my home, it would’ve still happened to me in any other day, at any other place, at any other time. It doesn’t have to be my home at night. The least respectful thing, he could’ve done is value my NO, but to him, “his desire” felt more important than my consent and comfort. \n\nEven though he admitted to forcing me but then he shifted blame and avoided accountability and said, \"At least you should have stayed in control.\" ( I told him I feel unsafe and I wanted to be alone, rather than addressing my feelings of unsafety, this was his opportunity to say “Ennakum thaniya tha erukanum nu thonuthu”, He betrayed me in days shortly afterwards, like use and discard ). Days before this incident, at his home during day time, he tried to remove my top by force, I said NO, he tried to remove it again, I held it tight so he stopped, he said to me, It must’ve triggered ur past trauma, I won’t ever do like that again. I thought what a good man, I trusted him and respected him enough to allow him to my home, when he asked me if he can visit mine, but now as he got awareness that removing it on his own despite NO, is clear violation, he coerced me by consistently pressuring me into it….\n\nHis Friends made excuses for his actions and invalidated me saying, “Forcing is wrong but it’s not preplanned, it’s situational and another one said, he must’ve had different intentions.” \n\nHe admitted that he did not Love me and he made false promises of marriage recklessly. The fawning and freezing was trauma response. Fawning was my brain, trying its best to find comfort and safety in him, after freezing where I went absolutely Frozen, unable to move. ( Him repeatedly ignoring my NO caused me to relive flashbacks of my past SA from Childhood, I had Flashbacks of it, when he repeatedly ignored my NO that is how much he forced me). It hurts a lot the trauma, Couldn’t express in words, it’s been months, He is Ex Boyfriend.\n\nIs this legally considered as a crime, in India \nBut I feel like I’d probably be victim blamed. \nJust cause I trusted him to Allow him to my home, doesn’t mean I owed him Sex / Sexual Activity.\nwe both mutually agreed on our Limits, from the beginning of relationship. \n",

        "text": "I (18F) just can’t take it anymore. My parents are married for 23 years now. My mom, my siblings (mom 50F, sister 19F, brother 12M), and I have been living in hell for years.  It's all because of my father. Firstly he had no job for about 14 years after marriage, we were surviving on the rent we receive. We were always deprived of basic things yet father and grandparents boast about their money and them keeping us. But no one ever imagined my father would get into cheating. He will get into extra martial affair(s). The worst part? His family defends him, threatens us, and acts like we are the problem.\n\nIt started in 2017 when I was 11. I caught my dad chatting with a woman—our family friend’s mom—her calling him “Jaan.” I was too young to process it, but I knew something was wrong. My sister and I started keeping track, catching their flirty messages and late-night calls. We kept this secret long enough but two years later, we confronted the woman’s kids (who were our friends), and guess what? They already knew. Even her own son saw my dad sneaking into their house when no one was home.\n\nWe all planned to expose them. My mom didn’t believe us at first, but we gathered proof. When we finally confronted our dad and the woman in 2019, they denied everything. My dad fake-admitted guilt just to end the conversation, and life went on like nothing happened. But the affair didn’t stop. He kept choosing that woman over my mom, over us. He’s humiliated my mom in public, defended that woman over his own family, and even slapped me for speaking against them. He prioritized their kids over us.\n\nLockdown made things worse. The fights at home increased. That woman’s husband eventually found out in 2021 and moved his family away, but my dad still didn’t stop. By 2022, my mom had enough. He started confronting him and begging him to stop and not ruin the two families but he least cared. Then, last year, she caught him hugging our housemaid. That broke her completely. When she finally told my grandparents about it the next day of witnessing in July 2024, they blamed her. They protected their son, accused us of lying, and turned against my mom. They even stopped the maid from leaving.\n\nA big blow came when my mom confronted that woman’s husband. My father lost it. He came home unexpectedly right after 1 hour of my mom's talk with that woman's husband, packed his bags and left, blaming my mom for ruining his life. My grandparents threatened to throw us out and even warned my mom she could go to jail if anything happened to their “innocent” son. They never tried to make that man(father) realise his faulty behaviors but rather blamed my mom. Their, that woman's husband called her mom, beat her up, asked for a divorce. Meanwhile, my dad was out there drunk-dialing that woman’s kids, demanding to take their mom away with him\n\nMy mother thought that maybe this will end now but man never. This happened again, my mom caught my father again with that maid a few days back, this time she shouted at that instant itself. Grandparents defended their son again. \n\nMy mom wants a divorce, but she’s scared. She has no money, no property, no family to support her. My grandparents say we won’t get a single penny. And if we want to live, we(the children) can but my mother will be thrown away. My father is still involved with multiple women not just her but she is the main culprit, but no one sees him as the problem—only us.\n\nI can’t focus on my entrance exam anymore, my sister is juggling part-time work, and my brother is too young to understand the full extent of this. My mom is mentally exhausted, surviving only for us. We’re stuck, with no way out, and I don’t know what to do anymore. Anytime soon, anything can happen. I am not scared of consequences but the fact that I am in exam prep. I want revenge. I want to show them what they’ve done. We can’t keep living in this hell. It’s enough.\n\nHow do we fight this? How do we escape this hell? Please, any advice or help would mean everything right now.\n\n\n\nlong story short> My father is in extra marital affair with multiple woman but one to be main. His parents and him blame us for everything happening, threatens us that even if we file a divorce we will be left with nothing. They daily fight, shout, scream. We can't live in this hell anymore, any genuine advice would mean a lot.\n\n",

After that there had been several incidents which involved my dad beating up my own mother which had ended up badly such which like end up in breaking my mom's hand and back she's still in ayurveda treatment. Our family had been suffering from abuse from my own dad. Once I had supported my brother which the mistake on my dad’s side, my dad slapped my brother for the mistake which my dad did. In the evening my dad brought up the scene again saying lots of shit about my brother I couldn't handle the pain and got up and supported my brother. I said my brother didn't have a single mistake and it's better if I suggest dad to go for some treatment because treating his own children like slaves or prisoners ain't a good thing. My dad didn't like the approach I did my mom came to protect me my mom got a slap and I got angry and grabbed my dad threw him to the bed which ended up a bumb at his head but he got up fast and grabbed a knife which he almost came up to stab me but he dropped it after my mom screamed at him and he exchanged it for a belt and whacked me with and kicked me out of the house at 1 AM and I didn't regret the decision for supporting my brother. I left that house at that night and my brother came in the house after his work and got to know everything and he came running after me and hugged me crying that never ever someone supported me like this bearing beatings for me. I said like I couldn't handle he had to bear lots of things so I did my role as a brother. We walked for sometime and got inside the home at early morning 6 AM. By that time dad had gone for work, there had been a situation where it was a limit when I almost called 911 but he threatened me that if I get arrested now the day he gets out the jail he will hunt down us and brutally murder us and dispose the body.  The society  won't support us as they are big fan of him so they will think we are escaping because  are jealous of his successfullness. What should we do guys? Help us to solve this issue\n",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m writing this post on behalf of my friend **B.**, a student at NIFT Bhopal, who’s currently dealing with a horrible situation. I’ve watched her go through so much emotional distress lately, and I feel it’s important to bring this to light. It’s not just a personal struggle—it’s a bigger issue that we, as a community, should not tolerate.\n\n**Here’s the story:**\n\nA student from MNNIT Allahabad **KS** a 1st-year [M.Tech](http://M.Tech) student in the Electrical Department, has been relentlessly harassing my friend, **B.**, for weeks now. It started with phone calls that she tried to ignore. When she blocked his number, he didn’t stop. Instead, he began reaching out to other female students at NIFT, including the hostel warden, to continue his harassment.\n\nThis has caused my friend a lot of emotional distress. She feels unsafe, and understandably so. The constant anxiety and fear have taken a toll on her mental well-being.\n\nNow, I’m writing this not just to share what’s happening, but also to raise awareness and seek help for my friend. **B.** has reported this incident to the NIFT Anti-Ragging Committee, but what’s concerning is that the harasser is from MNNIT, which is 700 km away from us. This has made things more complicated, and my friend is worried that the situation won’t be taken seriously enough because of the distance between the institutions.\n\nSo, **what can we do about it?**\n\n1. **Speak up and raise awareness:** Harassment in any form is not something we should tolerate, whether it’s online, via phone calls, or in person. It’s important for all of us to talk about these issues openly so that victims don’t feel alone.\n2. **Support the victim:** **B.** has been brave enough to come forward, but she needs support. Whether it’s a simple message of encouragement, sharing similar stories, or offering advice, we can help make her feel less isolated.\n3. **Stand up together:** This incident is not just an isolated case. Harassment happens far too often in educational institutions, and it’s crucial that we all stand together to say \"enough is enough.\" If you’ve gone through something similar or have any advice on how to approach this, don’t hesitate to reach out.\n4. **Seek legal help:** We also know that this situation might require further legal action, especially with the involvement of multiple institutions. If anyone has experience with similar cases or knows of any resources we can tap into, it would be really helpful.\n\nI’m sharing this post because **B.** needs support, and I believe it’s time for us to start speaking out and supporting each other when we face harassment or any form of violence. No one should feel unsafe because of another person’s actions, especially in a university environment where we should feel secure and respected.\n\nPlease, if you’ve gone through something like this, or if you know how to escalate this situation effectively, please let us know. We need all the help we can get to make sure **B.** gets justice and to stop this behavior from continuing.\n\nThanks for reading, and let’s make sure **B.** knows she’s not alone.",

I confirmed with salesperson that batch will work on my ipad and will be activated immediately after money is paid. After the payment, I received the invoice, but my batch was not activated. I placed countless calls to customer support, but there was no proper response. More than 24 hours later, on Feb 22(next day) evening, after multiple escalations, they finally activated my batch. \n\nOnce the batch was activated, I realized that the course was not working on my iPad(my primary device, Playback issues) When I contacted support again provided them with all the proofs, tried troubleshooting, nothing worked then they casually told me to use an Android device, which is completely unreasonable because I did not pay ₹12,000 to be forced to watch lectures on a phone.\n\nI posted about it on twitter tagging them. Later that evening, a support representative called me again. They cancelled my ICONIC subscription, which was bundled with VIP, and told me that I would be refunded. But after that no follow ups about refund, neither in return about it. Now, my ICONIC subscription is cancelled, but my VIP subscription remains active.\n\nAnother major issue is that the teachers in this batch had clearly stated that they would not be accepting students after Feb 15 because the coursework is too intensive, and it would be difficult for new students to catch up. I agree with this, yet the salesperson still sold me this batch on Feb 21, knowing I would struggle. Now, the teachers are saying that new students should just watch recorded lectures instead of attending live ones to have understanding of whats going on in class. The whole USP of this course was personal attention and live classes peer to peer. So after all this hassle, I am now being forced to pay ₹12,000 just for recorded content. The salesperson told me a complete different story. \n\nI have already filed a complaint with cybercrime and raised a grievance with Unacademy, to which they responded they will try to fix for ipad. (no dead line, no statement addressing the refund which was my main concern). I agree I have been naive here and shouldn’t have trusted sales people. I don’t know what my next step should be. What legal action can I take in this situation? I have my JEE Advanced in 80 days and all this is so mentally taxing. \n\n",

        "text": "My brother was employed at an early-stage startup (seed-funded) for the last 4+ years as a developer. He was the 6th member of the company and did particularly well. Promoted and given a good raise every 6 months.  \n  \nA few months back, he casually mentioned to his co-founder that he was getting bored with the work and might look for a change for his personal growth. Nothing concrete, nothing in writing - just discussing his mental state with his co-founder as a mentee.  \n  \nSuddenly one day, around 45 days back, his co-founder and HR scheduled a call with him, asked him to leave on the spot and declined to pay any severance/notice period pay. When he objected, he was threatened that if he didn't accept this, they would hand him a termination letter instead of a resignation letter. No PIP, no discussion, no severance, no notice -- nothing.  \n  \nMy brother kept objecting, asking for his 2-month notice period pay in the email chain as part of his FnF. He was supposed to receive his annual bonus as well in the same month, which was again denied to him.   \n  \nTo make matters worse, these folks handed him a termination letter and the last 15 days paycheck with remarks - \"Terminated\". (Yes, they went out of their way to mention this in his last paycheck as well - so much for working hard to build something together).   \n  \nWe are looking for advice and recommendations for a lawyer who specialises in labour law to take this case forward. We are mentally prepared to take this to court.",

While I was referred by someone from one of the colleagues in X, the company requested me to join immediately. Since, I was working in a reputed institution already, I had to request them to relieve me early since I wanted to join this company X. The hiring team in X hired in a hurried manner and then after 2.5 months tells me that I have been discontinued. \n\nThe HR of the company informs me this, but not over an email or official letter. They informed me over a text message on MS Teams. Now, as shocked as I was, I wanted to check if a company can terminate my employment all of a sudden. After checking the appointment letter, I observed the points under separation section (points attached at the end of the post).  Upon asking the HR about the reason, I was told that since the project is coming to an end, they are discontinuing with people and my team management offered them names, including mine, to terminate our employment.\n\nNow, while I was employed on full time basis and not contractual, they terminated me as such. While I am looking for jobs, I am uncertain on my sustenance in the city without proper financial aid. Thus, I have a few questions and points looking for advice:\n\n1. Can the company terminate me just like that, giving me 15 days notice period, and informing me over a text message on MS Teams?\n\n2. When I had written an email to the entire management team including HR requesting for a written formal letter of termination along with the reason for such, I did not receive any reply to my mail. Instead, the HR again texted me over Teams saying that I was already told about the reason of my termination over Teams and why am I making a request over an email.\n\nThe separation clause had only the following points (writing the points since I can't attach images):\n\n\"*Given that this is employment at will, both sides would be free to end the engagement by giving a written notification.*\n\n*2. To ensure a smooth separation process being a confirmed employee both the parties has to give clear 30 days advance intimation. This notice duration cannot be compensated in any other form.*\n\n*3. No verbal or written communication from any authority other than undersigned or CEO can overrule this term at a later date*.\"\n\n3. Does my situation stand a chance as a case? If so, \n\n4. Can I receive any legal advice on my case?\n\nAny help or advice in this situation would greatly help me considering I support my family and I live alone here.",

I, nonetheless, kept making my payments on time and eventually ended up paying for the full treatment even before the treatment was over. Shortly after that, my orthodontist began ignoring me. She has no assistant and the clinic where she practises has no staff. I have to call her personally to make appointments with her. During the first few months, getting an appointment with her was very easy as her practice is very new and she has few patients (I only ever saw two patients in her clinic). \n\nBut since the past few months, getting an appointment has become a hassle. She refuses to take my calls. She doesn't respond to my texts. She keeps deferring the appointments even though I have been paying her a nominal fee for each appointment even after I already made the full payment. \n\nIn the past week, things have come to a head. My extraction gaps are opening up and some of my teeth have begun to rotate. I have called her several times to get an appointment. But she refuses to set up the appointment. I don't know what to do. It is not possible for me to switch to a different orthodontist as I have already spent a considerable amount for the treatment.\n\nIs there any legal action I can take against my orthodontist if not for physical harm, then for the considerable mental harrasment I have been subjected to since becoming her patient?\n\nPlease help!",

The details of the matter are as follows:\n\n1. Unjustified Financial Penalties\n\nStudent-run committees are imposing penalties of up to ₹10,000 for failing to attend mandatory events, missing form submissions, or skipping designated sessions.\n\nThese penalties appear arbitrary and lack transparency in terms of legal authority or justification.\n\n2. Collection of Penalties in Personal Accounts\n\nThe collected penalty amounts are being transferred into personal bank accounts of students managing these committees, rather than an official college account.\n\nThere is no formal documentation, invoice, or receipt provided for such transactions.\n\n3. Awareness of Faculty\n\nThe Faculty Chair of Student Affairs is aware of these practices but has not intervened to regulate or stop them.\n\nThis raises concerns regarding administrative oversight and possible complicity.\n\n4. Coercion and Threats\n\nStudents who refuse or delay payment are subjected to additional penalties.\n\nThere have been explicit threats that non-payment will result in exclusion from the placement process, which severely impacts students' career prospects.\n\nGiven these threats, I would like to understand whether this situation falls under Section 384 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which deals with extortion. If students are being coerced into making payments under the fear of professional repercussions, does this qualify as a criminal offense under IPC?\n\nGiven the severity of this issue, I would appreciate your legal guidance on the following points:\n\n1) Are such penalties legally enforceable by a student-run committee?\n\n2) What legal recourse do affected students have against such financial and professional coercion?\n\n3) What steps can be taken to report and escalate this matter within legal frameworks?\n\n4) Does this situation amount to financial misconduct or extortion under applicable laws, particularly IPC Section 384?\n",

        "text": "I am sorry if the post doesn’t make any sense as English is not my first language, and I am not in a good mood or normal mood. I (17F), my older brother (21M) and my mother (46F) are in deep trouble because of my father (49M). For context, my father had an extramarital affair, almost six years ago with a girl, who was a minor back then. Now, onto the issue. In 2019, my uncle, my paternal grandmother, and my father ‘gifted’ 14.2 acres of property, including our house to my mother, which means that my mother owns that much land. My father sold his share of the property and ran away five years ago, and to this date, refuses to divorce my mother. In 2022, my mother sent my brother to the UK for his bachelor's degree, as he was in his freshman year. In 2023, I also went to the UK to do my final years of schooling there, for which she sold some part of the property. However, my brother was sent back by his university because my father did not pay the fee, despite having the money kept with the remittance company sent by my mother. And, the same thing happened to me in 2024, where my mother had to sell her jewellery to pay my school fee, despite having the money with the remittance company, but my father took that money as well. Due to some legal issue, my father cannot leave the country, so, he was talking to the finance team, as well as the principal of my school. Now, we don't know what conversation they had, but, the principal wasn't convinced of taking me back to school, probably because my father might have misbehaved with the school management. So, my brother’s 2 years' worth of studies, and my high school studies have been destroyed completely because of him. Skip to today, as I am crying while typing this, my father sold everything which was given by my uncle and my grandmother, including the house where I spent my entire life. My father took money under my mother’s name, which we never received, nor did my mother allow my father to sell anything from her share of land. He also stole every single document related to the property, including my secondary school mark sheet. My mother lived with me in the UK till February, which, she went home in March (for 1 week) and in September (for just one day) to renew her visa (she was on a tourist visa), because my father did not allow her to stay back home for long. Now, my mother is suing my father for every penny he got for the land he sold under the disguise of my mother’s name, because he, and a lady who acted as my mother, took a lot of money, and we don't know what to do. I honestly don't know what to do with all of this going on. It feels like everything has vanished, destroyed to the ruins. I honestly wanted to get this off my chest, and also wanted to get some advice from Reddit. If anyone has any kind of legal advice or any advice in general, we would appreciate it very much.",

We were promised a completion deadline of July 2026, but it's clear that this deadline is unattainable as the developers have yet to obtain the necessary Occupancy Certificate (OC) from the government.\nTo date, we've invested ₹50 lakh in this project. Despite this significant financial commitment, we've received no concrete assurances or timelines for the project's completion. Instead, we're met with continuous delays and unfulfilled promises.\n\nThis morning, the developers spoke to a my family member and mentioned an outstanding payment, implying that we would be charged extra for not making the payment. We've consistently communicated our readiness to make the payment, provided they produce the correct legal documents required for construction from the BMC. They mentioned that they will deduct 20% of what we have payed if we plan to back off. \n\nFurthermore, after expressing our intention to withdraw from the project due to these delays, another consultant responded with yet another unsubstantiated promise that the project would commence in January 2024. We are now in February 2025, and the project remains stalled with no substantial progress or credible explanations.\n\nThe lack of responsiveness and accountability on their part is unacceptable. We've had to make numerous follow-up calls, often without any response, only to be met with false assurances.\n\nHas anyone else experienced similar issues with property investments? What steps did you take to resolve them? Any advice on how to proceed legally would be greatly appreciated. Also we are looking for people who have invested in Ruparel.",

        "text": "So a brief background. My first wife passed away many years ago when two of our daughters very very young. \n\nFew years ago I started dating another women and very early into the relationship she gets pregnant with our child. Initially as I had known her not for that long, so I refused to marry her. She anyway said that she wants to go ahead with this child and would like to bring this child up in a family. So we started living together.\n\nAt the time of delivery hospital staff, doctors repeatedly asked for the father of the child and with so much of explaining, and prioritising her mental health, and giving a child a legitimate name, I gave in to have some marriage registered.\n\nShe got hold of her three friends as witness and some priest from her temple to sign the forms and we registered the marriage with local municipality giving some arbitrary date as marriage date. No actually marriage under Hindu customs ever took place.\n\nSo say our daughter was born on 10th, our registration happened on 25th (after she was born), so as we don't face any hassle in giving her legal status.\n\nHowever it turned out that we were just not right for each other. Now few years down the line we have decided to live separately and given how things are this will mainly lead to a divorce.\n\nFor context, we both are working professionals and earn decent livings to provide for our kids and live a good life in a metro. I have more assets than her. \n\nAs long as it is mutual I am all for it, however if she suddenly starts asking for Alimony, by Hindu marriage act she can claim 1/3 of my assets. My lawyer has advised that this may get reduced as I am sole provider to my 2 daughters from my previous marriage, plus looking after my aging parents, so Alimony amount would get reduced substantially if I am able to show genuine liablities.\n\nMy question here is can alimony be nullified if I say we actually never got married under Hindu act, and registered marriage was only done to give me third daughter a legitimate name. Also if you see all witnesses and priest who signed the document were all from her side, which shows this was done under some duress that time.  \nI am ready to take 100% care of all my daughters.\n\nPlease advice.\n\n",

They showed us flats and quoted high prices, demanding brokerage fees. We found a better deal through another broker and paid them instead. This upset the maintenance staff, who felt they'd lost out on the brokerage. Throughout the year, they made life difficult for us.\n\nRecently, our lease ended, and three of my flatmates left. My friend and I wanted to stay, so we asked the owner if we could find new flatmates. She agreed, but the maintenance staff intervened, claiming \"replacements are not allowed\" and that \"co-living\" is not permitted. Their reason is that one of the original flatmates was my friend's sister, and now that she's left, they're citing this as an issue.\n\nHowever, our parents have no problem with our living arrangement, and the owner is also okay with it. In fact, our parents have visited us multiple times without any issues. It's clear that the maintenance staff is selectively targeting us, as there are other bachelors co-living in the society who came through them.\n\nWhen potential new flatmates came to visit, security stopped them, citing ridiculous reasons. We questioned the security, hurting their egos. Now, they're not allowing anyone to visit our flat, including friends and colleagues. They're making up excuses to target us. Even the owner's intervention hasn't helped.\n\nHas anyone else faced similar issues? What legal recourse do we have against the housing society? Any advice would be appreciated.",

        "text": "I live in a housing society in Hyderabad, and I'm seeking legal advice on how to deal with the harassment we're facing from the maintenance staff.\n\nWhen we first moved in, we dealt with two ladies from the maintenance staff. They showed us flats and quoted high prices, demanding brokerage fees. We found a better deal through another broker and paid them instead. This upset the maintenance staff, who felt they'd lost out on the brokerage. Throughout the year, they made life difficult for us.\n\nRecently, our lease ended, and three of my flatmates left. My friend and I wanted to stay, so we asked the owner if we could find new flatmates. She agreed, but the maintenance staff intervened, claiming \"replacements are not allowed\" and that \"co-living\" is not permitted. Their reason is that one of the original flatmates was my friend's sister, and now that she's left, they're citing this as an issue.\n\nHowever, our parents have no problem with our living arrangement, and the owner is also okay with it. In fact, our parents have visited us multiple times without any issues. It's clear that the maintenance staff is selectively targeting us, as there are other bachelors co-living in the society who came through them.\n\nWhen potential new flatmates came to visit, security stopped them, citing ridiculous reasons. We questioned the security, hurting their egos. Now, they're not allowing anyone to visit our flat, including friends and colleagues. They're making up excuses to target us. Even the owner's intervention hasn't helped.\n\nHas anyone else faced similar issues? What legal recourse do we have against the housing society? Any advice would be appreciated.",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I need legal advice regarding a **sports injury** that happened on my **first day** at a badminton academy.\n\nI had enrolled in a **3-month training program** and paid the full fee in advance. However, on **Day 1**, I suffered a **serious injury (Grade 3 ankle sprain -complete rapture of legament & hairline fracture)** while playing. The issue is not just the injury but **how the academy handled it:**\n\n1. The **coach saw me fall but did not assist or offer any medical help. Instead asked me to move out of the court and asked me to go home and sleep and by morning it would be good.** \n2. When I went to the **academy office for first aid**, they **had no ice pack or spray (Move spray was out of stock).**\n3. I had to **go home on my own, without any help or medical attention.**\n4. Later, when I visited a doctor, I was diagnosed with a **Grade 3 ankle sprain and a hairline fracture**.\n5. I reached out to the academy for a **refund**, but they said they have a **\"No Refund in Any Circumstances\" policy** (this is written on the bill/receipt).\n6. The **person I spoke to refused to give me phone number, name etc of the owner**\n\nI feel this is **clear negligence** on their part since they **failed to provide basic medical assistance** to an injured player.\n\n# My Questions:\n\n1. Can I **file an FIR** under **IPC Sections 336, 337, and 338** (negligence causing harm)?\n2. Can I **file a case in Consumer Court** under the **Consumer Protection Act, 2019**, for **\"deficiency in service\"** and demand a refund + medical expenses?\n3. Since their **No Refund policy** is written on the receipt, will that prevent me from getting a refund legally?\n4. If I **post my experience on social media** (Google reviews, Justdial, etc.), will that help put pressure on them?\n5. Any other legal options I should consider?\n\nWould really appreciate any expert opinions or experiences from people who have dealt with similar cases.\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "text": "\n\nIt has been 120 days since I was suspended. 120 days of 95% radio silence. No clarity, no communication—just a career put on indefinite hold because a major Indian airline decided to punish me for replying to a colleague’s WhatsApp message.\n\nI have not leaked confidential information. I have not insulted the company. I have not done anything that puts their name in jeopardy. But I have been banned from the airport, not allowed to return to my hometown, and left in professional limbo—all because I dared to have a conversation.\n\nHow It Started:\n\nThe real issue? I raised concerns about the company’s room-sharing policy.\n\nFor those who don’t know, the airline forces cabin crew to share hotel rooms during layovers. It doesn’t take a genius to see why this is a terrible idea. There have been cases of theft, harassment, and even smuggling linked to this practice. Every crew member knows the risks, but the management refuses to acknowledge them.\n\nI used official channels to report my concerns. No response. I tried again. Still nothing. The system is designed to ignore complaints so that the airline never has to take responsibility.\n\nSo, when I discussed the issue in a private WhatsApp group with colleagues, I wasn’t doing anything radical—I was just looking for support from people who understood. And that’s when they decided to come after me.\n\nThe “Charges” Against Me:\n\n\t1.\tNot maintaining “high standards” of work ethic and conduct.\n\t•\tBecause questioning an unsafe policy is apparently unprofessional.\n\t2.\tNot adhering to company policies and SOPs.\n\t•\tEven though nothing I did violated any actual policy.\n\t3.\tCommitting acts “prejudicial” to the company’s interests.\n\t•\tIf pointing out safety risks is against the company’s interests, what does that say about them?\n\t4.\tInsubordination, inciting disruption, breaching law.\n\t•\tTheir biggest lie—that I organized a “mass sick leave” protest. Reality? I actively discouraged it. But they twisted my words, removed the context, and turned it into an excuse to get rid of me.\n\nThe “Inquiry”—If You Can Even Call It That:\n\n\t•\tCross-examination? Denied. Because why allow fairness when you can just declare someone guilty?\n\t•\tEvidence? Out of context, manipulated, misinterpreted.\n\t•\tKey questions? Ignored. Because the answers wouldn’t fit their narrative.\n\t•\tUnderstanding how WhatsApp works? Nonexistent. The inquiry officer thought a pinned message was a “heading” and used it as proof of my intent. This is the level of “expertise” deciding my career.\n\t•\tCode of Conduct? Only enforced when it suits them. The same principles they preach about fairness, transparency, and protection from retaliation? Completely ignored when it’s inconvenient for them.\n\nThe Reality:\n\nI have not leaked anything. I have not defamed the company. I have not done anything illegal. Yet I’ve been treated like a criminal—stuck in a city I don’t belong to, unable to return home, banned from my workplace, and left in a void of silence.\n\n120 days. No proper explanation. No fair trial. No closure. Just silence.\n\nThis isn’t about policy violations. This isn’t about misconduct. This is about a company using its power to silence employees who dare to question its flawed systems.\n\nThey are dragging this out, knowing the financial and mental toll it takes. They are waiting for me to break, to give up, to disappear quietly. But I refuse.\n\nIf this is how they treat someone who simply spoke up about safety, imagine what else they’re hiding.",

The other car hit us forcefully, and we noticed the driver was on his phone at the time.\n\nWe have recordings from the scene showing the damage. Our car sustained only minor damage, with some scratches and a damaged light. The other driver gave us his phone number and mentioned he owns a workshop where he could repair the damage or he agreed to cover the damages and share the bill with him. Since I had a flight to catch, we agreed to this arrangement.\n\nHowever, after the accident, when we tried to contact him, he claimed he was on the way somewhere and promised to send the workshop details via WhatsApp. After that, he stopped responding entirely. Using his number, we managed to find his workshop location and Instagram account and page for business. We kept trying to reach him, but whenever he picked up, he stayed silent. We ended up fixing the light issue at a nearby workshop for just ₹1500, leaving only a small dent and some scratches on the car.\n\nNow, we're unsure what steps to take next.

        "text": "Hey everyone, I hope you’re doing well.\n\nWe are in a very difficult and unimaginable situation right now. A couple of days ago, my father sold a property and received 50% of the payment in cash and 50% via cheque. My father owns an office, and he believed he had stored the 50% cash in his locker while handing over the cheque to my brother.\n\nDue to some past issues between my father and my brother, my brother went to the office, opened the locker, and took the entire 50% cash—essentially half of my father’s life savings. On top of that, the cheque has also been submitted to the bank and is expected to be deposited by Monday.\n\nThis means my father’s entire life savings are now in my brother’s possession. What makes matters worse is that my brother has now left, and we have no idea where he is. He called some relatives and informed them that he no longer wants any connection with us.\n\nWe are at a complete loss as to what to do. Relatives are advising us to file an FIR, but this is an extremely emotional and difficult decision. Should we proceed with it, or is there another solution we haven’t considered?\n\nOur biggest concern right now is the cheque. Since the account is in my brother’s name, once the money is deposited, we might not be able to recover it. However, we never expected something like this to happen, which is why we trusted him with the cheque.\n\nIs there any way to stop the cheque from being deposited before Monday? If it does get deposited, even though the account is under his name, is there a legal way to prove that he had no right to take the money?\n\nWe also have CCTV footage of him entering the office, opening the safe, and taking all the money. Could this help in any way?\n\nAny guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. We are trying everything we can but are completely lost at this point.\n\nThank you for your help.",

        "text": "Context about my Uncle:\nMy maternal uncle has long-standing mental health issues—hallucinations, paranoia, and talking to himself—but he refuses treatment and has never been officially diagnosed. Outwardly, he appears independent, managing daily life, but those who spend time with him quickly notice something is amiss.  \n\nHis mistrust in family stems from an incident decades ago when my grandfather attempted to admit him for treatment by spiking his drink. Since then, he has been deeply suspicious. But he was always unemployed and was dependent on my granddad. So While my grandmother was alive, things remained stable. After her passing, he inherited a significant sum, moved out and distanced himself. \n\nMy granddad died of cancer. Even days before passing way he wanted my uncle to be happy and called him to write his will but he never cooperated. After my grandfather's death, we got to know my uncle had hired a lawyer with a notorious reputation( even before my grandad passed away). Despite knowing the proposal from his lawyer was unreasonable, we agreed to it. However, a day before signing, my uncle insisted on drilling a borewell on the partitioned land. To avoid disputes, we asked him to wait until after the partition, which led to a heated argument. His lawyer then called off the deal, followed by false cases against us (all dismissed). Since then, my uncle has refused any communication, and all attempts at reconciliation have failed.\n\nWe had filed a partition suit and his lawyer did not make a single proposal on how he wants this to be split. Despite us letting him know we are ready to settle in any way that they want and to pay him some amount for him to drop it. It felt like he wanted the case to be dragged.\n\nProblem:\nWe got to know recently that despite barely spending anything, my uncle is nearly depleted and we he is selling another property and the lawyer is facilitating it. The man has barely 3 bulbs and a fan and lives In a farmshed which is barely 200sqft. He doesn't own any appliances, vehicles or has any other expenses, doesn't eat fancy or buy fancy. For him to burn through his money raises a lot of suspicion on him being exploited.\n\nThe partition suit is now in its final stages after years of unnecessary delays. My uncle remains isolated, deeply trusts this lawyer (who suspiciously doesn’t charge him as per him), and rumors suggest he may have been unknowingly married on paper to exploit him (tbh sounded far-fetched to me dont know the truth here). While he has no spouse or heirs, we want to ensure his assets are protected from external exploitation.  \n\nAnd the funny part is we are on good terms with him on all matters expect his lawyer. We have attempted to warn him multiple times.\n\nSince he has no official diagnosis, courts recognize him as fully independent, making legal intervention nearly impossible. Are there any legal avenues to challenge this situation? Could undue influence or financial exploitation be grounds for action?  \n\nWe’ve prioritized our mental well-being, but watching this unfold is frustrating. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

My payment was due in Sep 24 and since then he has paid 15 lakhs so far after chasing him multiple times. He is communicating with properly, and has shown all the intentions to pay the money back. However, he has failed to meet his commitments many times. My assumption is that he is trying to manage multiple creditors and does not have enough liquid money. He assured me that he has a few properties with his partner and they are trying to liquidate those properties to pay off his debt.\n\nI dont have any documentation, plus I paid him cash.  Yes, ai was stupid but he is my childhood friend and I trusted him. \n\nI am scared that he might not be able to repay anything more to me or deprioritize me against other investors. He and his father (who is the main director of the business) are willing to sign any documents, etc. \n\nWhat documents should I get them to sign and how can I protect myself as much as I can so that I build leverage against him and if god forbid, it comes to the complete non-payment, then I can build a solid case against him and his father.\n\nFurther, what other approaches can I apply in this case?

Here’s a summary:\n\nBackground: My sibling (S) and cousin (C) have been manipulating and emotionally abusing me since childhood. This started when I was around 8-9 years old and has continued to this day.\nSibling’s Behavior: S has always been jealous and manipulative. She would use information I shared with her to manipulate me and others. She would play mind games, blame me for her actions, and turn family and friends against me.\nCousin’s Involvement: C lived with us due to her parents' circumstances. Initially, we were close, but S manipulated C into participating in her games. They would ignore me, provoke me, and turn others against me.\nEscalation: When I was 15, an incident occurred where C made sexual advances towards me. This led to a complex and confusing situation where we both engaged in inappropriate behavior. Later, I believe they used this incident to accuse me of sexual assault, turning the family against me.\nCurrent Situation: I am now isolated, facing psychological torture, and unable to progress in life due to their constant interference. They have spread false accusations, leading to social and familial ostracization.\n\nLegal Questions:\nWhat legal actions can I take against S and C for defamation and emotional abuse?\nHow can I prove their manipulation and false accusations in a legal setting?\nWhat steps can I take to protect myself legally and emotionally from their ongoing harassment?\nAre there any legal resources or organizations that can help me navigate this situation?\nI appreciate any legal advice or guidance on how to address this issue.

She is very disciplined and does well in her studies.\n\nInitially, she used to complain that her teacher would get angry for no reason and yell at every child in the class. One day, when I went to pick her up, I saw her teacher yelling at one of the kids. I immediately reported this to the school. That same day, I received a call from the coordinator. I told her that I would not send my daughter to school until her class was changed or the teacher was removed. She asked me to come to the school to meet her in person.\n\nWhen I went to the school, she assured me that she would address the issue but also blamed it on the fact that my daughter was still adjusting to the Indian system. She also mentioned that the teacher had been with the school for many years.\n\nFor the next few weeks, everything seemed fine, but then we started noticing behavioral changes in our daughter. She began saying sorry even when she hadn’t done anything wrong. She got scared if her nails weren’t trimmed. She became excessively anxious about completing her homework. When she fell sick, she worried that missing school would make her teacher angry.\n\nWhen my wife tried to discuss these concerns with the teacher, she dismissed them, saying that we were worrying too much and that schools in India function differently from those in the US.\n\nI feel I should do something about this school. I think others simply take their kids to different schools. But ideally this school should be penalised for harassing students. \n\nAny advice?",

Here's the full picture:\n\n* **Exam Schedule & Delayed Internship Application:** We had theory exams right up until January 30th, meaning we couldn't apply for internships before this date.\n* **College's Very Short Holiday:** My college only gave us a very short holiday from February 1st to 17th. This is crucial because internships are usually longer than just a few weeks.\n* **Delayed Internship Approval (Company & College):** I applied for an internship, but both the company's approval process and the college's internal approval took a significant amount of time.\n* **Internship Start Date (After Holidays):** The internship was finally approved with a start date of February 19th to March 21st – after the very short college holiday ended. This is a 30-day internship.\n* **HOD's Refusal & Unrealistic Suggestion:** Despite the internship starting after the holiday period and being a standard 30-day duration, the Head of Department (HOD) is refusing permission. They are saying no special permission will be given, and incredibly, suggested I attend the internship after college hours.\n* **Impossible Commute:** My commute to the internship office is approximately 3 hours each way. This makes the HOD's suggestion completely unrealistic and practically impossible. It's also not an online internship.\n* **Core Problem:** The college gave a holiday that was far too short to accommodate a proper internship, and now the HOD is blocking me with an unworkable suggestion. This feels incredibly unfair, especially since the delays in approval weren't my fault.\n* **Seeking Urgent Advice:** What can I possibly do? Who can I appeal to? This internship is really important for my career, and the HOD's stance seems completely unreasonable given the circumstances. Any suggestions on how to get permission would be greatly appreciated!\"",

Despite knowing little about Suraj—aside from having seen him around for years—we thought it was a good opportunity.\n\nWe ended up paying a total of 15 lakhs as an initial payment on a 40 lakh deal:\n\n* **5 lakhs** via direct bank transfer\n* **10 lakhs** withdrawn from the bank and given to him\n\nLater, we learned that the shop was actually with the bank and was about to be seized. When we confronted Suraj, he claimed that the money was meant to retrieve the shop from the bank. But soon after, the bank sold the property to someone else via auction.\n\nNow, after 10 months, Suraj has only returned **7 lakhs**. Initially, he promised to pay back **2 lakhs per month** and even gave us a bearer cheque (with no date) stating he’d call us when we could deposit it. This worked for about a month, then he switched to making online transfers—**1 lakh** for some months, then **50 thousand,** and for the past two months, nothing at all. Saying he doesn't have money now, he stays in a flat near us.\n\nWe’ve consulted one lawyer who suggested sending him a notice, though I’m skeptical it will make a real impact. As I’ve often read here that lawyers, in many cases, just try to stretch things out to fill their pockets and keep the process going for as long as possible with no output. My dad’s friend (who originally urged the deal) has now backed out, saying he tried his best but couldn’t help.\n\nWe do have 4 cheques of 2 lakhs for the remaining amount and a handwritten, signed letter from Suraj acknowledging receipt of the money.\n\nHas anyone been through something similar or have any practical advice on legal steps, negotiation tactics, or any other avenues we might pursue? Any suggestions or shared experiences would be incredibly helpful.\n\nThanks in advance for taking a couple of minutes to help out!",

We have 2 kids also 6 y o and 2 y o. My parents live abroad while I lived with husband and his family in india. My parents told my maternal uncle about this and he had told me to let him know if i needed help. \n\nIn Nov 2023, my husband and I and kids went to a family wedding and my uncle was there. He took my husband aside and scolded him and told him he should be good and stop drinking or else my uncle will help me get away from him. My husband was deeply offended that my uncle scolded him and when we came back from the wedding, his abuse and torture escalated. I immediately called my parents and they flew down to india, and along with my uncle and another uncle who is a lawyer, they brought the police. I wrote a police complaint (not FIR, only written complaint as a letter) and left with my parents, along with my kids in early December 2023.\n\nI went with my parents to the country where they live, and i was fully transparent to my husband and his family about where we are. They do video calls with children at least 5 days in a week. Husband knows our address and has ordered cake and toys for the children a few times in the last year. Just to add, he has not sent any money or anything like that since we left and i have not asked either. I started working again (i had stopped before marriage) and i am sending my kid to school and managing other expenses with my parents help. My parents don't live in a western country where it is difficult to get visa or where flights are expensive. Visa is on-arrival for $50 and there is a direct flight from mumbai. My husband and inlaws are upper middle class and well able to afford it. I have invited them all to come and visit the children whenever they want. I don't want anything to do with them but I have no intention of keeping the kids from them.\n\nEvery other week, my husband sends random ranting messages to me insulting me and my family members and friends. Recently he started messaging disgusting things directly to my family and friends too. They all sent me screenshots and i told them to ignore and block him. Only i have not blocked his number for the sake of the kids. Last night he sent a message to me that my uncle tried to r*pe his sister two years ago when we had gone to my parents' hometown (in india) for my 2nd delivery. He has been angry at my uncle because of his scolding, and every now and then he calls him derogatory names, but this is going too far. His sister is a 42 years old and unmarried but in a good job and a smart woman. I sent her his message screenshots and she said 'so sorry, i will scold him'. He obviously sent this without her knowledge. It's bad enough he is defaming my uncle, but also his sister? \n\nAnyway, i guess her scolding also hasn't helped because he is continuing to say the same thing about my uncle, and also saying my uncle might have tried to do the same to his own daughters (he has 2 daughters). I have ignored all of his other disgusting rantings (he called my father a chakka, and my sister a prostitute for working night shift - she is an emergency doctor), but this is really unbearable for me. \n\nCan I file a defamation case just from his text messages?

        "text": "I recently found a 9-year-old resale flat in Bengaluru on NoBroker. The seller had opted for NoBroker’s postpaid service, meaning I couldn’t access his contact details or property documents until I paid a **₹2L token advance**. The email I received from NoBroker clearly stated:\n\n*\"In the event of any issues with property documents, legal concerns, or loan issues that prevent registration, the paid amount will be fully refunded without any deductions.\"*\n\nAfter negotiating through NoBroker’s Relationship Manager (RM), I brought the price down from **₹95L to ₹85L** and agreed to proceed. On **Jan 30**, I paid **₹2L** via NoBroker’s payment link (confirmed in my bank statement). The seller received **₹1.4L**, and NoBroker took a **₹60K commission** (confirmed by Seller). NoBroker sent me a receipt as well two days later.\n\nOnce I got the property documents, my lawyer found that the building **does not have an Occupancy Certificate (OC)** since it was built before RERA and falls under BMRDA. My lawyer even asked for a **Completion Certificate (CC)** as an alternative, but the apartment association didn't have it**.** This was a dealbreaker for me, as OC/CC absence impacts resale value and could create legal/loan issues. After some discussion, the seller agreed to my decision to back out.\n\nOn Feb 19, I emailed NoBroker requesting a refund as per their policy, citing the **lack of OC/CC as a legal concern**, and even submitted my lawyer’s **Title Search Report**. NoBroker has not responded to my emails for **three days** and, over a phone call, denied the refund, saying *OC is not a legal requirement for registration, so backing out is my personal choice*. The RM even **lied**, claiming the full ₹2L went to the seller (I confirmed from bank statements that it passed through NoBroker).\n\nThe **seller is refusing to return the ₹1.4L**, saying he lost a prior deal at **₹80L** because NoBroker convinced him to accept my **₹85L offer**. He paid **₹1.6L** brokerage to another agent, so he considers my ₹1.4L as *compensation for his losses*.\n\n# Legal Questions:\n\n1.  Is NoBroker legally obligated to refund me based on their email? Was it even legal to charge ₹2L just to provide seller details & documents?  \n2. Can **OC absence be considered a legal concern** that prevents registration?  \n3. If NoBroker refuses to refund, **can I take legal action**? Under what charges?  \n4. Can I **file a case against the seller** since he received my ₹1.4L via NoBroker and is now refusing to return it?\n\nWould appreciate any legal insights! Happy to answer any questions.\n\nPS: Using a throwaway account to post this.",

However, my brother firmly told her that it wouldn’t be the right decision and that they couldn't move forward. It took her some time to accept the rejection, but eventually, she did.\n\nThe issue now is with her father. He hasn’t stopped calling my dad since they got the news.

They built a temporary house (kachha makan) on their plot and we built permanent house parallel to their house. At this point there were no other houses in the vicinity, just two of us.\nAfter some years, we got to know that our houses are crooked and went into neighbours plot. So, most of the part of our house went into the person X plot and person X house went into person Y plot.\nThen my father and person X went to person Y in order to buy their plot and end this dispute. Person Y kept neglecting and delaying to sell. Later after some years, person X built somewhat better house at the same place. Later on we also extended one room on our plot. Till this point person X and us were on the same page to buy person Y plot and end the dispute.\nBefore a couple of years, person X came to us and asked to go to person Y to buy their plot since person X wanted to build permanent house. So, we went to person Y and multiple rounds of discussions. In the end person Y agreed to sell it at somewhat lower rates than the market. Person X then backed off from buying saying I’ll build my house at the current location only. (Earlier it was decided that person X will buy some part and we will buy the other part) So, we bought the entire plot.\nBefore a month of so, person X demolished their existing house, came to us and asked now I want to build my house what do I do. We said you only wanted to build at the current location so build there. So he agreed, but after a few days again came to us that I want undisputed land and all. So, we asked him to shift to the edge of person Y plot which we bought plus we came to an agreement that we will also give 55k as compensation (this compensation makes no sense in my view but they constantly blames us that we built the house and so they have to do adjustments, so my father said let’s end this by giving them some compensation) they agreed to this. But that requires sub division, to move out 1020 sq ft plot out from 2000sq ft. Later on they backed off from this also saying we won’t shift to that place giving ridiculous reasons.\n\n\nTo summarise, we are agreed to person X’s demands still they are not satisfied with anything, we agreed to give them same plot adjacent to their current plot which won’t have any dispute additionally agreed to give compensation as well. Still giving ridiculous reasons they are backing off.\n\nWhat legal actions can they take given our house is there on their plot since 25+ years, they also had their house in some other land but they demolished inorder to build a new one, so they conveniently demanding anything they want? If they go to court what could be the verdict?\nWhat legal actions can we take on this?\nAny legal advices to us?",

        "text": "I was looking for a good gym to join in Gurgaon. The closest one was Gold's Gym listed on the Cult Fit mobile app. It had no photos/videos, and no free trial slots available either, so I checked with the support team to see if the space is even functional. They confirmed it is, and asked me to visit the gym and ask the trainer to have a look around. Did just that, only to find that no such gym exists at the location tagged on their app. Asked around in the area, thinking maybe the marked the wrong location, but no one had heard of any gym in this locality. I was surprised because this had the classification of a 'luxury' gym and the subscription package was different than the others (more expensive). And this was the \\*only\\* gym of this category in Gurgaon (acc. to their own classification system), meaning if someone did end up buying the package, they wouldn't be able to access the thing they paid extra money for.\n\nI contacted the support team and they have since removed this listing from their app but for quite some time, it had an active payment page, meaning anyone could have purchased it.\n\nMy question is: Is this considered fraud or intention to fraud under Indian law and can any legal action be taken against them?",

        "text": "\nHi all \n\nI’m writing on behalf of my sister who is facing this dilemma (with everyone’s “obvious” choices making decision-making hard). I’m hoping I can get some help from this community here for the same. \n\nQualifications: NLIU Bhopal third year student. \n\nShe has represented her college at many regional moots and has now got the opportunity to attend the Oxford moot. Their team qualified for the international round but it clashes with their end-term exam dates. She has been getting first rank in every semester so far (with a good margin between her and second place holder) and is on track to be the 5 year aggregate topper. The problem now is that if she attends this moot, she will be giving her exams with the retests of next semester (“deemed first attempt” it will be called) but that will rule out her eligibility for the gold medal for the no. 1 rank holder. \n\nShe has been talking to seniors, some alumni, mentor-like figures but I’m hoping this community will help us get a wider reach with academics too. Personally I feel she should attend the moot as it would be a great opportunity for the exposure, the networking and experience it offers , but it is not my decision. \n\nSo my ask is to get your opinions on these few considerations:\n\n1. Assuming she remains the aggregate topper at the end of her course, how much difference does it make if she is the no. 1 rank holder but without a gold medal?\n\n2. How much value would you put on an international moot like at Oxford? \n\n3. Considering she would pursue higher education after her NLIU course, \n\n   (a) if immediately after NLIU, she would be sending applications in her 5th year. She would have had no medal confirmation yet. How much would a gold medal matter then in her future endeavours? \n\n    (b) if after few years of work, how much weight given to gold medal / batch topper achievement, vs her work experience? \n\nI feel like there’s a lot of things that might be obvious to the community or considerations that you might not even think important. But my sister has been scratching her head over this for a few weeks now and the time to make a decision is approaching fast. Any input here will be very very appreciated. \n\nThank you. ",

They implied something along the lines of, if he passes then I would be held responsible in some way. I then pleaded that I was a student in a PG and couldn't do that much. That I just saw someone that needed help and informed 112. After pleading for some minutes, they let me go. This whole incident made me feel unsafe for just being a responsible person. The whole time I was also on the phone with an ambulance.\n\nI feel many people don't do the right thing because they are scared of facing this interaction.(At least a 100 people would have walked past this guy. This happened in a very crowded place) I don't want to be scared the next time that I report some incident like this.\n\n(I read about some Good Samaritan Rules on the internet, but I am not a lawyer, and would like some clarity on how to handle this type of situation and my rights, that's why I am asking this question)",

However during the FY24-25 due to changes in my personal life and where my org's vision is heading, my performance has been less than mediocre. Due to cost cutting and other reasons, this year my org is planning to shed 50% of their capacity by putting more people on a performance plan, tightening the rules and not giving any pay hikes.\n\nSadly, I'm one of those who is on a performance plan right now. While my manager is supportive and is willing to bring me out of it, I see no future with this org and I decided to not fight it, take the lumpsum and leave. According to the current HR and Legal guidelines, if I leave under a performance plan, I'm eligible for (1) Gratuity bonus for my tenure (2) Leaves encashment (3) Salary compensation for me to sustain before I find another job.\n\nWhile the company cannot touch or modify 1 & 2, I'm hearing rumours that 3 will be completely eliminated due to cost cutting in my org. Based on the current policies in my company I see that the compensation is a calculation based on my tenurity and previous performances, but it's not clear how much or how it's calculated. I've talked to people with similar tenure who left on a performance plan in the previous years and they say that I'm eligible for 7-8 month pay as compensation. \n\nIf my org decides to give me the stick and not give me #3 at all, I'd like to know if I can proceed legally to get some pay. I have screenshots I captured yesterday of the policy which states I'm eligible for a compensation based on my tenurity and previous performances (with the date on when I took the screenshot).\n\nIf proceeding legally will not bare any fruits, I'd rather resign, get 1 & 2 and keep my re-hire status as \"yes\" because if they fire me my re-hire status would be \"no\" for the next 5 years. \n\nI'd appreciate any help in this matter.

The founder initially reassured employees not to leave, stating that the acquisition would be beneficial for everyone.\n\nHowever, today, she and all her colleagues received a sudden meeting invite. She later found out that in this meeting, the founder told them they could resign today and would be offered jobs in another company. This sounds very shady, and she’s unsure about her rights in this situation.\n\nShe has a call scheduled at 8:00 PM today regarding this. Given the circumstances, does she have any legal entitlement to severance pay? Is this a forced resignation, and if so, how should she approach it?\n\nWould appreciate any guidance from those who have dealt with similar situations or understand labor laws.",

        "text": "Hello everyone. I'm a 24F working in Blr. Recently I was on a hunt for a good separate room in a big apartment w flatmates for myself. I checked out this place few days ago and absolutely LOVED it. Although it was a little over my budget, I still went ahead. I spoke to the flatmates for almost 2 hours and didn't find any red flags and thought everything is as per my needs. \n\nI even put down a token amount of 25k before leaving the apartment when I went to visit. But the next day I did some math and realised that paying deposit, maintenance, rent and the setup cost for the apartment was too big of an amount (1.2 lakhs total upfront) for me to put upfront and that it is not a wise financial decision  to lock a big amount like that. \n\nSo I called the owner the next day to tell him I'm no longer interested and that he should refund my token amount. And he refused saying tokens are non refundable and that I should find a replacement and he would consider the token paid. \n\nHis property manager forwarded me this message earlier today\n\n\"The token is always non refundable as was conveyed to her prior transaction. The decision on her part was made after thought. \n\nA relatively big amount was quoted so that we don't entertain non-serious prospects and avoid situations exactly like this one.\nWe declined other people because of her and we face the loss due to her careless and hurried decision. She was not forced to put down the token, she did so as a functioning adult capable of taking decisions. \n\nIf decisions like this could be flipped, then what purpose would token amounts serve? It would be useless to collect tokens.\n\nThere are only two things we can do for her here:\n1. If she is able to find someone to take her spot from March 1st, we can accept and consider the entire token amount to be given to us by the replacement.\n2. We can refund 20k to her from our end if and only if we are able to find a replacement by March 1st. The 5k will be withheld as penalty charges for our losses.\n3. If we are unable to find a replacement by March 1st, the 25k is forfeited.\n\nHer unprofessional behaviour has cost us convertible leads. And hence there must be compensation for the same. \n\nIncase she disagrees to this arrangement, clarify to her that this is a civil matter not a cybercrime matter and that she should file it in the civil court. She will hear from my lawyer if and after she chooses to do so.\"\n\n25k token amount is big amount for me and cannot afford to lose it. What should I do? Any advice and help is highly appreciated.\n\nThanks",

        "text": "Hi all.\n\n\n\nSo my friend (primary guarantor) approached me in Nov 2022 to become a secondary guarantor for a secured business loan of 1.6 Cr (8 years tenure) for his father (borrower). Having worked with their business in 2019, I obliged to help since their business was working okayish and they were expanding. They also bought new machineries. Although that big amount scared me but my friend assured me that there is \"no need to worry\" and this is \"just for formality\". And they have a good relationship with their bank (co-operative bank) since many years. So I signed all the relevant documents in good faith and \"to help\". Yes, looking back, I was naive.\n\n\n\nAnd then I go about living my life and forget about it. They did not tell me whether the loan started and even I didn't inquire. They didn't give me any sanction letter as well. Note: I didn't have much salary in 2022 and 0 credit history (genuine question, why and how does a bank even approve such cases where guarantor is \"poor\", have no assets or personal wealth which can reimburse such a huge amount)\n\n\n\nUnaware, loan commences from Jan 2023. My friend and I don't talk since May 2023 due to some other personal issue. However there is no problem with his father.\n\n\n\nEverything is good until Jan 2024, I apply for a home loan and my bank tells me that I can't get a loan since I'm a guarantor in a business loan and it has irregular payments and a SUB (substandard) state.\n\n\n\nI call them and ask for a reason for the irregular payments. His father tells me the business is not working well and he is in talks with other nationalised banks for takeover (transfer loan to other bank) and for CC limit with current bank. I call his father back after a month. He says to call back in March since he is still in talks. I am furious at this point and since I don't have any control and feel that since he's been a businessman for soooo long and his relationship with bank is good, he will figure something out. I decide to wait more and give him time. I call back in May. Same response. I call him back in July, same response. He asks me to call back in Sep, I wait and decide to call him in Nov instead. He asks me to call back in Dec end. \n\n\n\nAt this point, full year's payments have been missed. I get a notice from bank in Dec beginning that loan has NPA'd in Aug 2024. I also get to know that there is another loan of 1.4 Cr signed by other guarantor. I also get a call from random bank asking me if I can contact my friend since he's missed the EMIs for his car (\\~40 lakhs) although I am not a guarantor in that (I checked the CIBIL reports myself).\n\n\n\nI decide to give his father a break and another benefit of doubt that he might be sorting this out. So I call him 2 months later, ie this month, Feb. He says he's still working on the takeover to nationalised bank.\n\n\n\nBut my patience is over. They are \"good\" people (I have seen them invest in good machineries for which they look loans and are expanding the business), but it seems to me that they have taken advantage of me and other to get loan approval (since a secondary guarantor could have been his wife as well or some other family member). I know they are more in agony than me which is why I decided to be calm about this, but like I said my patience is over now. A random google search also told me my friend, this time, has borrowed 9L for his own company and her mother as a guarantor and even that has NPA'd in Nov 2024.\n\n\n\nI know I am late but hopefully not too late asking for help. I know guarantor cannot be changed unless there is takeover. But I doubt nationalised bank is going to approve this because if it did, this would have been over already.\n\n\n\nSo what legal steps can I take to safeguard myself from bank screwing me over? ",

        "text": "I’m caught in the dreaded 90-day notice period at Accenture (India) and I’ve cooked up a two-step strategy to try and break free early. I’m curious if anyone’s been there, done that, or thinks I’m just dreaming.\n\nStep 1: The Medical Excuse Gambit\n\nI plan to visit a doctor and get a certificate citing stress-induced insomnia and anxiety. You know, the usual symptoms—racing thoughts, sleepless nights, constant fatigue, maybe even a few dizzy spells. The idea is to have a legit note that recommends immediate rest (and by extension, early release from the notice period). It’s a subjective diagnosis, so hopefully, it’s hard to argue with.\n\nStep 2: The Labour Law Drop\n\nIf HR resists my early exit request, I’ll gently remind them that Indian labour laws require notice periods to be “reasonable” and not create undue hardship. I’m not going full threat mode, just casually mentioning that I might have to consult the Labour Commissioner if things get too sticky. The hope is that this little legal nudge will push them to approve an early release rather than risk a bureaucratic headache.\n\nMy Burning Questions:\n\t1.\tHas anyone successfully shortened their notice period using a medical excuse at an Indian IT firm?\n\t2.\tDo HR folks actually verify a doctor’s note, or is it more of a “trust us” scenario?\n\t3.\tDoes a subtle mention of the Labour Commissioner work as a scare tactic, or is it just empty talk?\n\t4.\tAny other creative, legal loopholes that helped you escape the notice period grind?\n\nDrop your experiences, advice, or even cautionary tales in the comments—I’m eager to hear if this strategy is a genius escape plan or just another wild idea doomed to fail.

I have lost 5k and more importantly time I wasted explaining same thing to various agent again and again who don’t even know how their app works.\n\nI ordered a laptop (Sep 29 2024) from Flipkart along with 3 year complete protection warranty for the laptop. I received defective laptop,\nwhen I tried requesting for refund it was cancelled citing something about seller refusing to refund the amount. I was told\nby Flipkart customer support to contact the brand of laptop for refund. I then contacted Lenovo and received the refund for the\nlaptop. I was also told by Flipkart customer support that once I receive refund from brand then Flipkart will initiate the process\nfor cancelling the 3 year complete warranty. \n\nI was then told by Flipkart to contact Jevees for the refund and they said to contact Flipkart for the same. Now, Flipkart is denying refund for that citing laptop hasn’t been returned via Flipkart.\n\nI filed a company on consumer helpline website this was their response:\n\nHi, Greetings from Flipkart! Order ID: OD432445499764556100 We are sorry for the trouble caused. We certainly understand your concern. We would like to inform you that since the product was delivered on 05 Oct 24, it is post 10 day Return policy. Due to this sorry to inform you that the seller will not be able to initiate the refund request of the product. Hence, closing the complaint from our end as per the policy. Your kind understanding and cooperation are appreciated. Thank you.\n\nThe case has been disposed by consumer complaint this was their response: \n\nThe Company has responded to your grievance. If you are not\nsatisfied with the company\nresponse and want to pursue the\ncase with the company for further\nrelief/ compensation in the\nabsence of suitable/ acceptable\nredressal, you may file a case at the\ndesignated Consumer Commission\nonline. Please visit https://e-\njagriti.gov.in/\n\nLet me know if I can do anything now. Please raise this issue on Twitter because I think this seems very generic and many customers must have faced the same.\n\nThanks for reading!\n",

        "text": "I was working at a small agency back in 2014, where my employer never paid full salary on time and when I stepped down he gave me a post-dated cheque for my pending salary (~₹35,000). The cheque bounced, and I filed a case in Saket Court, Delhi.\n\nThe issue was that the court kept asking for the accused’s address to send a notice, but he had moved from the address I had. I couldn’t find his new address, and after 15 months, my lawyer suggested that my case would be dismissed due to my failure to provide a valid address. I asked him to close the case.\n\nRecently, I came across this person’s LinkedIn profile, where I found the name of the company he has started and his new office address. However, he has a history of frequently changing his office locations, and on LinkedIn, he only mentions working at \"Confidential.\"\n\n\nThe irony? He has started a law firm, despite having no legal background.\n\n\nSince I don’t have any documents with me (they were all in the court records), I want to know:\n\n1. Is there any way to reopen my case and pursue my dues?\n\n\n2. Can I retrieve my case documents from the court?\n\n\n3. What legal options do I have now to take action against him?\n\n\n\nWould appreciate any advice from legal experts!",

        "title": "I think I got myself into a huge financial and legal mess. Please help me urgent.",
        "text": "What happened:\n\nI was added to some whatsapp group which apparently gives stock advice. The moderator introduced themselves as from \"HSBC Securities\". I waited for a few days to see what's happening. There is a moderator called \"Rajiv Jain\" in the group that everyone calls \"Professor\". He tells which stocks to buy and sell. The weird thing is that he advices Upper Circuit stocks and \"Block trades\". If you know anything about stocks, you would know that you can't purchase Upper circuit stocks. And block trades are just direct discount on stocks! He says to buy them and sell next day. All the shares are held 1 day, some special trades two days. They emphasize to sell on time and not hold as it is against rules. This is what they say \"Please buy today and sell after the opening of the next trading day. It is strictly forbidden to expand profits. Once illegal operations are found, they will be blacklisted and all cooperation will be terminated\". So how do you participate in these trades? You need to open a \"Primary Market account\" with them it seems and download their app. \n\nNow I did something really stupid, I know. I went ahead, gave them my PAN card, Aadhaar card and downloaded their app from a direct link (not on playstore). So I transfer them 1.75 Lakh (over days and over multiple transactions). Let me tell you how these transactions worked. You contact Customer support (another whatsapp group). You tell them how much you want to transfer and they tell you which bank account to transfer to. The bank accounts change every time because there is a 100 crore limit on them and they need to change accounts every time it seems. They are never HSBC banks, some small banks accounts.\n\nThe amount is reflected in the app. Let me tell you about the app. It looks like a legit app, you can see the live stock prices (though they seem to update slowly like every 5 mins). When you buy the stocks, even UC, you are immediately granted the stock and sale is also immediate. There is no setting of buy/sell price, always market. For a few days, I followed the trades, made money on the app. The process of withdrawal is to put a withdrawal request and they will either approve/reject it. To test whether withdrawals are working, I withdrew 1000 Rs, it went fine. Few days later, I withdrew 40k, it also worked fine. So my confidence has grown a bit that this might be legit.\n\nNow, here are the reasons why this sounded legit. All the members on the app are always positive, there is never a negative message, everyone is praising, posting screenshots of their trades, of their profits, of how much they deposited. There are a 100 members in the group. I think it is difficult to have this many co conspirators. At least 20 to 30 different people chat in the group actively. But some people were randomly removed from the group too, don't know why. And people were posting screenshots and physical receipts of bank transfers for tens of lakhs of rupees. This moderator Rajiv Jain explained what primary account is, why they are able to get block trades (discounted stock) - as they negotiate with companies - apparently the shareholder are unable to sell on market as that would cause stock crash, so they sell to us at discount it seems (But what was the point if we sell the next day anyway). He also daily explains different concepts and during budget, he gave some insights, so they are at least  very knowledgeable about financials. They also provided a SEBI registration number: INZ000234533. But there were some suspicious things too. Like the discounts are huge. Initially they started at 6%-7%. Later, 10%, 22%, and recently, 33% discount. All big names, ICICI Lombard - 39% discount, ICICI securities - 51% dicount, HDFC - 33% discount. But you need to buy minimum of 10L to 1 crore for some of them. \n\nWhere I got screwed hard: So the third type of trades they do is IPO trading. I was told to apply IPO for Quality Power Electrical Equipment Ltd. Well, I did that. I went to the IPO page, clicked on apply, Weirdly, there is no bidding amount, how many share, nothing. I just got a screen saying submitted. I didn't think much of it. Now 2 days back, I get a message from customer support saying I won the IPO allotment, and I was allotted 2700 shares at 10.8 Lakh rupees. I don't have that much money in that app. I open the app to see my money is zero (All 2 Lakh I had was paid for the IPO it seems). I tell them I can't pay that amount. They reply: \"Hello, according to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) \"Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements (ICDR) Regulations, 2018\", after the IPO allotment is completed, the allotted investors must pay the full amount according to the allocated amount, otherwise they may face risks such as account freezing and future IPO subscription restrictions.\" I had one day to make payment, I obviously didn't do it.\n\nI registered a cyber crime complaint on 1930 (2 days back).. They took details of my transactions. I get this weird message from cyber cell today: \"Dear Sir/ Madam, Status of your Complaint Acknowledgement No. (redacted), dated 19/02/2025, reported on Cyber Crime portal is amount of Rs. 655 has been Put on Hold. Kindly contact your respective Police Station. Regards, National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal.\" What? Why was my money put on hold? I go to police station, they say to get print out of the cyber crime complaint, but I don't see any option to get print out of my submitted complaint. Have to go again tomorrow to resolve.\n\nThings got worse: Tonight, I get this message: Since you have not completed the IPO subscription, in order not to affect the listing of the stock, we have repurchased your account. The repurchase terms are as follows:\n\n1. If you are temporarily unable to pay the IPO subscription funds, HSBC Securities will repurchase\n\n2. Since you violated the regulations, your credit score will drop to 75 points after the repurchase, and it can be restored after completing the repayment\n\n3. If you complete the payment within 5 working days, there will be no additional fees. If it exceeds 5 working days, interest will be adjusted according to the current interest rate\n\nThis is very scary if real. I asked for where are the terms and conditions? They just send me pics of some documents (which look legit) but they refuse to send online link as apparently there is no such link. I ask for speaking to management or asking for office address. They say they do everything online and I can't meet management as it is not feasible.\n\nConclusion I made. This is either a fully scam operation and they are scaring me into sending more money or they are some legitimate financial institution with someone doing illegal activities. If it is the latter - It is really HSBC Securities who are essentially creating false loans with terms and conditions I didn't accept, I think I am royally F\\*\\*\\*ED\n\nI am planning on going to police station again and also go to local HSBC branch to maybe find some answers. If anyone has any advice, please suggest. I know I did stupid things.",

        "text": "Around 4 weeks ago, I found a listing on OLX for a second-hand bike that was priced much lower than usual. When I contacted the seller, he told me the bike had been seized by a bank due to loan non-payment and was being sold cheaply as part of a settlement process (not an auction).\n\nMy dad went to the garage/warehouse of the bank where seized vehicles were kept. Inspected the bike, and it seemed to be in good condition. The seller claimed to be a middleman (between me and the bank. Not a bank employee)  handling the sale. He informed me that this bike came for sale because the initial buyers gave in writing to the bank that they would not be reclaiming the bike. After checking with some people I know, they said this kind of sale does happen, so I proceeded.\n\nWe signed a contract on ₹50 stamp paper with the following terms:\n\n1.\tFor the purpose of buying the bike he/Party A has gotten amount X from me.\n2.\tThe vehicle will be transferred to me within 15 working days.\n3.\tThe vehicle would be in initially said condition and properly working.\n4.\tThe seller is responsible for transferring RTO-related documents to my name.\n5.\tIf these conditions aren’t met, the seller will refund my money.\n\nAlso have a copy of His voters ID\nHad to pay the money upfront because it was using this that he would get it the from bank.\n\nAlthough the contract stated 3 weeks, the seller initially informed me he could complete everything within a week. However, the process kept getting delayed with various excuses—some more convincing than others. After the 15-day period, he asked for 1 more week, promising a refund if he failed to deliver the bike. I agreed.\n\nThe week passed and I gave him a warning, stating that I would take legal action if I didn’t receive the bike or a refund within 2 days. He responded with another voice saying he’ll do it by  over the weekend. I don’t want to keep going back and forth with this.\n\nWhat are my options at this point?\nWould really appreciate any advice on how to proceed. Thanks!\n\nTldr;  Bought a bike from a “dealer” . Involving a contract with refund clause with a 3 week deadline. 1 week after the deadline the dealer now refuses to pick up my calls. With minimal voice note replies. This back and forth is not ending. And would like to know my options.",

        "text": "I’m 24M, and I’m disgusted as I write this. My 12-year-old niece (12F) is in a relationship with a 21-year-old guy (21M), and I feel sick to my stomach. It all started 4-5 months ago when my cousin (her mom) found out that my niece was texting him. He’s the relative of one of her friends. When my cousin found out, she punished her and went to the boy’s house to talk to his parents, explaining that he’s an adult and my niece is just 12. They promised it wouldn’t happen again, and we all thought everything was resolved.\n\nToday, my cousin and her husband visited our home, and I wasn’t fully aware of the situation until now. My cousin shared that she’s still suspicious and caught my niece chatting with him again, this time through a hidden app. I figured out the password for the instagram and went through their messages, and what I saw completely shattered me. The innocent and loving image I had of my niece is gone. They met once in person, and there were explicit photos of them kissing. He’s an addict and a pervert who’s been grooming her, but he manipulated her into sending nudes, sharing porn, and even forcing her and emotionally manipulating her to send him money for alcohol. I literally lost it and vomited after seeing their sexting. As an adult, I would think twice before engaging in something like that, and she’s just 12.\n\nI showed everything to my cousin and her husband, and I strongly urged them to take legal action because she’s a minor about to turn 13, and he’s 21.\n\nI need advice on what we can do to bring this situation back to normal and what legal steps we can take. Any help or guidance would mean a lot right now and also which subs will be helpful if i post it there.\n\nEdit: Not my niece's personal phone she doesnt have one she's using my sister's phone andher grandma's phone. sorry i wrote not solely blamming the boy thinking someone might put blame on us for blamming the boy only as shes also equally involved not in my correct senses since morning.",

Before marriage her name was ‘A B C’ (A is her first name, B is her father’s name, and C is her maiden surname). After marriage her name was changed to ‘A D E F’ (A is her first name, D is her husband’s first given name, E is her husband’s second given name and F is her husband’s surname) and this is the same name in her Aadhaar card as well as her passport.\n\nThe divorce petition that was filed has gone with the name ‘A D F’, so basically her husband’s second given name was not mentioned in the petition. While the petition was being filed in the court lady who was doing the filing raised the concern that her name on the Aadhar Card (‘A D E F’) does not match the name in the divorce petition (‘A D F’) and she also went on to say that the name that will now come in the final decree will be ‘A D F’.\n\nWe are fully paranoid about this incident and don’t know how to proceed. Our lawyer is blaming us for this error and not guiding us on the next steps. Is this mismatch a major issue? Do we need to withdraw the petition and file a new petition again? Does something need to be done right away? Or we can wait until later?\n\nI would really appreciate your advice in this regard. Many thanks in advance for your time and valuable suggestion. In case it helps, the case was filed last week and in Pune Family Court.",

This way, I can live in the same home and have access to both of them. I’m okay with this arrangement, but I do not want to live with my father and his girlfriend.\n\nIs there a legal way to ensure I can stay in my current home with both my parents, at least until I go to college?

        "text": "On Monday: [Writing this with a disturbed mental state. Kindly forgive if any grammatical mistake happens and help me as soon as possible 🙏]\nHello everyone,  currently I'm a b.tech 1st year student. Actually my family is in a weird situation. It's really going to be a long writing so dividing it into the previous context and the main incident, kindly help, as per you knowledge.\n\nPrevious context: My father has one elder brother and one elder sister. So I am now nearly of age 19 and in my childhood partition of our home was done between the two brothers and his elder sister got Rs.50000 instead of plot in home map. After partition my father and his brother got one room each . As he moved out we had to bought his portion ( rather not as per our wish but forcefully) but no big problem with him after that. Grandfather took one room in the ground floor and he lives with us. My grandmother went to live with his elder son and it was all decided by my grandparents and their elder son only. Now if we talk about the family relations then actually my mother is from a poor household.  Her father expired during her board exams. Her mother did each and everything to raise and educate her well. Before they got married my mother went to do a typewriting type of work to a commercial complex , although today she is a state government school clerk.  In that complex my father also runs a business.  An advocate lady actually arranged their marriage. Now let us be very clear it's not like during their marriage my paternal family has very good financial condition but their(not including my father in anyway) behavior was like my mother came after seeing their \"financial-might\" . It was my father , who after knowing that she is highly educated got more interested in this relation.\n\nMonday's  incident : Now coming to our main topic, after so many years now my grandmother's relation with her elder son and his wife has worsened so much so that she wants to come here. Her elder daughter also does not have any good relation with her elder brother. She also wants the same but will never take her mother to her own home because there is the catch, she can only shout but can't take responsibility.  Few days before she had extremely heated argument with my grandfather over letting her mother in the house but my mother said after one had left the house no one will come here. Furious with this my grandmother,  who repeatedly along with her daughter cursed my maternal grandmother also several times before , went to her best-friend's house , which is just next to our house and told that she never wants to come to our house and also she wants that I will leave and andabandon my mother like this only. Today the mother-daughter duo directly came to our house. First they were arguing with grandfather with every kind of cursing words possible at such high voice that I was having an afternoon nap but wake up immediately.  After I and my mother went downstairs we also have an argument with them.Whole thing is recorded in my phone. They again stated bad words about my mother and maternal grandmother,  at the heat of the argument I was stated my grandmother as a dayin(witch) . Even don't know but how my grandmother fell to the ground and her daughter shouted that I pushed her and that happened . At last my father came home and drove them off from the house. \n\nConclusion:\nTbh we have no relation with them and will treat them like stranger . Just want to know if any legal  way available so that they will not come anymore. It's really hurting my mental state also.\n\nToday : They filed a diary. Tomorrow is the inquiry at police station.

I am trying to find out more about what kind of permissions are required and what the status of the sale deed would be if we can demonstrate in front of the judge that said permissions were not obtained.\n\nSpecifically, are there rules that require cancellation of the sale deed in this case?

I made the lawyers at both cirminal and civil court available today and  I have asked them to appear for the criminal court for the compromise and then in the afternoon we will visit the marriage court and apply for divorce. They are only willing to do the reverse. They are telling they will first come to marriage court and only then visit criminal court in afternoon. I am scared that she might not withdraw the criminal case after I sign the divorce paper as I cannot force them to come to the criminal court.\n\nUpdate : so I decided to not appear for the civil court today. My wife has told judge that I am blackmailing her to withdraw the case. The judge tried to convince her and make her understand that she also needs to withdraw the case but she is not budging. \n\nThanks a lot to all the people that helped me today.

        "title": "Construction company delayed Our Dream Home by 8 Months, Now Asking for More Money – How Can We Fight Back Legally?",
        "text": "We are a young couple in our early 30s from Bangalore. Building our own house was a dream, and three years ago, we bought a plot with a loan from an NBFC (since it has a Panchayat Khata). A 55kV high-tension (HT) wire runs about 10 feet from our site but does not pass directly over it.\n\nAfter registering the plot, we searched for a reputed construction company to build our G+2.5 triplex home, keeping the HT wire in mind. We chose Company X based on their marketing and claimed experience (800 standalone projects completed). The total construction cost was agreed upon, including all taxes, and any extra costs for material changes would be our responsibility.\n\nBoth parties signed an agreement. The company conducted a site analysis, soil test, and feasibility check, confirming that G+2.5 was possible. They committed to completing the project within 12 months and provided a phased timeline. Their payment structure required us to pay only after completing each phase.\n\nInitially, construction progressed, but there were deviations from the approved plan. They assured us these would be fixed later. Then, suddenly, all communication stopped—our site engineer, coordinator, and escalation team ignored our calls for two months. When we visited their office, they claimed workers refused to continue due to the 55kV HT line.\n\nThis was shocking, as they had previously approved the design. After much discussion, we agreed to remove one floor, reducing it to G+1.5, and they resumed work. However, they kept delaying construction, leading to a total delay of six months beyond the agreed timeline.\n\nWhen we confronted the management, they refused to compensate us despite a clause in the agreement stating that delays would make us eligible for compensation. They also ignored our complaints about construction quality. Now, they are demanding additional GST due to miscalculations, even though we had agreed on a GST-inclusive price.\n\nThey still have our money for an unfinished phase and now claim they will complete the project by April, which means an 8-month delay.\n\nHow can we take legal action without spending too much?\n\nSome friends told us that court hearings could cost around ₹35,000 INR per session, which worries us. We want to know our legal options if the work is delayed further or if there are quality issues. Any advice on handling this situation legally and effectively?\n\nTL;DR: Hired a reputed builder for our G+2.5 dream home in Bangalore. They confirmed feasibility, signed a contract, and promised a 12-month timeline. Midway, they stopped responding for two months, citing a 55kV HT line issue (which they knew about earlier). We had to remove a floor (now G+1.5) to resume work. They kept delaying, resulting in a 6-month delay, and now claim it’ll be done by April (8 months late). They refuse compensation, ignore quality concerns, and are demanding extra GST due to their miscalculations. Legal action seems costly—what are our best options as consumers?\n",

Is it normal for consumer electronics brands to refuse post-warranty service, even when the customer is happy to pay?\n\n\n2. Is this even legal in India?

I've prepared my exit procedure and just wanted to clear a few things before I go to avoid further burden while I'm gone. \n\nI've cried plenty of times at almost every comment shared by people stating that I would hurt my parents when I'm gone.. true.. I won't disagree.. but I know time will heal the emotional pain caused by my death. I've gone through enough posts of r/suicidebereavement to know that healing is possible after this loss and my parents can move on and that's enough for me to give enough reassurance to go on with my decision.\n\nI have a gambling disease. Soon I will start taking loans from other NBFCs and loan sharks or heck I'm capable of even risking my parents'hard earned money and might even lead to them selling their blood sweat built house and other materials to bail me out which would mean a world to them.\n\n Don't wanna live in that world, sure I've failed them as a son but don't want to impact and also project my failure and impact their life's hard work... I'm not going anywhere.. I'm just becoming part of this earth back again.. we're all star dusts after all... I've experienced everything... I've lived my life... Too lazy to fix the problems honestly...\n\nI have never been a good son to my parents or a good partner to my gf who attempted to fix me but failed so hard and hurt themselves too and my Manager at work who had no business or actual need to care about my problem went out of his way to give me enough time despite me deliberately slacking off for several weeks or months on end and yet he kept me and I had to step in our of guilt and applied resignation and lied to him that I'll file for Bankruptcy and still he even helped me saying he'll give 1 month mental health break etc or if I'm sure about declaring bankruptcy then he said he can shorten the notice period down from 2 months to 1 week and I chose 1 week.. end of next week I'll be out of salary too which will motivate me further to proceed with the exit plan.. I had plans of running away from home to like mountains and just live off grid but I don't think my snowflake ass raised in the comforts would adapt also not to forget the trauma I would've caused to people around by just running away, if i don't get killed by the harsh surrounding of living life like that I'd for sure die off guilt..\n\nI just can't change anything about myself for good. Everyone's attempt to get me back on track has only led to wasted time and them getting upset. I've never been a man of my word. Heck never even man enough to face trouble too... I'm done blaming everyone else but myself it's time I realise the root cause and kill it. So hence proceeding with killing the root cause. I have lost all hope... Life is stupid. I might be around for another week or two as materials for my exit plan are on their way. One small temporary pain my family will go through in the next few months and they'll enjoy the rest of their lives.\n\nAgain thank you all for giving me a good cry. Needed it.\n\n",

Personally , I thought we have the same level of free speech that US does , but I got to know I am wrong, so here I want to clarify certain things:\n\n1. Can you as an Indian have a personal opinion which is discriminatory but which you share in informal domain like social media apps ?\n\n(E.g : A lot of people have conservative or 'sexist' opinion about gender. Men and even women  about dressing , manner they talk  and conduct themselves , the ability to provide etc.  Apart from formal environment ,  Now if you talk about it on social media , will that be illegal to provide such an opinion ? )\n\n2. If someone makes a public post on social media , will commenting in trolling or roasting qualify as an harassment ? (Ofc giving threats is illegal and punishable and so is making sexual remarks on an SFW post , but apart from that )\n\nA simple yes or no answer will do , however if you can provide any explanation to NO's it will be helpful. \n\nThanks for reading\n\n\n\n",

Additionally, some of my customers have confirmed that they are receiving emails from him.\n\nThe problem: I never had a formal contract with him because I trusted him, but I do have proof of employment (salary slips, transaction records, etc.). I also have customer emails as proof of them receiving unsolicited messages from him.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. What legal options do I have to act against him?\n\n\n2. Can I send an email to my customers asking them to forward me the emails they received from him as additional proof?\n\n\n3.

        "text": "Hello Folks,\n\nMe and my brother have been very close. Last year, He told me about a setup where I lend money to his friend who runs loan business. In return, he will give me interest at 1.5% and also registers one of the land plot on my name. I knew his friend personally since childhood but not close with him. I didn't think much. But I wanted to be safe. I asked the guy to write agreement on bond paper so that if he tries to screw me up, it will hold up legally. Agreement basically states that interested has to be paid monthly and money should be return upon the notice after one year of the lending. I actually work overseas. I trust my brother very much and asked him to be the power of attorney and get this plot registered on my name. I checked with several people. This is legal and can be done. Now, plot got registered on my name but power of attorney was his friend himself. This I came to know only after I received the registration documents. When I question, my brother shrugged it off and said some bullshit reason. Right after this, my brother got married and started a business without even telling me. I suspect there was some kind of arrangement between them to dupe me. I called his friend asked him that I need money and he said he will arrange by June this year. Btw, I lent him money May, 2024. He hasn't paid any interest amount at all. When I asked, he gave all kinds of excuses. I verified the documents in government portal, the plot is on my name. My brother's friend is into politics and kind of has some influence. My worry is that, he may not return the money and won't let me sell the land as well to recover money.\n\nAlso my brother grew distance with me and started telling lies about most of the things. Things haven't been well between us. For all these years, I thought he is the only one I thought I could trust. But it's apparent that I got betrayed by own brother. I once bailed him out of debt of 4 lakhs and took care of him when he got sick and hospitalised. It feels like stab in the heart.\n\nNow I seek your folk's advice on how to challenge this legally. Or is there any better approach to resolve this and recover money. Also my brother's friend being the power of attorney has any implication for my ownership of the plot?\n\nAny lawyer willing take up this? Happy to share the details over DM.",

Fast forward, my crush and I are talking and everything going smoothly. My crush is at granny house for vacation after 12th exam. She has left her phone at her home. Meanwhile her best friend messages me at midnight two days ago. Greeted, chatted, she demanded some money and gave me a number to send there. I tried but it failed. I told her, I'll send in morning. She calls in morning, payment transferred. She mentioned that she needs to share something with me as she's not been honest with me about something.  I assumed money I have sent, goes to the bf. I told her if it is not related to my crush, no need to be honest. Everyone has personal life. She insisted that I have to tell you when I get free.( She's at sister's house for vacation after 12th exam. Same without phone). Everything passed by .... Yesterday I got call from unknown number in midnight. I was on another call, picked the call but no one answered. Same number sent some promotional message on WhatsApp. Didn't bother as I was busy on another call. Now today I got call from same number. Actual issue starts here. He asks if I know my crush? He mentions her sister name. Asks my name and whereabouts. I didn't give any information and denied that I don't know any of these persons.. He then says she's letting you to f*ck her? Other person then says if she's letting you f*ck her then it's alright with us. Hangs up. I called my crush with the help of her sister to her granny number. I let her listen to the recording. She heard everything and she's shattered. She has no clue who these persons are. But I mentioned the money transfer story so she understood that it is her best friend bf side related something. Now I have the recording. I want these guys to apologise to my crush or me. What are my legal opinion here?

        "title": "KIIT's Dark Underbelly: Systematic Negligence & Cover-ups Exposed",
        "text": "I want to begin by clarifying that this post is not intended to harm KIIT University's reputation but rather to shed light on incidents that students have witnessed during their time at the institution.. Many students choose to remain silent because, in the end, they just want to graduate and move on. This silence has allowed numerous serious incidents to remain hidden from the media and public awareness. First and foremost, it is essential to acknowledge that this is not an issue exclusive to KIIT. Many private universities in India operate in similar ways-lacking transparency, suppressing voices, and prioritizing reputation over student welfare. However, as an alumnus who has personally witnessed these incidents unfold, I feel the need to document them so future students and their families can make informed decisions.\n\nIn November and December of 2022, two suicides took place within KIIT. One occurred on November 20 in Boys KP5 Hostel, and another on December 6 in Boys' KP15 Hostel. Both had personal reasons, but the concerning part is not just the lack of media coverage. Every time a suicide occurs, by the time the body is discovered hanging, students are kept away, and untrained KIIT staff are sent instead of professional medical personnel. The body is left hanging for over half to one hour, during which staff take photos and videos before roughly handling it. In many cases, they drop the body as if it were an object, wrap it in a bedsheet, and drag it away. Students attempting to document these moments are threatened with disciplinary action.\n\nA similar incident happened in December 2022, when two female students from KIMS attempted suicide by poisoning. They were rushed to KIMS and barely survived. Another suicide occurred in a girls QC hostel, but unlike the boys' hostels, where at least some rumors circulated, this case was completely silenced. The administration cut the power supply, called in their private security force, and transferred the body without allowing any recording or documentation. Only the deceased's roommates knew what had truly happened.\n\nKIIT has pattern of labeling these deaths as heart attacks to avoid panic. They take possession of the body, bypass police involvement, and conduct internal post-mortems at KIMS to ensure no external Investigation contradicts their claims. While preventing panic among students may be one reason, the administration has begun to exploit this approach to protect its reputation.\n\nIn February 2023, an incident in QC4 Hostel mirrored the infamous Chandigarh University scandal. A girl was caught recording another girl while she was bathing, taking advantage of the poorly designed common washrooms with open-top doors. When confronted, it was discovered that she and her boyfriend had been selling such videos online. The affected students protested, demanding strict action, but instead of supporting them, the warden dismissed their concerns, telling them, \"It's not your video that was Leaked.\" The administration then assisted the accused in escaping serious punishment. Within a month, they were back in class, and the matter was silenced.\n\nOn March 18, 2024, a major food contamination issue occurred in KP15 Hostel. Due to negligence by the hostel mess authorities, over 40 students contracted jaundice, and one died while being treated at KIMS. Yet, once again, the university avoided accountability. The student's death was officially classified as a \"natural cause,\" and instead of addressing the root problem, they merely issued a warning to the mess staff without making any real changes...\n\nKIIT's approach to handling such cases follows a troubling pattern. First, they suppress the news, ensuring it does not reach external sources. Second, they silence students through threats of disciplinary action. Third, they manipulate the cause of death or incident details to avoid responsibility. Then, they protect the perpetrators rather than the victims.\n\nStudents at KIIT have observed how the institution maintains its fabricated reputation through bribed rankings and manipulated statistics. The ranking system itself has raised suspicions, as KIIT's high placements in NIRF, THE, and NAAC appear to be influenced by strong political connections and financial dealings rather than genuine academic excellence. Placement statistics are often exaggerated, with outdated or fabricated data used to portray a better image. The research culture at KIIT has also been questionable. Many professors publish multiple peer-reviewed papers every two months, which is an unrealistic pace for quality research. Students who have looked into these papers have found citations in completely unrelated works, making it clear that these publications are not as legitimate as they are made out to be.\n\nThe recent case of the Nepali student's death has been the first instance where KIIT failed to suppress an incident. Initially, KIIT staff forcibly removed Nepali students from campus using local security personnel, but after international attention-particularly from the Nepalese Prime Minister-they had no choice but to backtrack. Suddenly, the administration pretended to cooperate, despite earlier intimidation tactics. Videos have surfaced of staff, the founder, and even professors threatening. students to protect the university's reputation.\n\nI am not writing this out of personal grudge against KIIT. These incidents have happened, and students are aware of them. The reason people don't speak up is that they just want to graduate and leave. This normalization of injustice allows these institutions to continue operating with impunity.\n\nIf you witness an incident, document it. Even if you cannot act on it now, evidence can be useful in the future. Universities should be places of learning, not fear. This post is not about spreading hate-it is about ensuring transparency and accountability in private institutions across India. Every student deserves to know the reality before making one of the most important decisions of their life.\n\nIf this post reaches someone from the media, investigative organizations, or legal authorities, please consider looking deeper into these matters. The students and their families deserve transparency and justice. The normalization of such incidents should not continue unchecked. Peace.",

I have gathered evidence of both the threats to kill me and hurling things. I am frankly worried about my safety and thus I’m mulling legal options. However, I am also worried because I don’t have a prenup and my wife constantly threatens that she will pursue divorce, but she doesn’t. I believe it’s a tactic to induce compliance to her demands out of fear.\n\nWhat are the legal options I can pursue here? I’m worried about both my safety and divorce (being forced to part with a significant chunk of my hard-earned wealth will set me back quite a bit).

Then he repaid the loan to the bank while dissolving partners A, B & C. Which means, his wife & daughter now owns 100% of the company. However, he did not register the property in the name of D & E, as he is under the impression that there are 2 partners remaining who automatically own all assets (movable & immovable) & liabilities of the company which includes the property too. \n\nOur lawyer mentioned that he needs to register a new deed with the municipality clearly stating the change of ownership of the **property** from the old partners A, B & C to the new partners D & E which will incur stamp duty (which he is trying to avoid paying stating it's an accepted practice).\n\nIs it wise to buy such a property where the deed/dolil still has the old partners and not the new ones? Is retiring of the old partners mean that the new partners automatically are new owners of the company AND the property as well without registering it? \n\nAny advice would be really appreciated. ",

        "title": "Caught a Thief Who Stole ₹1.95L from My GF’s Dad, but Now the Cops Are After Me – Need Advice",
        "text": "Hey everyone, this is my first post, so please excuse any mistakes. I’m 22M and a second-year law student at Delhi University.\n\nEarlier today, my girlfriend’s dad went out to buy groceries and ended up befriending someone. Unfortunately, this guy saw his debit card PIN, stole the card, and withdrew ₹1,95,000 in multiple transactions. We only realized what had happened in the evening.\n\nWith the help of a mutual friend who had been with them, we tracked the guy down. He was acting innocent and even came with us to the police station, pretending to help. The police also suspected him and registered our complaint, asking us to return the next day once they check the cameras as it was too late and the stores and ATMs had probably shut. After that, my girlfriend’s dad did not come with us.\n\nSince we were sure he was the one, we bluffed and told him we had CCTV footage. That’s when he confessed and agreed to return the money. But soon after, he switched off his phone. Panicked, we searched for him all over Sector 56, Gurgaon, and even asked the police to check his house around 11 PM. They told us to go home, but just as we were leaving, the mutual friend informed us that the thief was planning to escape to Jammu.\n\nAt this point, we had a choice—leave it to the cops (who had done nothing so far) or take action ourselves. Despite being scared, my girlfriend, her mom, and I decided to go out one last time. I knew the risk involved, but I wasn’t going to let him get away. We eventually found him in Sikanderpur, one of the sketchiest areas in Gurgaon. This place is known to be a red-light area, and it was definitely not safe for my girlfriend and her mom to be there at that hour. As soon as the thief saw me, he ran. At that moment, I knew I had to act. I chased him down, pushed him so he fell, and held him down while calling the cops.\n\nThis was honestly one of the bravest things I’ve ever done. I was terrified, but I still did what was right. In a city where people hesitate to step up, I literally did the police’s job for them.\n\nSeeing the commotion, some people nearby asked what was happening. When they heard that he had stolen money and was trying to run, around 10–12 guys gathered and started beating him. We tried to stop them (I even got punched in the process), but it escalated quickly. Under pressure, the guy returned some money and tried running again, which led to another round of beatings. Eventually, he gave back around ₹1,75,000.\n\nAt this point, we were genuinely scared. Sikanderpur is not a safe area, and with 12 unknown guys surrounding us, we were worried that they could turn on us at any moment or even run away with our money. We just wanted to leave. I spotted a police car and flagged them down. They caught him, and soon after, the officers from Sector 56 arrived.\n\nThat’s when things got messy. The police didn’t scold us—they outright told me that the thief would be charged with theft, and I would be charged with “maar-peet” (assault). It felt like a warning. I told them I didn’t hit him, but the bystanders did. The thief himself even told the cops that we didn’t harm him, and I recorded a video of him saying that. But the police looked pissed, especially after I recorded the video, and now they’ve asked us to come to the station at 9 AM tomorrow. They also suspect the involvement of the mutual friend.\n\nNow I’m feeling really anxious. I didn’t do anything wrong—I literally did their job for them. I was scared but still stepped up and showed courage. And yet, instead of being appreciated, I’m the one being threatened. We’re relieved to have gotten most of the money back and are fine with not pressing charges, considering the thief’s sad personal situation.\n\nWhat should we do now? Should we proceed with the charges despite not wanting to? Can the cops actually take action against me? They seemed really pissed off. Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nUPDATE: The parents went to the police station, around 20k are still to be recovered and the guy is saying he will pay back. I am not sure of the details because I am in college, but the parents have “thanked” the police people for being there yesterday, and nothing has really happened so far. I will update further.",

Outlier has 2 ways of transfer one was through Airtm which uses person 2 person transfer of money. My friend took around 8k loan from me so he said to withdraw money in my account to repay me. I had no idea of this p2p scam.\n\nafter I received the money I sent 2k to my friend and then after 20 days I saw the bank had held the exact amount. I got to know Cybercell had held the money so I talked to the bank to get the complaint id then I connected the cybercell which held my money they said that someone had scammed someone and that money was transferred to someone else and then to another person. Basically I am at the 5th layer of receiving the money. \n\nI have all the proofs that my friend has earned the money in legit way. I even asked the cyber cell to see the FIR he said that there was no name of mine and it was the case between 2 persons and my money was held due to the usual procedure which happens when a fraud transaction is done or money is suspicious.\n\nWhat should I do? Should I be worried? I have done nothing wrong neither I have done freelancing nor it is my money it is my friend's money which is earned in a legal way ",

I ordered a Sony Xperia 1 III from them, but after placing the order, I realized they hadn’t mentioned that it was a single SIM variant instead of dual SIM. I immediately tried to cancel on February 4, but they refused.\n\nLater, they assured me via WhatsApp video that I would receive the exact device shown, which was in Superb Condition (highest grade). However, when I received the device, it had:\n\nWrong IMEI number (different from what was shown)\n\nScratches despite being \"Superb\" condition\n\nBattery issues (random shutdowns)\n\n\nI contacted them multiple times through calls, emails, and WhatsApp, but they kept ignoring me. On February 14, after repeated follow-ups, they still hadn’t resolved my issue, so I filed a Cyber Crime complaint (Acknowledgment No. 23202250009283) and now I’ve also filed an online Consumer Complaint.\n\nOn E-Jagriti, I saw that I need to upload multiple documents, including a notarized affidavit. Since I don’t have much money for a lawyer, I drafted my own documents.\n\nCan I just get a ₹10 notary affidavit, print my complaint, and submit it, or do I need legal help?

Here’s everything that happened:\n\nI was working on a client project when I asked a colleague (who works for the client) for financial help. He escalated this to management because he didn’t want to directly say no. As a result, I was removed from the project.\n\nInstead of assigning me to another project, my employer claimed that a written complaint was filed against me for asking for money. However, to my knowledge, no such complaint exists. The only document they have is an offboarding form that lists the reason for my removal as \"behavioral issues.\"\n\nThey then asked me to submit a resignation letter. I didn’t want to resign, but they pressured me by saying that if I left the room without doing so, I would be terminated immediately. Feeling cornered, I wrote the resignation letter.\n\nThey also asked me to write an apology letter, saying it would help them reconsider their decision. I wrote the apology, hoping to keep my job or at least leave on better terms. However, they are now using this apology against me as evidence that I admitted to asking for financial help, even though there is no official complaint or evidence beyond this letter.\n\nAfter submitting my resignation, I requested the official 3-month notice period, which is clearly stated in my company’s policy. However, they are denying my request for the notice period, and I believe they are doing this to avoid paying me for those three months.\n\nI feel that:\n\nMy resignation was forced under pressure.\n\nThey are misusing my apology letter against me.\n\nThey are unfairly denying my official notice period.\n\n\nI need advice on the following:\n\nCan I contest my resignation since it was written under duress?\n\nDo I have a legal right to the 3-month notice period as per company policy?\n\nHow should I handle the misuse of my apology letter?\n\nHas anyone faced a similar situation, and how did you resolve it?",

My family was coerced into signing an unfair property agreement in 2021, and we are struggling to get justice.\n\nAt the time, the property was valued at around 3-4 crore, but my father, who is now 68 years old and facing severe health issues, was given just 15 lakhs for his rightful share. My parents were under extreme financial distress during the Covid crisis, and they were forced into a \"take it or leave it\" situation with no time to properly understand or read the agreement, which was written in Gujarati.\n\nMoreover, when the agreement was signed, the people who attended were all biased and were my uncles' people. No one from our side was present to help us or ensure that the process was fair.\n\nIn 2023, we sent a formal notice to my uncles, requesting our rightful share of the property. Unfortunately, they ignored the notice. Later, we filed a police complaint, and although the police initially promised to take action, nothing happened after a local influential figure, who is politically connected, intervened. This person has been helping my uncles avoid any responsibility, and when my father sought his help, he mocked my father instead of offering assistance. The individual told my father that he could file a case against him if he wanted, fully aware that we cannot afford to take legal action.\n\nWe are now in a very difficult position. Our financial situation is dire, and my father’s health is deteriorating . We have copies of all the notices we’ve sent, as well as the police complaint, but due to the political influence of this individual, we aren't getting justice we seeking for and we can't afford fees of an lawyer either. \n\nIf anyone knows a lawyer who might be willing to take this case or can offer any other advice or support, we would be incredibly grateful. We just want justice and our rightful share of the property.\n\nThank you for reading and for any help you can offer.",

        "text": "Hello, I am seeking legal advice regarding the recent tragic incident at KIIT University, where a Nepali female student reportedly passed away under suspicious circumstances. Reports suggest potential foul play, and there are allegations of institutional negligence and mishandling of the case by authorities.\n\nFrom what I understand, the university and local law enforcement have not been fully transparent about the situation. There are concerns regarding a lack of proper investigation, suppression of evidence, and possible pressure on the victim’s family and witnesses.\n\nAdditionally, reports indicate that when people protested against the handling of the case, Nepali students were told to leave the campus immediately, with many being evicted overnight. The eviction involved lathi charges, physical beatings, bruising, and other forms of excessive force. This action appears to be a violation of human rights and raises serious concerns about discrimination and arbitrary treatment of international students.\n\nWe also have recordings of the wardens speaking ill not only of Nepali people but also of Nepal as a country and our embassy. While we eventually received apologies, it was evident that these were primarily issued to protect KIIT’s reputation rather than as a genuine acknowledgment of wrongdoing.\n\nNow that the Embassy of Nepal has intervened, the university is calling all the students back, raising further questions about their motives and accountability in handling the situation.\n\nFor further context, here are some links to news articles and social media discussions about the case:\n\n* [https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/new-updates/kiit-student-suicide-police-arrest-21-year-old-boy-in-connection-with-nepali-students-death/articleshow/118344902.cms?from=mdr](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/new-updates/kiit-student-suicide-police-arrest-21-year-old-boy-in-connection-with-nepali-students-death/articleshow/118344902.cms?from=mdr)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bhubaneswar/comments/1is88l2/apology\\_video\\_by\\_manjusha\\_pandey\\_one\\_of\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bhubaneswar/comments/1is88l2/apology_video_by_manjusha_pandey_one_of_the/)\n\nGiven the gravity of the situation, I have a few legal questions:\n\n1. **What legal actions can be taken to ensure a proper and impartial investigation?** Would filing a writ petition in the High Court for a CBI or SIT inquiry be feasible?\n2. **Can university officials be held accountable for negligence or suppression of information?** If so, under what legal provisions?\n3. **What are the legal rights of students who want to protest or demand justice for the victim?** How can they do so while ensuring their safety and avoiding legal repercussions?\n4. **If evidence suggests homicide, what steps should be taken to push for a fair trial and prevent any political or institutional influence on the case?**\n5. **What recourse does the victim’s family have if they are facing coercion or pressure to settle or remain silent?**\n\nAny legal insights or recommendations on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, if there are any lawyers or legal organizations specializing in such cases, guidance on whom to approach would be helpful.\n\nThank you in advance for your advice.",

I need to appear for IRS Enrolled agent exam, a set of 3 papers which I need to give to practice US tax. I am an Indian resident holding an Indian passport and the problem is I am not getting slots for the exams in India. My question is can I give the exam abroad in their testing centres which are in London, Seoul, Tokyo or Toronto. Do I need to have a specific visa type to appear in these exams or a simple tourist visa will be ok. \nAlternatively has anyone given a CFA/other exams abroad what travel documents did they ask when the Indian testing centres were blocked for any testing?\nThanks in Advance.",

The client changed his mind at the end of the project deadline and is now asking for different concepts as he didn't like the current one which he approved initially. He's threatening to take legal action stating that I'm breaching the contract (I didn't, I did all the work timely, he's just unhappy with the current logo) and post about me on LinkedIn if I refuse and blaming me of breaching the contract by not providing revisions (He thinks revisions mean totally new concepts, I'm ready to give revisions on the current concept but cannot make new concepts from scratch in the name of revision).\n\nCan he actually do something? Moreover, I was ready to comply and find a solution but then he sent me a notice for contract compliance. His defense is that he never fully agreed to the current logo and is dissatisfied and that I should now start from scratch and design new concepts. Can the contract protect me? Will he actually do something or is just trying to threaten me? He has my personal details and address. \n\nI do not wish to get into any legal trouble, it's just i cannot comply because the deadline is over and I have my exams coming up, so I don't have time for his further tantrums.\n\nI can share screenshots of contract and mail over dm as the subreddit doesn't allow attaching images",

        "title": "Scammy subcontractor extorts money attacking IT infrastructure",
        "text": "I run a small IT business in Singapore, and we hired a local company to redesign our website. We didn't realize they would hire an overseas subcontractor (in India) to do the technical parts. After numerous delays and botched assignments, we insisted on getting more involved in the process, and found out the truth. The subcontractor is a small boutique company without much expertise in the task at hand. The project was going so badly that we had to involve our own developers for help (they don't know the subject either but have functional brains). Nevertheless, the project was nearing completion.\n\nA few days ago, we woke up to see that our website in progress is completely gone. At the same day, I was contacted by the subcontractor who said that our designers did not pay him *for other projects* and stopped talking to him. To \"fix\" the situation, he deleted all the files on our server (!!!) and wants me to pay him \"to complete the job\". When I asked, what is there to complete, he couldn't remember. (The correct answer is, their part was nearly done and what was left was beyond their level of expertise.)\n\nSo basically, he sabotaged infrastructure of his customer's customer who had no dealings with him.\n\nFrom the conversation with our prime contact, it appears that the subcontractor's team botched three other projects to the point that the customers walked away, but that they were paid the deposit.\n\nLuckily, the guy is as stupid as dishonest. The source code was copied so we restored it, and changed the credentials. Unfortunately, we forgot about one loophole. And, sure enough, at night he logged on again (through his normal login) and deleted more files.\n\nWe are currently restoring it, but assuming it might escalate, what is the best way to handle it? I doubt police will take care of something as trivial and relatively bloodless. Is there a way to blacklist them or something, beyond leaving bad reviews and listing as scammers?",

        "text": "My friend is a director of a company and their payroll team mistakenly paid an ex-employee for 8 or 9 months after he left, due to a payroll error. The amount is between INR 80,000 and 1,00,000. The company had asked the ex-employee to return the money, they are not even asking for the PF, ESI, or other contributions. The ex-employee claims his father is in debt, so he is unable to repay the amount immediately.\n\nThe company has agreed to let him repay in 6 monthly installments, but they want him to sign an agreement and issue a post-dated cheque, which would only be cashed if he defaults on repayment. The agreement also mentions consequences under the Negotiable Instruments Act if the cheque bounces. The ex-employee is hesitant to sign this agreement, feeling it is too legal, but the company is willing to remove the fixed dates for payment, requiring only fixed monthly amounts.\n\nI want to help my friend as much as i can so the company recovers the amount from ex-employee as soon as possible.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1) What legal actions can we take if the ex-employee refuses to sign the agreement or defaults on repayment?\n\n2) Is the ex-employee legally obligated to repay the amount, even though it was a payroll mistake?\n\n3) Can we still charge him legally or recover the money without a signed agreement from the ex-employee?\n\nAny legal insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\n\n\nEDIT -----------------------------------\nI had phrased the og post improperly (Have edited it now) \n\nSome people thought my friend is the ex-employee who hasn’t paid back, and others thought I’m the ex-employee.\nTo clarify, my friend is the director of a new company, and I want to help him recover money from an ex-employee who hasn’t paid what they owe.\n\nAny advice or suggestions on how to go about this would be greatly appreciated.

He said if he feels like giving her something he will or he wont. And he doesnt care what she thinks or wants. He wants to make himself the first owner of this apartment and my unmarried uncle as second owner.

Now I moved back to a development project where I am well recieved and I was trying for a promotion and now the talent team of the company raised another IAP because they feel my ratings are low which offcourse they will be due to 2 back to back IAPs. I feel like firm is trying push me out, offcourse the best course will be to leave it but is there something I can do legally regarding this miss management? ",

        "text": "Nowadays I am seeing an frauds being committed on unsuspecting sellers in the crypto world and they are now the target of new age scammers specialising in digital arrest, TRAI fraud, DHL and other frauds. These New Age Scammer (NAS) are targeting young, inexperienced sellers on crypto currency platforms and paying on P2P mode and invariably the seller is on the radar of Cyber crime police stations across India who are asking the sellers to return the money to the complainant, or they mark a lien on their bank account or even freeze all the bank accounts in the Bank having a common PAN.  The NAS gets to launder his ill-gotten money for crypto, as keeping the money in other so-called mule accounts gets frozen and buying crypto currency literally dries up the money trail.\n\nSo all guys out there who are wanting to do crypto trading, be extremely careful . If an FIR gets registered, then getting yourself discharged in a criminal case across the country in a district court which is far away from home can be a money and emotion draining exercise. High Courts (if one approaches HC for quashing an FIR) will not entertain such petitions and ask you to cooperate in the Police Investigation and take it a logical conclusion, which can take anywhere between 3-5 years depending on how good the Investigating Officer is. So, one ends up paying for local advocate, travel and dealing with Police or courts which don't know how Crypto trading takes places or how payments are given and taken.\n\nI have written this based on my experience with young persons who have been scammed by NAS recently in 3 cases and in all of the cases they have sold crypto on P2P basis.\n\nJust to be understand and summarize (**AI generated**) :\n\n1. **Use Reputable Platforms**: Choose well-established platforms like Binance, Coinbase, and Bitpay for security.\n2. **Verify Trading Partners**: Check profiles, reviews, and transaction history before trading.\n3. **Enable 2FA**: Add an extra layer of security to your accounts.\n4. **Avoid Phishing Scams**: Be cautious of suspicious emails and websites.\n5. **Secure Environment**: Ensure your device is malware-free and updated.\n6. **Use Secure Payments**: Prefer irreversible methods like bank transfers.\n7. **Check Addresses**: Double-check transaction addresses before sending funds.\n8. **Protect Seed Phrases**: Keep your seed phrase secure and private.\n9. **Stay Informed**: Educate yourself about common scams.\n10. **Report Suspicious Activity**: Report any suspicious activity to the platform.\n11. **Use Escrow Services**: Utilize escrow services for added security.\n12. **Be Cautious**: Avoid offers that seem too good to be true.",

From I tried calling the bus operator 50 times but he didn’t pick the call. On redbus, there was no number given to contact either bus driver or conductor.  Now it was 2am in the night. We called redbus customer support multiple times but told us to wait for few more minutes but no sign of bus. Worried about our safety we decided to take a cab from Lucknow to Delhi (which costed around 9k). Next I called the redbus support again and explained the situation. After a while, got a mail that I will be getting 1500 rupees as refund of the bus ticket for which I paid 5200 rupees for two tickets. I have been trying to call redbus support again and again but these shamesless MFs are cutting the call abruptly. I am intending to take this matter legally. Any kind of help/advice would be helpful because the kind of inconvenience me and my friend had to face is much beyond the amount they have refunded or the way they are handling it. ",

I became reliant on alcohol at one point of my life. \n\nI lost my life in front of me on this pursuit.A day, a lady cop took me and mother in their van to the police station.i can never forget that day in my life...Thinking of that gets me into tears everyday of my life. \n\nThere was a time were I broke down in the court while the milord smirked at my plight. I have always played by the rules in my life and my honesty was of no value.\nThe judge made sarcastic comments in the hearing.\n Nobody even heard me, even the court..my eye are just flowing while I write this and no man should ever go through this.\n\nI was at the brink of death but I couldn't do it. I recovered from it. I don't know how I'm able to live today but I'm existing \n\nI'm not good with words when I'm emotional \n",

The individual in question comes from a wealthy background, which seems to grant him immunity from facing murder charges. I'm truly stunned by the lack of murder charges against him. Both the judge overseeing this case and the lawyer defending the accused, who has taken the lives of two individuals, appear deeply rotten and they lack a moral compass. What steps can we take to rectify this injustice and reclaim this case?   \nIt's unacceptable that wealth can serve as a ticket to evade the consequences of murder.",

        "text": "My friend and I visited Goa from January 11th to 14th and stayed at a place called Hotel Vibes Inn in Nagoa, next to the church. Initially, everything seemed fine. The caretaker, a man named Saleh Ahmed, was polite, and we even offered him food during our stay.\n\nOn January 14th, the day of our checkout, we left the room at 11 AM but kept our luggage at the hotel since our bus back was at 9 PM. The hotel has a common washroom on the ground floor connected to the caretaker's quarters. Before heading out to explore Mapusa, I went to the washroom to change.\n\nLater, my friend went to use the same washroom, and that’s when everything went wrong. She came out crying, visibly shaken, and told me Saleh Ahmed had been peeping at her through the washroom window. I was furious and immediately called the Anjuna Police Station.\n\nThe police arrived quickly and took Saleh Ahmed into custody. Shockingly, the hotel owner tried to bribe us to withdraw the FIR. All the washroom windows in the hotel were connected to a passage, making it easy for someone to spy.\n\nThis incident happened yesterday (January 14th) at around 7:15 PM. I’ve been trying to get a copy of the FIR, but the police keep telling me that the server is down. Can someone guide me on how to escalate this or ensure I get the FIR?\n\nMy friend is traumatized by the incident, and it’s heartbreaking to see her go through this. I feel responsible for choosing this hotel, which turned what should have been a relaxing vacation into a nightmare.\n\nI’m sharing this to warn others: Do not book rooms at Hotel Vibes Inn in Nagoa, Goa. You never know who might be watching.\n\nWe’re pursuing this case legally because no one should have to experience this violation of privacy and trust. Please stay safe, and if anyone has advice on how to handle the delay in obtaining the FIR, I’d greatly appreciate your help.\n\nEdit 1: Thank you so much, everyone, for the support. I’ve received the FIR copy.",

One night when we both were drinking, she got very angry and fought about why i asked her to pay half in our wedding. We split all expenses in our wedding equally. Suddenly she was on top of me and started slapping me for 4- 5 times. I was utterly shocked. I didn’t know what to do so i went in washroom for sometime. She also broke glass. This is 8 months old incident. Since then she has been fighting over very small issues and i am ignoring as breaking marriage is not easy thing to do. She has embarrassed me in front of my friends too. I am very sad that I’m living with same woman with no fault of mine. Somehow she also manages to put all blames on me and now I’m confused if it is is my fault. Is it healthy to stay in this relationship? It is also affecting my work, I’m sole earner in my family and she doesn’t seem to care at all about financials and peace at home. Please advise. I’m also very much worried what happens if we decides to separate knowing indian laws. Can someone guide me what are my options legally ?",

        "text": "I’m feeling extremely stressed and helpless right now, so I really need you to hear me out. Recently, I had to return my office laptop because it was my last day at the company. They forced me to hand it over immediately, and since the termination was so sudden and unexpected, I didn’t have time to log out of my personal Gmail. My personal Gmail was linked to some office-related newsletters, but I didn’t think much of it at the time because I assumed they would reset the laptop.\n\nYesterday, the IT person from the company contacted me, advising me to log out of my personal Gmail. I explained to him that the termination was rushed, and I simply hadn’t had the chance, but there was nothing suspicious in my emails anyway. However, during the conversation, he confessed that he had accessed my GOOGLE PHOTOS linked to that account—going through 10 years of my personal photos under the pretence of “company policy.”\n\nHe claimed to have found some private photos, including ones I wasn’t even aware were saved there. He said he SAVED THEM, stating he “had a great time” going through my pictures. He even sent me some of the photos as proof and went on to make inappropriate advances, telling me he’d liked me from the beginning and that now, after seeing my photos, he wanted to “taste me.” He made further comments about us having “great chemistry.”\n\nI was terrified and didn’t know how to respond. Out of fear, I told him I’d meet him in person to discuss this, though I have no intention of doing so. When I asked him politely to delete the photos, he said he would but implied he was doing me a favor and expected something in return. He was persistent about meeting in person, drinking, and doing things I am absolutely uncomfortable with. He also said that if someone else had accessed the photos, they wouldn’t have kept them to themselves, implying that I owed him for his “discretion.”\n\nI feel so violated and unsure of what to do. My friends have told me I shouldn’t have agreed to meet him, and I realize now how unsafe that would be. I never thought something like this could happen. The company is a small startup with no HR or POSH policies, and I don’t trust anyone there to help me. I’m terrified he might use these photos to blackmail me, and I don’t believe he will delete them as he claims. I’m also scared that pursuing legal action might provoke him to distribute the photos, which I desperately want to avoid.\n\nI do have recordings of our conversation because my phone automatically records calls from unsaved numbers. This situation has left me shaken, and I just can’t stop thinking about it. I need advice on what to do next.",

He didn't ask for money or anything and only threatened me with legal action for the loss of vision caused to his son due to my advice. I told my parents immediately and they have my back 100%. I have call recordings of me expressly telling my friend not to use too much ice otherwise it can hurt your face and his father threatening me. We have a great family lawyer but he is not available till next sunday. Please I don't care if you're a lawyer or not just any advice on this will be greatly appreciated.\n\nEDIT- after much effort I gathered the guts to call the father again and he said the loss of vision is temporary and he has been prescribed eye drops. The vision is back but its still blurry and they have to check in with the doctor after a week. He asked me not to contact his son again and ended the call.

After that i called 112, and a pcr van came to our house, relatively quickly (mere 15 mins). He was taken to police station and booked under POSCO and 354D. His offenses ( as per my lawyer) are mental harrasment, stalking, sexualizing a minor and sexual harrasment of a minor. He will be spending the time in jail till the court decides his total jailtime. According to my lawyer, he'll be doing atleast 5 years of jailtime with some fines too.\n\nHis family spent atleast 2 hours arguing, pleading and crying in front of me to let him go. He, on the other hand, was acting tryhard in station, till he came to know that stalking is a literal crime. That wiped the 'cool' smirk of his face.",

My friends noticed that he was always very conscious of what people talked about him. When we had a few fights he forbid me from telling anyone about it. Now that he has “gotten” me, he has lost all interest. He doesn’t come home from work until 2 AM, talking about it always ends up in a big fight. He gets very defensive, and today he ended up hitting me. My face is all red and swollen. \nHe perhaps did it in the heat of the moment without intending to hit so badly but he refuses to apologise or even acknowledge it. He says I always cry for smallest things. He even convinced me not to visit a therapist saying do not go down that hole. \nPlease help on what should I do. Am I overreacting?  \nEdit: There is no financial trouble, both of us have a well paying job. ",

        "title": "Discrimination Against My 5-Year-Old Son at School Over His Lunch – Need Advice & Awareness",
        "text": "I never thought I’d have to write something like this, but here we are. I need advice and support, and most importantly, I want to raise awareness about **food-based discrimination in schools**.\n\n# What Happened?\n\nMy **5-year-old son**, who attends **Global Indian International School (GIIS) in Ahmedabad**, was **forced to sit in a corner alone** during lunch because he had a **boiled egg in his tiffin/lunchbox**.\n\nHis class teacher told him that **his food was “unhealthy”**, while the rest of the class—**all vegetarian children** (claimed by the teacher)—sat together and ate. This **wasn't an accident**. It has happened before, but this time, our son finally spoke up because **he couldn’t take it anymore**.\n\nImagine a young child, excited for lunch, only to be **isolated and shamed for something as simple as eating an egg.**\n\n# The Bigger Issue – Psychological Impact on My Son\n\n* **He now thinks eating eggs is bad.** He came home and asked us, *“Papa, why do I eat unhealthy food?”*\n* **Other kids have started bullying him.** Since the teacher segregated him, classmates have started seeing him as “different.”\n* **He felt punished for something completely normal.** At five years old, he is **questioning himself, his food, and even our parenting.**\n\nThis is **not just about my child**—this kind of **subtle discrimination** can create **deep psychological scars** in kids at such a young age.\n\n# Our Complaint to the School – The Director’s Shocking Response\n\nWe officially complained to the school and met with the **director**—expecting them to listen, apologize, and correct this unacceptable behavior. Instead, we were met with **aggression and dismissal.**\n\n* The **school has NO official policy banning eggs or non-vegetarian food.**\n* The **school director admitted** that there’s no complaint from other parents about our son eating eggs.\n* But then, **he doubled down**, saying *\"If you continue sending eggs, your son will continue to sit alone.\"*\n* His **excuse?** *“Be sensitive! If parents find out that their vegetarian kids are eating next to a child with eggs, they will oppose the school.”*\n* He himself is **a non-vegetarian (a Christian), yet he was enforcing this “rule” to avoid controversy.**\n\nThis **hypocrisy is infuriating**! If the school truly wanted to **protect \"sensitive\" children**, then:\n\n* Why **aren't Jain kids forced to sit alone** when others eat onions or garlic?\n* Why **aren't lactose-intolerant kids separated** when others drink milk?\n* Why **aren't gluten-free kids sitting in a corner** when wheat is served?\n\n# Food Segregation in Schools – A Dangerous Trend?\n\nThis is **not about vegetarian vs. non-vegetarian**. I **fully respect** vegetarianism and religious food preferences. However, **forcing a child to sit alone** because of his lunch creates **a culture of exclusion** that is dangerous for young minds.\n\nInterestingly, **some schools in Tamil Nadu serve eggs in mid-day meals** to ensure children get proper nutrition. If government schools can accept eggs, why is a so-called “international” school in Ahmedabad discriminating against it?\n\n# What We Are Doing Next\n\n1. **We have filed an official complaint** with the **CBSE Board** and the **Gujarat Education Department** via the PG Portal.\n2. **We will take this issue to social media** to create awareness about food-based discrimination in schools.\n3. **We are considering legal action**, as this is **a clear violation of a child’s rights** under the Right to Education (RTE) Act.\n\n# How Can You Help?\n\n* **Have you faced similar issues in Indian schools?** Please share your experiences.\n* **How should we push back legally?** Any lawyers or activists willing to guide us?\n* **Should we take this to the media?** Would this help create enough noise to hold the school accountable?\n\nWe are a **truly international family**—my wife is **American/Cuban**, and we have **always embraced diversity**. We never judge what others eat or believe in. But what happened to our son is **not okay**.\n\nNo child should be **isolated and humiliated** for eating something that is **not banned and is completely normal in millions of Indian households.**\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts. How should we proceed? 🤝",

        "text": "I’m honestly at a loss here and could really use some advice.\n\nSo, my friend and I were staying in the same PG. We were really close—he even told his parents I was his best friend. Since he was a minor, I helped him out with almost everything—studies, daily stuff, you name it. After Diwali, he texted me saying he’d broken up with his girlfriend, and when he got back to the PG, he seemed really down and depressed.\n\nMy friends and I noticed how low he was, so we did everything we could to lift his spirits. We took him out to eat, went on walks, just tried to keep him company and cheer him up. Then, a few days later, he attempted suicide. He’s okay now, thankfully, but here’s where things took a turn.\n\nApparently, he told his parents that I was the one who pushed him into it, that I pressured him to do it. Last night, I got a call from his parents accusing me of driving him to suicide. I immediately called his brother to explain the situation, and his brother reassured me that it would be fine, that he’d handle it.\n\nBut this morning, his parents showed up at our PG, and without giving me a chance to explain anything, they started yelling at me and then they actually hit me (I got beaten pretty bad). They wouldn’t listen to a word I said.\n\nI don’t want my parents involved in this because I don’t want to worry them. But I can’t understand why he would say this about me. The entire PG knows we were close, and he was with me the day before he tried to take his life.\n\nAny advice on how to handle this?",

You disrespect our 'Ram', we'll beat you up.\n\nAll of this while recording my brother and his friends.\n\nNow, that Youtuber has upload a Short on his channel and he has portrayed my brother as some guy who is disrespecting Ram.

My initial thought was to go find the YouTuber and break a limb on him but I want to tackle this legally.\n\nPlease suggest me what I can do or not do.\n\nAlso, please feel free to ask any questions.",

        "text": "\n\nI (17M)am really sad rn and my heart is sinking so fast from the past few weeks,so my mom talks to a aunty on phone frequently and she puts on earphone everytime and locks the door to talk with her and even while chatting she keeps her phone entirely tilted. I was surprised but didn't mind much, my sister (11) however tried to see what was happening. The chats used to get deleted every 12 hours or so and the WhatsApp being used had a password that my sis and me cracked down. A few weeks into the investigation my sister said it's a guy and his English is very bad, like he writes WhatsApp as whotsup. I only know the name of his wife let suppose Pooja, but there are like 10 poojas ik that mom knows. After some time mom would go out with him and we catched up but we thought it's still a girl with bad English, once moms phone rang and it was him but with a girl's name as I said before. I asked mom and she said it's some girl from her college days . But, my sister still sneaked in om the chats and disaster struck as we saw the chats of all the cheating and intimate stuff. Worse shit is he asks mom to send all the chats she had with everyone in a day and she sends it and also recording of our camera it's really creepy and scary.My mom acts so normal you can't even think she would do that. I loved her so much. She did a lot of hard work when my dad was down financially for some time.\n\nAlso I am preparing for entrance exams and will go to college this or next year and idk what to do my sister will be home alone and I can't do shit about it\n\nShould I tell my dad or wait and also we have pets, and a house and some lannd and things I am not aware of please help me this has been burdening me and I cant perform in exams due to this, I also have an exam in 4 days with 4 more exams left after that, and if I have to take a drop idk what I will do. \n\nMy dad works a job and mom does some stuff too but not job. \n\nIf I tell my dad everything will be over and idk how he will react too, to make the matters worse what if that guy blackmails or something as he has a wife too.\n\nPLEASE HELP ME, I also have a sister and she cries everyday while I can just hug her pleaseee help",

        "text": "In 2021, a distraught mother approached my office, seeking help for her daughter, let us call her Sara, who had been brutally assaulted by a trusted family friend.\n\nI remember listening to her carefully as she recounted her harrowing experience, her voice trembling with fear and pain. I ensured that Sara received the necessary medical and psychological support before delving into the legal proceedings.\n\nLike every SA case, there were numerous challenges, including societal stigma surrounding sexual assault. However, I  remained steadfast in my commitment to Sara's cause, advocating for her rights in and out of the courtroom.\n\nWe got a court monitored investigation order which made the case strong from the beginning and resulted into meticulous investigation. At the time of cross-examination the defense's attempts to discredit Sarah's testimony failed miserably. As they say Truth alone triumphs. Sara stood confidently and answered all the questions(some of them being inappropriate too) of the defence.\n\nI believe knowing that she was not alone in her fight for justice made her bravely  face the legal proceedings. \n\nYesterday, the Judgement was pronounced which made my and Sara's dedication and perseverance pay off as the perpetrator was found guilty and sentenced for 20 years imprisonment. \n\nSuch type of judgements keep the flame of Justice burning. Sara finally found closure and the opportunity to begin her healing journey, empowered by unwavering advocacy and support of her family.\n\nMy takeaway is that legal battles take time but a Solid lawyer and an unwavering client with truth can get you justice.You can comment your takeaways from the above incident.

Please refer to the original post for detailed background and comments: [https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceIndia/comments/1ghvoor/made\\_1l\\_transaction\\_to\\_wrong\\_upi\\_id\\_because\\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceIndia/comments/1ghvoor/made_1l_transaction_to_wrong_upi_id_because_of/)\n\n**tl;dr:** HSBC followed the protocols, but I believe their support staff is subpar. They mislead you, causing unnecessary delays. SBI didn’t act until RBI intervened—they ignored HSBC’s request for a recall of funds and denied it, citing the unavailability of the beneficiary.\n\nAfter registering my complaint with the RBI Ombudsman in early November, the resolution process began. Here’s the sequence of events:\n\n* RBI contacted HSBC regarding the allegations and asked them to present their case through a virtual conference (VC), which included me and the RBI team. This occurred in late November.\n* RBI concluded that HSBC followed the protocol to recover the money and was not responsible for the remitter’s negligence.\n* They further instructed HSBC to check the transaction logs for the two transactions made one second apart (as I claimed not to have made the second transaction). Additionally, they requested HSBC to present the initial call recording where I was allegedly assured the money would be returned within 48 hours. I haven’t received any updates on this yet.\n* RBI instructed their team to follow up with SBI and expedite the process.\n\nAfter Christmas, I started receiving calls from various SBI branches. They verified some details and informed me that the beneficiary’s account had a zero balance, and retrieving the money would take time. They also mentioned that the beneficiary withdrew the funds on the same day I made the transaction.\n\nIn late December, the beneficiary contacted me, stating that he had received my money incorrectly and wanted to return it. He requested me to write an email to his SBI branch to unblock his accounts so he could send the money via UPI. I instead asked him to return the funds through the recall of funds, that I raised earlier, by providing his consent. Later I consulted RBI, and they confirmed that receiving the money via UPI was acceptable.\n\nI am unsure how many of his accounts were blocked, as the account to which I transferred the money had a zero balance. The beneficiary also stated that he was unable to withdraw his salary.\n\nThe next day, he visited his bank, and the branch manager informed me that his account had been unblocked temporarily. The manager assured me that the beneficiary would transfer the money via UPI in the bank’s presence and provide proof to the bank. I agreed to this arrangement.\n\nEventually, the beneficiary transferred the amount (INR 100.00 short).\n\nFinally, I received my money, and I wrote an email acknowledging the resolution to all parties involved.",

While I have had okay experiences with some male docs, I have had to deal with predatory docs as well.\n\nI know how clinical examination in intimate parts is like. I have had fine experience with both male and female docs before wrt this earlier.\n\nWhere as with some male docs, there have been instances of blatant disregard for consent, privacy when it involved examination of intimate parts. Infact, it wasn't even a proper examination of the spot where tumour is located, so to say. Yet another male doc made sexual jokes (referring to me without naming me obviously) with the male nurses in the room while I lay in a vulnerable condition under local anaesthesia for a certain medical procedure.\n\nBasically, I am quite clear that whatever has happened amounts to violation of patient's dignity and modesty. What I want to know is if registering my grievance with the hospital medical superintendent automatically means escalation to legal processes.\n\nI don't have bandwidth for legal processes now. For a while, I thought I might just suck it up because I have numerous phases of my treatment left to be completed with different doctors. But then I can't continue to dread appointments with newer male docs because oncology tends to be a male dominated field. It's difficult for me to find onco's who are reputed for good outcomes and are female as well. \n\n\nPlease let me know.\n\nThanks\n\nP.S.: If you can't be kind and respectful, please refrain from responding to this post.\n\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your kind words, support and encouragement.

They said if that's the case then I should not approach the police and we got into an argument, the ngo lady then said this is what is going to happen here , we are not from any metrocity that I expected things to go smoothly and if I want to get my boyfriend arrested I should listen and do whatever the police wants , even if it means listen to their comments and tolerate their lewd looks. I said that's not a sane opinion. \n\nWhile all this was happening my landlord kept calling me to pay the rent , which I had given it to my boyfriend ( now ex) to pay him , I asked the landlord to call my ex and take it for him as it's with him and I'm busy with work, the landlord called me a while later saying my ex abused him and told him not to call that he has nothing to do with the rent , for obvious reasons the landlord was pissed and told me to pay the rent in two days or to vacate because he isn't here to hear abuses .\nMy ex isn't receiving my calls either and I got to know that he has already lawyered up.\nI unfortunately do not have money to lawyer up nor pay my rent.\n\nI have decided to let this go , as much as I understand how important it is to stand up against such things, I simply do not have the resources to do so especially the law and police system being so shitty in my city.\nI ended up shaming him on social media so the women  in my city atleast are safe from him.\nI am extremely sorry if I have let y'all down but I did try my best but it's just not possible given my current state \n\nThis is going to be my final update about this topic.",

I had been called dependant, loser, insecure, impotent and what not. She almost filed for divorce during our separation. But later returned to our place (I belive it's because she could not get along with her family). Within a month of her return, the same old shit show started. Me and my family had been accommodating of her behaviour (for a year) because her father had a heart attack, followed by colon cancer and was undergoing treatment. \n\nToday, after a heated argument she slapped me and is now blaming me for provoking her. \n\nI'm fucking done. I believe she overstepped the line.  Please suggest a course of action.\n\nEdit: \nShe is refusing to file divorce and also refusing to leave my home.

        "text": "So my colleague who is also a great friend was dating a women for 3 months and he broke up with her and she was not ready for a break up and was telling him that if you break up I ll ruin your life etc. yet he blocked for and later after a month she has put a rape case on him and he is in jail for a week now. She has no proof etc. Yet my guy is in jail. \n\nNow how to deal with this.\n\n\nUpdate: Had got a call from the station for a statement. After my statement, I asked the police how is he doing and they told me that he has been shifted to Mumbai Central jail and the women police cop is telling me to be careful while your hanging around with women or dating them. \n\nA little information about the notice he received. I don’t know much but what the cop said me is - she has written it caused her mental breakdown etc etc and has demanded 3 crores. (Poor guys family net worth is not that much). All I know is they dated for 3 months and were also intimate on both ends and she was at his place always when they were intimate. Now my brain starts to think if a guy wants to rape why would he take the women to his residential address? If it’s a rape their should be lot of resist hurt marks etc as well! Which is doubt not.\n\nMy 2 cents to men who is into dating. - never date a women who is coming from a broken family. They ll dump all their trauma to you and then you start feeling bad for the women and start helping her out and later when u try to break up they ll trap u and blackmail you. \n\n(Women from broken families don’t have anyone to stop them or guide them to the right path, they have nothing to loose and can go any extent to fuck your life up) \n\nAll this started because my colleague broke up with her stating the reason he ll be moving out of the country for masters and long distance relationship will not work out. He decided to break up right away because he saw that the relationship is going more towards seriousness within 40 50 days of knowing each other and he felt it’s not right. \n\nBut while in the relationship he did everything to her to make her feel great. Taking her out on dates, movies, beaches, hotels and talked to her all night while he had to come the next morning. He used to say that he had 2 hours of sleep last night because he could not cut the damn phone call because she did not let him hang up. While this is a small glimpse I hope all men know that how much we do for a women to feel better and after all this u end up in central jail for breaking up with a genuine reason. \n\nNEVER DATE A WOMEN WITH BROKEN PARENTS AND NEVER SHOW COURTESY TOWARDS THEIR PAST. WOMEN WHO HAS NOTHING TO LOOSE NO ONE TO STOP CAN GO ANY HEIGHTS TO FUCK U UP BECAUSE THIS INDIAN LAW IS ONLY MADE FOR WOMEN.\n\nI am in no contact with him since his arrest. I just hope his dad can take care of him. I feel to cry placing myself in his shoes thinking about career falling apart.\nWhat is the use of living anymore when everything is shattered to pieces and all you can do is move step closer towards suicide. \n\nHe was always telling about doing something in the energy/hydrogen engineering space.

Both of their families also knew each other and marriage was about to fix. They have had physical relationships as well.\n2months back the girl gets a job in a tech company and started building relationship with one of her colleagues 24M. She started ignoring my friend, blocked from everywhere.\nMy friend sensed something is going on and spoke with the girls brother 19M. Then her brother shared a video recording of chats of Instagram of her sister (Her sister's laptop was with him and she was logged in to Instagram in her laptop). After knowing this my friend broke up with her and when the discussions are going on the other bf came and he told everything. My friend has helped her financially and mentally since last 3 years and tried for suicide as well. But now he is well and kept his distant from girl.\nBoth the families spoke and my friends side clearly told that they can't get their son married because she cheated. Her parents requested for forgiveness which my friend's family didn't accept.\n2days back the girls mother sent a message to my friends mother ( a suicide note). In that the girl had clearly mentioned that she did the mistake and now she found out the 2nd bf was in a live-in relationship with another girl and he was just playing with her. So she attempted for suicide. After knowing this my friend sent one of close friend to the girls hostel, who took her to the hospital. The girl has taken 30 tablets. By the time the girls family came, she was well taken care of and all bills are paid. ( the girls family is very poor and didn't even have money to pay the hospital bill or hostel charges) my friend took care of everything \n\nNow the girls family is trying to blackmail my friend to marry their daughter ( on the pretext of marraige he kept physical relationship). They are threatening if my friend does not marry then they will file a rape case on my friend and send him to the jail. \n\nMy friends is now totally frustrated and is telling it's better to die than go the jail.\n\nNote: in suicide note , she mentioned good things about my friend and how he helped and how his love was true for her. Also mentioned about the other bf how he played with her.\nI am sure if the other bf would have been there then would have not tried to suicide or family would not have blackmailed. They just want to remove the burden from their head by doing this. My friend father is a rich person and he does not want to talk with the girls family. As he has a huge respect and never bowed his head. So he is telling if my son did wrong then let him go to jail I will fight in court but I will never speak with the girls family or compromise.\n\nNow I need suggestions for this case. How my friend can come out of this. And if the girl goes to the police station do police directly register the case or ask any questions before registering the FIR",

I recently had a case that deeply affected me, involving a young man falsely accused of rape.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nMy client, let's call him Sahil, was a bright and promising college student. He had a clean record and a reputation for being a respectful and responsible young man among his classmates. However, his life was turned upside down when a classmate accused him of sexual assault.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI initially thought that the boy was lying but he had whatsapp chats and recordings which showed that the case was false. The girl played on the past consensual relationship she had with the boy and had an FIR registered against the boy.\r  \n\r  \nAs happens in most of the cases, Sahil's reputation was tarnished, and he faced the very real possibility of spending years in prison for a crime he didn't commit. Being a close witness to such cases, I can say that the emotional toll it took on him and his family was immeasurable. His friend circle was broken, he was left all alone. Even the parents were ashamed of the boy and thrashed him badly.\r  \n\r  \nWe gathered some more documentary evidence through Court and successfully got an anticipatory bail for the boy and I hope the trial and the pain ends soon providing justice to Sahil.\r  \n\r  \nAs I reflect on this case, I am reminded of the importance of due process and the presumption of innocence. False accusations of rape not only have the potential to destroy the lives of the accused but also undermine the credibility of genuine victims.  \n\n\nOriginally posted on r/JusticeforIndianMen",

        "text": "I am from Maharashtra and I had an arranged marriage a few months ago. My wife is very simple, which is something I wanted because I am the same. On our first night together, we had sex, and she seemed quite experienced, which made me suspect she might not be a virgin (though I have no issue with her virginity or any past relationships). The next day, I asked if she had ever had a boyfriend. She started crying and said she had never been involved in that way. I felt bad for asking and decided to move on. I even told her I was okay with her having guy friends and that I trusted her completely.\n\nHowever, about a month later, I noticed she was frequently chatting with someone and became very protective of her phone. She seemed scared if I tried to touch it. I once saw a message from her friend that seemed suspicious, but I can't remember the exact details. She also started deleting old messages and now uses auto-delete on WhatsApp. I decided to ignore it, thinking I needed more concrete evidence.\n\nFew days ago, I saw a message on Instagram from another guy. She told him she didn't like living in my home and felt like a maid. The guy insulted me lightly in Hindi, and she didn't defend me, which hurt a lot because I have always supported her. I wanted to take a screenshot but couldn’t because she was right there. Next day, I checked her Instagram again, but all the messages were deleted. However, he had sent her some reels: one was a comedy about a girl talking to her boyfriend even after marriage, and the second was a romantic, intimate hug.\n\nAfter that, I decided to spy on her mobile. I logged into her Instagram account on my phone by using the forgot password option. While keeping an eye on her Instagram chats, I saw her message him asking for a video call. After the call, she told him she missed and loved him, and he replied the same. I took snapshots of all those messages. She somehow found out I was spying on her Instagram and realized her account was also logged in on my phone, so she changed her password. Now she knows I’m spying on her and probably suspects I know everything.\n\nI am trying to stay calm and not let her know that I am aware of her actions. I can’t confront her directly right now because we live alone in the city while our parents are in our hometown. If I confront her, she might harm herself, which I am concerned about. I don’t know what to do.\n\nI am thinking of divorce, but it will impact everyone, including my family, who are part of our society. I need help figuring out how to confront her. I might be willing to give her another chance, but I am not sure if she will be loyal in the future. She is very clever and lies convincingly, making it hard for me to catch her. I also want to teach her a lesson at least.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nUpdate: I have confronted her, and she admitted that she still has a relationship with her boyfriend and has had multiple physical encounters with him. I packed her bag and took her to her family. There might be a meeting today to discuss everything. I am still not sure what to do. She is a very fake person, but I am scared of divorce and the court system.\n\nNote: I received a lot of messages over the past few days. I am really sorry I didn't reply. I am going through a lot and not using my phone that much.\n\n",

A couple of months back, I hooked up w this dude I met at a party, he was a senior (idk him personally) while we were at it, and all of a sudden a saw his phone flash turn on and I had tried to stop him from recording, he didn't I started to cry etc and he said he had deleted the video, I hung out w him a bit sneakily checked his phone couldn't find my video and I never spoke to him again until he started to bother all my friends esp male friends. However, weeks later I heard rumours of a sex tape on me and a bit later his own girlfriend came and told me that he's been showing that video to people. I initially thought she's lying,  probably was in denial that this was happening. Now a little while back, he did show that video ON FULL VOLUME to an entire group of people at a tea stall in front of me and I couldn't do shit. This is starting to get to me, esp because people already call me a slut coz I used to hook up etc and this guy has connections with some very dangerous people near our college and everyone is very scared of him. \nThe only proof I have is the video (because in the video you can hear me crying and telling him to stop recording) and I have a voice recording of his girlfriend telling me. Any advice? My college would not care and instead blame it on me.\n\nEdit: This was the only place, where I thought I could find a solution to this, (apart from going to the cops). Also, I never used this account much apart from what so many people pointed out on my profile. I no way advocated a certain way of lifestyle, I know I made mistakes and put myself in that situation, but isn't that how people end up asking legal advice, I mean you won't find people asking how to get a DL here.\nAlso, all of these things came up months after we hooked up. \nTo the people pointing out that I brought myself into this, would you say that to your homie if he got falsely accused of rape? I can't and don't have the energy to sit and argue and read all those comments but a lot of people like you aren't wondering whatabouts of the guy.",

Unfortunately, I was unable to meet him before he passed away. I was devastated, overwhelmed with grief, and heartbroken that I couldn’t say my final goodbyes.\n\nAfter the cremation ceremony, my father’s phone rang. When I answered it, it was a credit card collection agent, informing me of a debt of ₹3.5 lakhs that no one in the family knew about. Soon after, I received another call from a person who said my father had borrowed ₹1 lakh from him and never returned it, and now I was expected to pay it back.\n\nTrying to process all of this, I told my mother. She reassured me that she had savings of around ₹3 lakhs in her bank account, but when we checked, we discovered that my father had withdrawn all the money. To add to our shock, we realized her jewelry was also missing. Calls kept pouring in from various people, informing us about my father’s debts. They provided call recordings and bank statements, proving these transactions. It was all too much to take in.\n\nWe thought at least we had our home, which we could sell to settle some of the debt. But the biggest blow came when we found out he had sold our house three months ago and was living off the rent without telling anyone.\n\nI tried to trace these transactions, but everything appeared as cash withdrawals from ATMs. When I spoke to his friends, I learned that he had been deeply addicted to alcohol and gambling—specifically, stock market F&O and Teen Patti.\n\nI knew he drank, but I had no idea it was to this extent.\n\nIn just one week, I went from grieving the loss of my father to hating him. He deserves to rot in hell for what he has put us through.",

We went through this torture for more than 2 years and we couldn't take it anymore so we decided to move away from that place. When  I tried to question him openly, he threatened to cut our cable, internet and electric wires, because they pass in front of his home. I have taken photos of him blocking the entire way and sitting  shirtless in the passage way.\n\n \n\nAfter a week of moving to new place I went to Govindrajnagar police station to file a complaint against him but the police are not ready to take my complaint.\n\n\n\nFirst they asked me to come another time and when I reached there they had called this person and said please adjust and resolve it yourself. First of all they wanted me to 'adjust' with this person who had been molesting me for 2 years. I said no and wanted to move forward with the complaint. Then they said come back next week to meet the SP. I came back and then the constable had called the molester as well. He said sorry and that he won't do it again and to not give the complaint. I said I still wanted to move forward with the complaint. Then the guy suddenly said , okay then I'll also give a complaint saying you molested my wife. The constable said , if he gives a complaint then I'll have to confiscate your visa, you will lose your job and you'll have to go to jail unnecessarily, so please take the complaint back\n\n\n\nI have no clue what to do now. Can anyone please help. I know they have absolutely no case. But the police just joined hands with this person. \n\n\n\nAnd everytime I go to the station this person is already there.

        "text": "30 M India here. My wife has had a history of long distance affairs. We have been married for 2 years, no kids, and before our marriage and for almost a year after our marriage, she was texting and calling her ex boyfriend romantically, and lying to me that he was just a friend now. She blocked him twice after our arguments, and then third time, I told her mom and she blocked him for good. I have chat screen recordings from her phone of most of her chats, in which they also discussed having a child together. I have some call recordings as well, where we fought, and she even suggested me to get a girlfriend too.\nThen quite recently, in July last year actually, she started going to a Zumba class. Since a few months, she was chatting quite a lot with her instructor, but she would hush me saying he's just a good friend whenever I asked about it.\nA few days ago, I discovered they are having a full on affair, they might have even got physical, not sure at the moment. I have chat screenshots where they talk about their relationship and having an affair.\n\nNow, I want to divorce her. I have no greed for her jewellery or anything financial she has, she can have it all. In fact, I have been paying her 10k monthly for almost a year now, but I don't want that back either, or the new iPhone that she bought with that money. I just want her gone, even if I have to pay one time alimony or any decent settlement. \n\nI love her family to be honest, and I did not disclose it to anybody because I did not want to put them through this. I will also always take care of her parents and her brother like they are my own, because I love them. \n\nIn terms of my financial obligations, I earn around 1.5 lacs per month, I have a plot under my name with a house being constructed on it, there's a loan as well on both of them. I have around 3-5 lacs in savings like Mutual Fund, PPF and Pension Fund.\n\nPlease advise me how to proceed.\n\nEdit #1 : Thank you so much everyone for all the support and care. I have been bottling it for weeks now, and it was poisoning me. I can't express in words how much it means to me!!\n\nEdit #2 : Someone asked if there were any red flags I noticed earlier, in case there was anything to learn. Yes there were, and nothing would make me happier than the fact that my misfortune could be someone's treasure. I have posted in a comment, but I am posting again for everyone.\n\nSign 1 : She refused to let go of her ex boyfriend even after our marriage was fixed, kept talking about how much she loved him, kept chatting with him. Kept crying about how much it hurt her when she found out that he has been dating other girls online as well.\n\nSign 2 : She outright asked me to break the marriage arrangement whenever we had a fight. She apologized later but doesn't matter.\n\nSign 3 : She was desparate for attention, she wanted me to talk to her 2-3 hours a day continuously, even my work and office did not matter to her. It is still the same.\n\nSign 4 : She kept asking me to promise her I will never cheat on her, time and again, as if she was projecting her flaw on me.\n\nSign 5 : She was extremely jealous of me even looking at another woman, even if they were work colleagues, or mentors or anyone else. She would immediately jump to the conclusion that I am cheating on her with them.\n\nSign 6 : She kept threatening me that she will one day disappear or do something to herself. One night she said she was going to leave her house alone forever, I believed her at the time, and begged her not to leave, worrying what would happen to her family.\n\nSign 7 : She has a friend who is married and still keeps in touch with her ex without her husband's knowledge. My wife has often tried to justify her behaviour in the name of love.",

The passers by, on the day of accident, had nabbed the driver and taken pictures of him and bike. We have identified the driver (name).\n\nWe have lodged an FIR with the police but there was no mention of the bike driver in the FIR. The particular section in the report was left as ‘unknown’ despite the police themselves nabbing that guy at the time of the accident. Only the bike number is mentioned in the report. Not sure if this was intentional by the police and whether they may have been bribed to leave out the name.\n\nThe total hospital bill came upwards of 7L compounded with the traumatic loss of my father. We have talked to a few lawyers who have assured that we may get justice (in form of compensation). However, I have read from a few Reddit posts of similar situations where the lawyer themselves were bribed to turn the case. Now I am not sure if we would be served justice and don’t know if anyone can be trusted at all. Wanted to check how probable it is to win justice in such cases (accidents resulting in death)?\n\nP.S.- I do not care about the compensation since the greatest loss we are bearing (loss of life) cannot be compensated now. However, there should be some accountability for this accident which had landed our family in such a terrible situation.\n\nLocation of the accident was Noida",

        "text": "My younger brother (21) ran away with a married girl (20). They had an affair for the past 4 5 years but as they are from the same village they could not get married. After 10 days time the police caught and brought them back to the police station. At that time the girl gave the statement that she ran away with her consent and there was no mistake of the boy(my brother) The police took both their signatures on that statement and sent them both to their respective parents home. We tried to take a photo or Xerox of that statement but the police said it is not allowed to do so. Now after 15 days of giving that statement that girl has filled a rape case against my brother including kidnapping, intimidation. As the girls family is wealthy I am suspecting police are also cooperating with them. Could you guys please suggest some good courses of action. Thank you.",

        "title": "Girl I met through my uncle for Arranged Marriage threatening to file a case after refusal to marry (Karnataka)",
        "text": "I (29M, from Udupi Karnataka & working in USA) met this girl (25F, from Udupi Karnataka) via an arranged marriage setup from my uncle last month. She was matching all my preferences and we had been talking for over 6 months. It was almost too good to be true. I was happy and we were moving in the right direction so upon being asked I told her I would be willing to look at the possibility of marriage. Since the beginning she had maintained a traditional posture and only had girls as her friends. She wasn't very educated but I had no issues since she was willing to relocate with me to USA. Last month I found out that she isn't as simple as she seemed. I came to India to meet her and we met twice. Due to pure luck,, I found out that she had been attending some classes to \"trap a rich US based guy\". \n\nAlong with my younger sister I tried to find out the truth about these covert classes. She roped in a friend and I paid for a few classes. They taught everything from \"cleaning up social media\" to maintaining a \"traditional image\" in front of guys. To my utter shock there were girls as young as 19-20 yrs old attending those classes while biking away with their boyfriends after the so called \"image cleaning\" classes. Anyway, the girl I was seeing seemed to have followed the instructions to the dot and now I wasn't even sure who the hell was I courting. Strangely enough, despite being so \"naive\" and a \"crybaby\" she actually had the smartness to dig up a very hidden conference video of mine given by me a long time back representing my older company. She knew everything about me that was available online. Almost seemed like someone else had dug it up for her as part of bg check or something. So this dummy friend that we had sent to the \"marriage classes\" told us how the girls are taught to hide stuff about their medical conditions, past, family history of mental illnesses and even the fact that they have/had \"guy-friends\". Personally I have no issues with any of these factors & I m only looking for a genuine person. Most girls attending those classes seemed to have come from broken families n it's quite common in my culture for people to have bad/abusive marriages so I had no issue with that but it made me mad how they used this fact to leverage their life. \n\nThe girl I was seeing seemed to have no qualms in setting abroad with me leaving her mother alone in India despite being an only child. But my egoistic mind at the time allowed me to believe she was smitten by me only to later on come to know that I was just a \"prey\" who fell for this bullshit too easy. \n\nBy now I was convinced after giving a good number of days on this investigation that everything about the girl was fake. Even though our extended families knew each other since decades, no one was aware of her true self. Once a long time back on a VC I had noticed a very small moisturizer bottle kept in the background that belonged to a famous five star hotel chain that my company is tied up with. I had asked if she had ever been there and she dismissed saying it was just something she got from a friend. At that time I obviously didn't pay much attention as it was a small thing. Now something just ticked me and luckily I have a very close school friend working for that hotel chain who I asked to simply check if there is an identity of her in their database. Yes, I am aware that's not right and he didn't retrieve any data for me but did inform that her ID existed in their database. He didn't tell me her booking details (not sure if he didn't have access or didn't want to risk). I know what I did was horribly wrong but I was desperate to find out. I asked her in different ways if she had been to Bangalore for probably a wedding or some event or anything at all but she refused having been to Bangalore anytime in the last one decade. I confronted her about attending those \"marriage classes\" and she outright denied saying those were just \"cooking classes so she could prepare my favorite dishes\" LOL. I discovered that her mother was a schizophrenic (this was hidden from me) but she still claimed that she had told me. \n\nFinally, I told her that I was not interested in marrying her and hell broke loose.\n\nNote: I SWEAR I had NO physical relationship with her of ANY kind. She threatened to file a case of fraud and refusal to marry on me and my family.  She spread lies in her side of the family saying I tried to forcefully kiss her and get physical when we had first met in person. This is not true at all. I wish we had met at a proper hotel where there were CCTV cameras to prove the same but we rather met on a beachside so there is no proof of my innocence. Yesterday, a family relative of hers, a police inspector marched into my house and confiscated my passport threatening to put me in jail. \nNow, a number of our mutual relatives are whispering that I am this perverted guy who only is trapping simple girls from their hometown. I will get my passport back today but I can't leave the country as I am worried for what they will do to my family and besides they have threatened to lodge FIR. \n\nWhat should I do guys??\n\nOFF-TOPIC- I was in a relationship some years back with a beautiful kind girl for 2 years but we broke up because she wanted marriage and I was willing to marry only someone from my home state.  Something tells me this is Karma for me as she was there for me always and breaking her heart probably made me face this situation today. I at least was lucky enough to have been loved by her and having known her well I know she had all the qualities. \n\nThe current experience has left me scared to death about Arranged Marriages. What should I do guys?? Any good recommendations for lawyers here??\n\nUPDATE: Thankfully, I got my passport back after a lot of trouble today. The girl's cop relative handed over the passport to her and pretended like he never forcefully took it. I have received a lot of help on this portal. Will update more as and when things progress guys and respond to queries.",

        "text": "I have been married since past 3 years. It was an arranged marriage. Me and my spouse are living in a rented accommodation for now. I don't mind paying the rent and the house is decent.\n\nMy wife and in-laws have started pressurising me to purchase a property. Their opinion is that property is a must and they want it for the security of future generation. \n\nI tried explaining why I wasn't interested in buying the property right away and have decided to purchase it two years later. This resulted in a big marital discord and we temporarily separated for a couple of months. We finally reached an agreement after keeping both the families in loop that I would purchase a property after 1 year from now. \n\nWe started staying together about a month ago and my wife said she won't bring this topic until one year. However, within one week, she started throwing tantrums and started asking me when I am going to purchase a property. \n\nI have repeatedly told her that I need at least a year to purchase a property. But, she never listened to me and is very adamant on the demand. Lately, she told me that she won't have any physical contact with me until I buy a property. \n\nI have tried explaining her how I am trying to create multiple sources of income for our future but it has gone in vain. I am a bit unclear on whether denying physical intimacy in exchange of property is the right thing to do to any person. \n\nFrom the beginning of marriage, we have been staying separately from my parents. However, now she says she wants to stay in my parent's house as that is her matrimonial house. Also, she doesn't share good relationship with my mother and I advised her not to visit my parent's place since she creates a huge ruckus wherever she goes. She threatened me that she will call the police and tell them that my parents are not allowing her to enter her matrimonial house.\n\nHer behaviour caused lot of emotional pain to me initially. But in the past one month, I have been very mindful of the way she is gaslighting me and avoided any long explanations. Instead, I just give one-liner replies and reply either yes, no or I don't know. This has protected my mental health and I feel slightly better now.\n\nI wanted some advice on how should i take the relationship forward and how can I safeguard my parents (forget me) legally in such matter. I know that laws are heavily biased towards women and I don't have any hopes from the judiciary as well. Even if I record the conversation, they will throw me behind the bars for breaching someone else's privacy. Is there a ray of hope here ?",

        "text": "My family met a girl through the arranged marriage process for my brother. We met her only twice—once when my parents met her and her family, and the second time when my brother and I were present as well. However, my brother didn’t like her and decided to reject the proposal.  \n\nThere was almost a month-long gap between these two meetings due to unforeseen events. During this time, my brother and the girl spoke on the phone maybe twice and exchanged only a few text messages. He was never interested in the proposal, but since my parents liked her, they wanted him to meet her once, which he did.  \n\nThe girl’s family was informed about a week ago that we would not be proceeding with the proposal. As soon as they received the news, the girl and her father started calling us repeatedly. The girl wanted my brother to reconsider because she had become \"attached\" to him and wanted to marry him. However, my brother firmly told her that it wouldn’t be the right decision and that they couldn't move forward. It took her some time to accept the rejection, but eventually, she did.\n\nThe issue now is with her father. He hasn’t stopped calling my dad since they got the news. My dad doesn’t answer because he felt bad rejecting a \"nice\" family, but at the same time, he knows there’s no point in discussing it further, as my brother’s decision is final.  \n\nToday, we found out that the girl’s father had already informed the people in his \"community\" that his daughter was going to get married. Apparently, in their community, once a girl is introduced to a potential match, it means the arrangement is final. He also mentioned that his daughter has refused to consider any other matches and has threatened to commit suicide if she doesn’t marry my brother?? Wtf\n\nI just want to know if they can file any legal case against us. Thank you ",

I looked into her case file and while talking to her I asked her and found out:\n\n1. She was married at 12 years of age or before that\n\n\n2. She has no age verification document (meaning she could be below 18)\n {for the note: everyone getting admitted in hospital mostly has age Verifying govt document} I suspect that she doesn't have age verifying document because she isn't actually 18, but her husband faked her age to avoid legal liabilities. \n(Because she had a child at 13 but her kid is apparently 3 years old, which doesn't make any sense cuz she's 18) \n\n\n3. Her husband is 20 years older than her or more ( at least that's what she said, but when I saw her husband he appeared to be in his 50s) \n\n4.

Her husband doesn't allow her to work in handicrafts or continue her education in any way fearing she'll \"fall in love with someone else and run away\".\n\n7.Additionally the main reason why she was not allowed to leave hospital was because, She's suicidal and has uncountable scars from SH. \n\n\nHow can I help her? \n(The incharge can't help her, because apparently \"we gwt people like them every now and then but we can't possibly help them all\" And its not worth it) \n\nEDIT: \nI'LL LIKE TO ADD A FEW ADDITIONAL INFO\n\n1. She's from a muslim community. \n\n2. Her husband might actually come tomorrow if I report to police, and if he gets the chance, he'll actually kill her. \n\n3.

Now in our family none of us had any idea/clue about this dual personality of his, all i know is through the chats i saw on his phone, he doesn't know we know about it yet. In july he met this girl online who told him how she made a fortune by trading in forex markets. She somehow convinced him to invest and that she'll become his mentor and make him rich. My grandfather lost about 12 lakhs to a scam call in 2022 and has been guilty ever since so he thought he'll recover that money. She sent her a site which i know is totally fake and He intially deposited 40K inr and traded with it, the money was deposited in random accounts in which a fake customer care of that site asked him to deposit, they asked for investments in different accounts everytime. Within the next 15 days he invested almost 3.5 Lakhs. She used to flirt with him and convinced him of doing all this🤡. He withdrew $51(4080 inr) and thought that all the investments he made were legit and kept on investing more. In the next one month he invested another 10.5L(total 14L so far).\n\nNow in late august, according to the site, he had made approx $119000(roughly 1cr). When he tried to withdraw his money, the customer care said that to withdraw he needs to pay a tax of roughly 24 Lakhs. He asked them to deduct it from his profit but they said they can't deduct from a customers account and he needs to deposit that money. He went to the bank and sent the payment via RTGS. After this when he tried to withdraw, they asked for a foreign exchange fees and asked for another 8 lakhs. He with his closed mind (idk man what was going on in his head, im just ashamed of him atp) made that tranfer. This time after trying for withdrawal, they asked him for some other bs taxes worth 29 LAKHS. Now all the money he had was used and his bank was empty. Now you'll think a person in his right mind would stop, BUT NO. He broke some FD and withdrew 29 Lakhs. This is when my father got to know that an fd had been broken. He asked him what are you gonna do with that much amount and what happened to all the money you had. He just made some excuse which idk about(will probably post it in an edit), he asked him to stop and NOT INVEST WITHOUT CONSULTING HIM STRICTLY, he agreed to it with him but then made the deposit later that day🤡🤡(papa was out of town). I on a random went through his phone after this and got to know about all this blunder he had done, all the transactions were made to random accounts and the site he using was based on nginx and was basically a scam. After this when he tried to withdraw, they asked for another 14Lakhs taxes. The girl who used to guide him is saying ki just pay 5.6 lakhs and she'll pay the remaining. She is still active and in touch with him.  I told about all this to my parents and they have STRICTLY WARNED him to not make any transaction. Roughy 75 Lakhs have been lost so far and we can't even go to the police because all the online chats he has with girls🤡🤡, its just so shameful we cant even tell anyone. All out life savings are gone just like that. All of us are just blank atp and ashamed of this foolery. I am unable to sleep and so are my parents, grandmother does not know about all this.\n\nI know its all his fault and we've accepted that none of it will come back but still if someone can help, it'll do us a HUGE favour. We have nothing left now, all our savings and emergency funds are gone and we have nothing left🤡🤡. Will add more details in edit when i remember\n\nEDIT 1 --> He cleared all his chats with the girls after my father confronted him, only proofs that are available are the messages with the customer care(online scammer) of that so called website and the accounts given by him to make the transactions\n\nEDIT 2 --> I think im just helpless atp, can't file complaint cz parents said GF would have to confess which he wont. 2022 m 1-2 ghante baad hi complaint krdi thi ek penny wapas nahi ayi, ab toh 10 din hogye kya hi hoga. I dont think anything can be done now, they aren't allowing me to file a complaint. ig i should just accept it now and move on. Thank you for the help\n\nEDIT 3 --> I've mailed a bunch of youtubers who expose call centers/scammers online. This was all i could do in my power(im 17m after all). I know everyone has asked me to file a complaint but try to understand im helpless Its not about embarassment, more about the fact that my grandfather just wont admit and we are worried if he takes some serious step then we all will be blamed+ nothing happened last time(oct 2022) thats why parents believe police is worthless, we even wrote a letter to the pm last time, all in vain. There is a reason for their mind set",

        "title": "URGENT: Sexual video recording leaked online.",
        "text": "**Location**: Haryana, India**My age**: 23**Event**: My sister's first boyfriend recorded her video on WhatsApp in 2018-19 where she was showing her private parts. Using those videos and pictures, 5-6 boys blackmailed her to do sexual favours. We learned all about this, with her that time boyfriend (now her ex), and that something like this happened in 2021. She was so traumatised and she even tried to take her life. She was not mentally ready to go to the police and report this incident. This is what assumed looking at her situation. I tried to convince my parents to go to the police and report this but, they hesitated and they were so confused about what to do and we ended up doing nothing. She needed therapy and we did that. Now, those boys are not contacting her. But, her ex (the one who told us everything) was so madly in love with her and wanted to marry her. But, my sister was having her mental problems. The ex was not understandable. Till this point, she was having issues of PTSD, Borderline personality disorder (BPD), depression, anxiety, and suicide and she even cut her arm with the blade but those were not deep. So, she left her and then, after some time, she went back to him due to BPD but it ended up bad. Her ex tricked her into coming to some place and he mentioned that he had her videos and he had talked with her friends and blamed her for ruining her life and his too. She was shattered and she had an episode, where she lost her memory completely. She only remembered till class 9th. Her ex and his cousins, threatened us that time, that they would take my sister away. We spent almost 2 weeks at our aunt's house and his family members used to stalk our house. Now, this all thing happened in April last year. Some days ago, I found my sister's video on one of the porn sites and it was uploaded in April last year. Her ex must be behind this. Her ex tried to contact her recently (maybe because of Valentine's Day)  using someone who's in her batch. The site doesn't have a report button. I am unable to find the source of the video. I didn't tell my parents and her. She's still having issues and her therapist told us clearly, that we have to be vigilant of her. So, I cannot tell her anything and my mother is having depression issues. My father is almost at work. This will be very impactful for them. I was about to register the complaint on the cybercrime.gov.in website. But, I didn't. She's having her semester exam and her BPD symptoms have arisen.Please, help me. How can I take down the video and make sure, the person who uploaded it gets arrested? I don't want to involve my family in this. They still are having a hard time.\n\nEdit: \nThank you for the support everyone. \nI learn a lot of new things. I'll definitely convince my parents to do something about this and if they didn't, I'll take the matter into my hands.\nAll new suggestions are welcome.\nI don't want a single loophole to be present.\n",

        "text": "Supreme Court Awards ₹2 Crore Permanent Alimony To Estranged Wife Towards \"Decent Standard Of Living\"\n\nCASE: \n\n▪️This was wife's second marriage. She had received ₹40 Lakh in alimony from first husband as well\n\n▪️Her second marriage did not last beyond a year & parties had been living separately since nine years\n\n▪️Since there was no scope of parties co-habiting together again, Supreme Court dissolved the marriage under Article 142 of the Constitution\n\n▪️Husband works as a VP with a bank with a net income of ₹5 Lakh per month \n\n▪️Estranged Wife's current income is ₹1.39 Lakh per month, while she claimed her monthly expenses to be ₹4 Lakh per month, besides ₹75,000 per month for minor daughter (from first marriage)\n\nSUPREME COURT \n\n▪️A bench of Justices Vikram Nath & Prashant Kumar Mishra said:\n\n\"This court is of the opinion that the demand made by the appellant is exceptionally high, but, at the same time, the amount offered by the respondent is insufficient in the broader rubric of maintenance considerations.\"\n\nThe court thus fixed one-time settlement amount of Rs 2 crore as fair and balanced for permanent alimony to be paid by the husband within four months to cover all pending and future claims, keeping in view the totality of the circumstances, the social and financial status of the parties, their current employments as well as future prospects, standards of living, and their obligations, liabilities, and other expenses.\n\nVOICE FOR MEN (Twitter) INDIA TAKE \n\n▪️This is exactly the alimony payouts we are against\n\n▪️Why should a working woman whose marriage did not last even for a year get any alimony?\n\n▪️After wasting 9-years in lower and high courts, if husbands are anyways expected to pay permanent alimony in the name of \"financial security of estranged wife\", why is this amount not fixed on day 1 itself?\n\n▪️Why should husbands spend years of prime life & money on lawyers, if in the end it has to be #HePays \n\n▪️The alimony is granted based on the current income of the husband, while estranged wife has zero contribution in his life since 9-years\n\nOP's Take : Alimony should be given to wife on basis of duration of marriage. If marriage didn't last long for more than a year then why husband was asked to pay 2 crore.

        "title": "Update: Roommate was R@ped",
        "text": "Hi, First of all I would like to thank you all for your supporting and kind responses and secondary, sorry for not replying to anyone. A lot happened after I made the post but I won't go into much and every details as it is also difficult for me to share this. And please don't be judgemental or hateful towars me as I didn't had any wrong intention and made the post with genuine reasons. Below points will summarise the entire story-\n\nMy roommate= girl, Roommate's brother=bro, Roommate boyfriend=guy/bf.\n\n1. As I went of town, girl and guy had plan to spend time together alone in house. (She didn't told me that her bf would come in my absence before I left cause I would have been against it cause aunties create scene and complaint to landlord and families.)\n\n2. Her friends planned series of events to go to restraunt, theatre, pub and invited her to join. She ditched the bf and  went to friends. Bf pissed and told her to cancel but she denied.\n\n3. After pub she called bf to take her home and she will make up for lost time (with sex) as I was coming next day afternoon and they still would have enough time to enjoy.\n\n4. He agreed, picked her up at pub, took her home, they had sex. Then bf and girl had fight and disagreement, reasons- she ditched and also others things in their relationship and resulting into guy breaking up with her.\n\n5. The bite and some hitting marks (light red) on her body were for two reasons - a) they both are kinky in bed, which I knew before cause of girl talk, b) she maybe made some extra by herself for showoff \n\n7. After I made post I called her brother(without telling her), whom I knew is a good understanding guy cause she wasn't communicating with me properly and not taking any action. Didn't tell him anything but said it's important, urgent and she needs him.\n\n8. When her brother came she gave me really angry and hateful look but I still told her to tell her brother or I will. They had talk alone and brother took her to police station with teary and angry eyes. I went too without being asked specifically.\n\n9. At police station she told same story she told me but replaced stranger with bf coming forcefully with knife. I was shocked but thought she wasn't comfortable telling me cause I didn't like her boyfriend so I could be judgemental. \n\n10. Police called bf to come station urgently, before and without writing complaint.\n\n11. When he came,he  heard the allegations, got abused and almost hit by brother and was pale, teary and dumbfounded. Girl stayed silent entire time with her head down and hiding.\n\n12. Bf then took out his phone and showed call recording of girl telling to pick up and take her home and have sex and chats of planning their time together when I leave.\n\n13. Girl then started crying and said he is lying and it's fake, but when officer asked for her phone to check chats and call log      she got silent and turned pale.\n\n14. Then guy told the entire truth (which I mentioned from point 1 to point 5). After hearing all that, I left the police station after telling the brother I'm leaving cause it was all too much for me and I was at freaking police station for her for so long.\n\n15. Only other thing I know is brother has taken the girl to parent's house coming back home for packing stuff. I didn't asked anything cause I didn't want to embarrass him more or make environment uncomfortable but he thanked me and told me that matter is sorted and they are going to parents.\n\nAgain, sorry for making this update post little late as I was both afraid and ashamed to share all this cause I feel guilty too. The girl isn't exactly my much of a friend but roommate cause I knew she was kind of toxic and manipulative so I maintaned safe distance with her.\n\nThank You.\n\nEdit - A lot of people are saying that I was wrong to call her brother and I agree they are right from their POV but only because there was no actual rape and on assumption that she wouldn't have filled complaint if not because of me. But what I didn't mention is that I come from lawyer, police family background (but have no knowledge of these profession) and that's why she asked me what would be the effect of filing complaint and that's why I made the post. For me, my roommate told me that she was r@ped violently where I live at knife point, and then stopped communicating with me. I couldn't tell what was going in her mind, what if she falls into depression and the people get to know at late or attempt suicide or cut, harms her skin, body etc. I was also traumatized, scared and panicked and contracted her brother cause I knew he is understanding and level headed guy and it was a freaking rape on her sister. I was fine and supportive of her in case she choose not to file complaint but took things into my hand cause she stopped much talking and behaving wierdly which seemed dangerous and concerning in my head. \n\nPeople saying I'm controlling of her choice of boyfriend, I'm not, I'm controlling when some male stays at our mutual rented place cause as girl I live in society where people shame your character when guys come and overnight or any other time. I have got in trouble before for same reason because of her but got it sorted cause not my bf. \n\nAnd at last people saying it's fake, I wish it was.",

He didn't even pay a single visit with me clinics n started to act like a victim saying I seduced him into it n that's why it's my responsibility that I became pregnant. Immature person always blaming every shit in his life on me.\n\nI had to do everything alone coz I couldn't get family or friends involved. He never even proposed to marry me. I just asked my bf to help me through this but he instead pretended falling sick himself. Then he started to remote control the situation over calls n msgs. \n\nSuddenly he suggested coming over to take care of me when I said I want to think over my options with the baby. I soon discovered he only wanted to get rid of me. He made me forcibly drink shakes of raw papaya and mentally harassed me a lot. I can write details of how he caused this miscarriage if any specific questions. \n\nUnder his supervision I got very sick. After 3 days I started bleeding heavily. I visited clinic alone n doc informed me that I had miscarried. He ghosted me once he was convinced baby was no more.\n\nAfter my recent checkup with another gynae doc due to some ongoing issues I came to know that I have permanent complications in my body and it will  not be possible for me to conceive later. He has ripped off chances of me having a normal marriage/relationship with anyone in future. He threatened me not to tell anyone about all this ever. I want to make sure he is put in jail and rots there for his pre meditated crime.He threatened me several times.\n\nSometime has passed after this incident. He destroyed my medical records but I can retrieve from clinic.  \n\nWhat should I do guys? Should I talk to him? Should I confide in family first? Please suggest 🙏 \n\nEDIT : I can see that a lot of people are getting the wrong impression that I miscarried by drinking raw papaya juice.  It is just ONE of the many things that he did. It is not even be the primary cause but one of the factors that pushed this. There are several other very grave actions which he took. Also, by saying I wanted to explore my options with the baby, I meant that I clearly told him I wanted to know what was the best course of action by confiding in my known circle of doctors & friends. He cut me off from everyone and I did not get a chance to take a sound decision about the baby. Whether or not I wanted an abortion and how/where I wanted to get it done was something I was not given a chance to even think about. I was crapping and vomiting all week long due to unknown sort of food poisoning and then next I bled to the extent that I pleaded for death. This is not about papaya guys... please read the post carefully. Thanks for all the support.",

        "title": "My Ex, love of my life, filed false sexual harrasment charges. I came out clean. What action can I take when nobody seems to care? ",
        "text": "Brace yourselves for millennial drama! TL;DR in the end\n\nHello everyone! 4 years ago, my then live-in partner, filed a false sexual harassment case on me which made me run pillar to post in courts for all these years, only to see her not show up to the court at all. Finally, after four proclamations and an NBW, she shows up only to turn hostile in the box and deny her complaint. My spirit crushed right there. Here's how the story goes;\n\nThe two of us fell in love when I was 21 and she was 19. We're from Bangalore. Our relationship went on for two years before our parents found out. By then I had already materialised my brain-child of a start-up. So when confronted, my parents threatened to throw me out of the house if I chose her over them. Me being the righteous kind, said it wasn't fair on her, and obliged. At a very young age, I learnt how it feels to be dejected by your own. To make matters worse, they even had a tiff with the girl's side over the same. Succumbing to parental pressure, even the girl left her home (I wasn't notified, her eloping came out of the blue to me)\n\nBecause I already had a business up and running, I accepted her decision but we chose to live separately. She assisted me with client communication while I closed the deals and worked on projects. A year down the line, we moved into a flat, started living-in together. That's when the problems arose. She often kept stirring up inconducive conversations about how my parents had behaved with hers and how they were disturbed   and all. I kept telling her that what was important was that I was with her, away from my parents. But it gradually became a huge concern and things only went downhill then on. While I had no qualms with her going to meet her people, she made sure that I didn't reconcile with mine. She would often resort to self-sabotaging, slicing up her arm and whatnot whenever we had an argument. While I spoke as a team, she always considered me as an opponent in an argument.\n\nOne unfortunate day, I came back home only to see her pull off a gone girl. Poof! She was gone. What more, she had eloped with every single document that ever mattered to my existence. Starting from my bank cards to company documents to personal documents to vehicle documents to even the house key! \n\nNot only had I lost the one person who I fought the world for, I also had nothing to go on with. Four days later I learnt from her friend that she had been suggesting my girl to leave me for over a year, because she thought I wasn't the right match! Not only did she not return my stuff but also tried to get an equal share from my bank account because we were living-in. \n\nI was depressed, shut myself in, didn't even let my parents know, when all the while she had comfortably returned to her home. Seeing my condition deteriorate, my friends themselves informed my parents and they were once again back in my life.\n\nAfter failed pleas for a decent parting for over a month, I had to file a complaint in my local police station about my missing items. The cop was very kind to help me out with such a trivial matter. He fetched her location and sent me to retrieve my stuff only for me to realise that she had returned to her parents' native. I alone had to riskingly enter a village where I knew everybody would be hostile. It's a miracle I even made it out safe. The woman didn't budge. She kept saying everything was rightfully hers. Had to return empty handed because dare I not confront a 'woman' amongst her own people. \n\nTwo days later, the cop stepped his foot down and asked her to come down to the station along with her family. Once there, instead of responding to my complaint, she creates a hue and cry about how she's an equal shareholder and deserved to get half of my bank balance because we were in a live-in relationship. I held my ground but a few cop subordinates coerced me saying that I better give away the money otherwise she could very well press rape charges against me. I had no words. I was coerced into writing a cheque, only for me to realise that she along with her friend had forged up false documents to make the claim. \n\nMe being the righteous kind, said it wasn't done, and blocked the cheque (mind you, I blocked the cheque while maintaining sufficient balance). \n\nA month later, she slammed me with a cheque bounce case, alleging that cheque bounced due to insufficient funds. I couldn't care less. \n\nI appeared before the court and pleaded not guilty, said I'd fight it out. \n\nHer family and herself couldn't stand it at all. Parallely, they had to account for a random guy showing up at their native and also about her disappearance for two years. Us being from the same locality, they went around saying how I had married her and cheated on her, treated her the worst bla bla bla, and that they were gonna send me to prison. \n\nWhich they did, a month later. But never did they reveal to people on what charges and what case.\n\nHere's how the FIR went: \n\nThat she and I had met four years ago in some annual meet and that I had been persistently behind her since then, stalking her and forcing her to 'love me, love me'. And one fine day, I lost my shit, followed her, pulled her dupatta, outraged her modesty (a foolish attempt at bringing in IPC 354, 354A charges) and threatened her to love me or else I'd kill her entire family (IPC 506 😂Ik). \n\nThe joke of it all? I wasn't even in Bangalore on the said day!!! \n\nHere's a woman who in the beginning of the relationship had absolutely no hesitation to lie to me for sympathy points about how she was sexually abused and molested as a child!!! (women of reddit, please chime in as to whether anything can justify this!! I was too blind in love to overlook this, and had instead chosen to let go), and now she was lying through her teeth that I myself had tried to  harass her sexually.\n\nBecause she was a woman and brought in some influence, the police not only registered the complaint but also filed the FIR without any investigation. I was arrested in the night, wasn't told why, was kept in the cell overnight, was taken to the court next day. Despite it being a non-bailable offence (14-day remand a mandate), the judge saw through the truth of the matter instantly but A.P had gone home by then, it was 5pm. Unfortunately, I had to go to prison for one night (don't ask me how I came out sane. After what I saw inside, I doubt very few men can), was bailed out the next day. To my dismay, the police filed chargesheet with the only evidence in it being her statement along with her family's.\n\nCut to four years later, after countless sessions with my lawyers and in court, my fighting spirit had worn off. But since truths were by my side, although delayed, justice arrived. In both cases. \n\nI had come out clean from both the false charges (the cheque bounce and the sexual harrasment). The orders in the first stated she had miserably failed to make her case and that she had produced questionable evidences. In the second, the orders stated that she denied me ever outraging her modesty and that the incident never happened. \n\nFinally, after four years (COVID to top it off, business had fallen faceflat), I walked out of the court, spirit battered and bruised, but soul at peace, at last. \n\nMy battles are over, now is my time to salvage my life. There's absolutely no incentive for me to go back to the mess again. But me being the eccentric righteous kind, just can't get the matter out of my head. \n\nI cannot digest the fact that an individual can bring one's life to shambles with their malicious lies, all because they're from a particular gender/group. I'm not making this a man v/s woman issue. I'm making it a truth v/s lies issue. No lie should be able to reign supreme, no matter the difference is in gender, race, class, creed, age etc. \n\nI cannot stand the fact that a lie could be so loud and destructive whereas my truth when came out, came out in silence. The court acquittal orders were issued at around 3pm by a clerk in an empty court room, judge wasn't even around. Atrocities of the lies were loud, but my truth was barely a whimper.\n\nI've always believed that human suffering should amount to a difference in ways of the world. If one has suffered, he must strive to ensure someone else doesn't face the same fate. If suffering goes unquestioned, then really, what is the point of it all? Of this society? \n\nWith these thoughts in mind, I consulted my lawyers and I wanted to press more than civil defamation charges. I wanted to press criminal charges because it IS a criminal offence to file false FIRs, commit fraud and present false witnesses. My acquittal orders are already foolproof evidence to all these crimes. \n\n\nYet, yet....I have zero support. Parents brushed aside my rebuttal saying that I better not get into it again since she can come up with any cock-and-bull story. I can't even begin to explain to them how irrational their fear is. I didn't relent. Said I would take action myself with or without their help. Finally, they gave in, said that they'd press charges on my behalf as my parents and that I focus on my future.\n\nBelieving them, I moved to a new city for work and resumed my life. Now, suddenly, they're singing a different tune. That they're too old to be taking all this stress, that they tell it for my own food, and that I should let it go too.\n\nI cannot even!!!!! Now, I'm stuck in a different city, with all the trauma, and all alone! If I wanna go back and take up the matter myself, I'll jeopardize my work, and I can't trust my parents to ever stand for me. \n\nSo here I am, desolated from my homeland, dejected by my own, and destroyed by the only person I ever chose to love the most. \n\nWhat respite do I have? What action can I take? I'm no Johnny Depp, why would the world care when my own parents didn't? How can I, being thousands of miles away, even start to take legal action over this? \n\nIt's actually super easy and convenient for me to put it all behind, but I simply cannot. If my own well-to-do parents would rather disown me again than stand by me just because it's a woman on the other end, what hope does any average man in India have? What hope does truth have over lies?\n\nI need help. So that with my voice, I can help to ensure no other soul succumbs to malice in this deceitful world. That one day, I can fearlessly call out my perpetrator and encourage others to do the same.\n\nHumans of Reddit, I appeal to you. Please help! \n\nTL;DR - I left my parents for my love. \n              My love left me for her parents.\n              Her parents abetted her in framing me with false charges. \nI came out clean.\nNow my parents will neither let me fight the lie nor do they help me fight the lie. \n\nAnd I cannot let my suffering go pointless, since things REALLY need to change in this country. Old outdated laws must have no place. No woman should have unquestioned power to indict a man where he has no say. No lie should be more powerful than the truth. Help!",

        "title": "My neighbor beaten me out of ego - Malviya Nagar, New Delhi ",
        "text": "Hello everyone, here is a video that I managed to capture while my neighbor (Deepak Sharma aka Deepak Chowdhary) was beating me with a heavy stick for no valid reason.\n\nWhat actually happened: \nI stay in a rented flat in Panchsheel Vihar, Malviya Nagar, New Delhi. Deepak, along with his brother and his entire family has recently purchased a flat in the same building where I have been residing. Now they wish to get hold on the entire building and on it’s parking space. To do so, they act as goons & create hooliganism.\n\nThis entire scene started as soon as I came downstairs with my pet dog to take him for a regular walk around noon of 20th July, 2024. Deepak obstructed my way and asked me to park my car ‘tameez se’, though my car was already parked decently. Also, Deepak has a separate space dedicated to park his car, still he has been trying to provoke me to fight with him for months over parking. On this day, right after a brief dialogue which he initiated with me, he suddenly started beating me. He already planned this entire incident and this is why he had the lathi pre-arranged around that space (downstairs - he stays on 2nd floor).\n\nDuring this, I called 112 and called my brother who is a practising lawyer in Delhi. Soon after my brother arrived at the place of this incident, the PCR arrived too. However, Deepak, his brother Pradeep, his father and some of his friends (Deepak’s father is famous as Chowdhary chai wala in that area) again beaten me and my brother in front of the PCR. We were being beaten by an entire mob at that time and hence we rushed to enter in the PCR to save our lives. Then the PCR took us for medical which took almost 5 hours to get completed. We were not supposed to leave the hospital unless the medical process was completed. The police/PCR left us at the hospital.\n\nIn the evening when we were discharged from the hospital, we reached at Malviya Nagar (New Delhi) Police Station to file a written complaint about this incident. There, we got to know that a false complaint has already been filed by Deepak’s wife that we have misbehaved with her. This is an absolutely fake complaint, neither me nor my brother even touched her. We were infact struggling to save ourselves from the mob that was beating us.\n\nWhat followed next:\n1. The incident happened on 20th July and I reported the same to police on the same day. However, police refused to give me a receiving on my complaint, no FIR was filed on my complaint. In fact, police started threatening me that Deepak’s wife has also submitted her complaint that I molested her and if I will ask police to take any action against Deepak, police will arrest me for molesting his wife.\n2. I posted this incident on insta as a reel and luckily the reel went viral. Soon after that, ACP Hauz Khas intervened and assured me that appropriate action will be taken. After ACP’s intervention, FIR was filed during the late hours of 24th July. \n3. Though FIR has been filed, no further action has been taken by police yet. Neither Deepak has been arrested yet nor police has recovered the danda yet. My IO (investigating officer) hardly picks up my call. \n4. Deepak is trying to dilute the incident. Right after he beaten me, he yelled that I misbehave with his children (not true). When the matter reached to police, he said that I misbehaved with his wife (not true). And now he is telling the neighbors that I threatened his father and misbehaved with his father (not true).\n5. I am getting pressurised by locals to compromise with Deepak. \n\nFacts:\n1. This entire incident was preplanned by Deepak in advance. He pre-arranged the danda at ground floor (near the staircase), though he and his family stays on 2nd floor.\n2. He consciously chose to beat me at such a spot which isn’t covered by any CCTV. If I wouldn’t have recorded the incident myself, I would have never been able to defend myself against his wife’s fake complaint. \n3. I wasn’t beaten by Deepak after any heated argument, I was beaten because Deepak planned to beat me. That is why he obstructed my way and initiated a dialogue with me at the first place. \n4. The beat officers (policemen who regularly take rounds to ensure safety of general public) are regular visitors of Deepak’s father’s chai shop. \n5. Last year, Deepak and his brother Pradeep tried to allege me that I stole their 1.5 lacs cash that they forget after keep the cash on my car. They even got a policeman who happens to be a friend to them, to investigate this matter. Interesting part: they never filed any complaint regarding this, the policeman came just in yaari, and later Deepak’s brother and the policeman both apologised in writing for conspiring against me. \n6. Deepak’s father has a chai ki dukaan (Chowdhary chai wala) in this same area and they have been staying in the same locality for around 30+ years (before purchasing the flat, they had another property in the same locality). They are trying to ignite the influential people (localites) of the locality that I regularly misbehave with everyone and since I am a bechelor, I shall not be allowed to stay in their locality (please note that I have been staying in this flat since 2015).\n\nThis is a clear case of conspiracy where pro-female laws are being misused to defend Deepak’s act.\n\nWhat am I seeking from you?:\nI’m seeking your help to teach a life lesson to Deepak while staying within the limits of law. Today, it was me, tomorrow, it may be you or your kid. People like Deepak are a threat to the society and since such people aren’t afraid of law, they do whatever they wish to.\n\nUnfortunately, the laws in our country are a joke. If a person isn’t influential or isn’t having funds, it’s next to impossible to get timely justice. This is not just my fight against Deepak, but our collective fight for humankind against unsocial elements like Deepak and corrupt system.\n\nOn the viral reel that I posted, I got a lot of support as well as a lot of criticism. Most of the support was in the form of- Deepak ka address do, or, Deepak ka number do, hum abhi theek karte hai usko. However, this is not what I think is right. We must unite and get the system pressurised to serve justice in this case.",

        "text": "\n\nI'm a 19 year old. Since my 11th, I was diagnosed with a serious illness. I was coughing up blood and was on my deathbed for almost a year. I fully recovered in August 2024. I was saved from dying, only to be reminded daily by my family that they wish I hadn’t survived.\n\nMy Mother: My mother loves wearing the mask of the perfect wife and mother, carefully crafting her image for the world. It doesn’t matter how much it crushes her own family. Her hatred toward me runs so deep that I don’t know if I can even call it gender discrimination because my older sister is cherished like a princess while I’m treated as if I’m the family’s greatest mistake. Why? I don’t know.\n\nShe’d say things like, *\"Bhagwan kare tu banjh nikle\"* (God willing, you end up infertile), whore, *\"Bachpan mein hi zinda jala ke maar dena chahiye tha\"* (You should’ve been burned alive in childhood), \"shaadi k baad aiso ko hi pati jala k maar dete h\" (girls like you are burnt to death by their husbands after marriage) and many more vile comments which are normalized for me in this house.\n\nHer violence is just as relentless. Belts, hangers, rods, PVC pipes, brooms anything within reach became a weapon. Once, I came 3rd in my class, and instead of being proud, she threw a carton full of cockroaches at me. When my father left for Chandigarh for a week, she locked the kitchen and let me starve. I was a child then, crying for food, and all she did was pretend she cared in front of others. She tells people she’s so weak, so selfless, the perfect mother. But behind the curtain, she tells me daily that I should’ve died when I had the chance. She’ll smile for the world, and behind closed doors, she carves wounds deeper than any disease ever could.\n\nMy Father: He’s the only one who asks if I’ve eaten, the only one who cares about the bruises on my body. But he refuses to see her for what she is. “Adjust,” he says. “She’s your mother. She can’t be wrong. Some people don’t even have mothers, and you do.” I love him. I love him so much it hurts, his inability to stand by me, his blind love for her hurts me. It feels like betrayal, though I know he means well. I love him so much, but his refusal to see what’s happening breaks my heart into pieces I can’t even count.\n\nMy younger brother: My younger brother, who’s in 11th, doesn’t respect me. He’s exactly like our mother. She’s shaped him to be her mirror image. He beats me, abuses me, and calls me a whore. He doesn’t even treat me like a human being. This Rakhi, I refused to tie him a rakhi, but my father forced me to. I can’t believe he’s my brother. I see other classmates’ brothers and wonder what it feels like to have a good relationship with a brother. Do they fight and then apologize? Do they care about their sisters? I’ll never know. I’m too unfortunate.\n\nMy Older Sister: She wasn’t just my sister, she was my first best friend. We’re almost two years apart, and despite the discrimination I faced, it never affected our bond. When my mom beat me, she was the first person I went to. I told her everything. About school, the hospital, my life. But everything changed when she moved to another state for studies a year ago. She cut all ties with me. When I messaged her, she left me on read. Every day, I felt abandoned. Now I have no one to talk to. This made me feel unworthy of love or time, and I broke ties with everyone, even the 2-3 school friends I used to talk to online.\n\nI’ll start college next year because my mother refused to pay for any private college this year. I’ll appear for CUET next year. I begged to enroll in the CA Foundation course, and I’ll appear for the exam in January 2025. But the daily mental and physical abuse is testing me. This isn’t the life I imagined as a child. They made me hate my younger self, who was just a victim of a toxic family and environment.\n\nI asked my father to let me study at a library, but my mother straight-up told me to rot at home. Today, my brother beat me again in front of them. My father lightly scolded him, and my mother took his side. I see no meaning in life. Don’t have kids if you’re going to treat them like this. I attempted suicide many times but failed miserably because I don’t want to die. I want to live a normal life like girls my age. dress up cutely, travel, go out with friends, and be loved by my parents. I want to have a *Tom and Jerry* relationship with my siblings. Maybe not this, but I hope in another life, I have a happy home with parents and siblings who love me.",

        "text": "My friend's father (age: 58, ex army) is charged with rape and arrested on 15th June 5:30 AM. He is a grocery store owner and a reputed salesman of a cosmetic company. The girl resides in a house which is absolutely opposite to my friend's house. The girl and his brother often go to my friend's (age: 28) house when their parents are going somewhere or visiting a doctor as I am told. The relation between the two houses has always been good as I am told. The father of the victim has a Reliance petrol pump in our locality so their monetary condition is good as my friend's mother also works as a matron in a Govt. hospital so both families are pretty wealthy. \n\nOn the day of 14th June a little girl who is 3.5 years of age had come to their house to play with my friend's father. She came to their house for a long time to play and my friend's parents bought her toys and plushies so she plays happily. The accused is said to rape the little girl at around 2 pm to 2:30 pm. then the girl went to her home. And as per daily routine my friend's father opened his shop in the evening under is house and attended the shop alone till 10:30 pm. After 10:30 pm the victim's father came and asked my friend's father to follow him to their house and they insulted him there saying that he molested their child. When my friend's father asked to see the girl and asked her what have he done to hurt her, she replied \"You gave me pain in\" and when he asked \"where have I gave you pain?\" then the girl pointed towards her private part. \n\nSince then the man is in jail, I have known him for about 10 years and I have never felt such dark aura from him so I could believe this story. I have been told that the girl was tested and the report was undisclosed by the victim's family. 1st hearing was on 23rd of June where the court could not proceed with the hearing due to lack of evidence and the report not being present. \n\nHe has been charged with pocso 4 and 8 I don't know what that means. The girl was tested again on 22nd june which is 8 days after the incident and the reports are still pending. The next hearing is on 7th July. \n\nAny advice how to deal with the situation? my friend is pretty absent minded and he can not tell me all the details the lawyer has said him, he is hiding behind his mother. His mother is also physically ill due to the shock.  \n\n\n\n\nUpdate: Next hearing has been scheduled on 17/07/23. My friend has not given me or my other friends any update on the case and completely blames the victim's family for reason he himself can not sepecify anymore in detail. He started working two jobs and IDK what was the urgency of getting two jobs at this moment, while he had been jobless for more than 5 years. Not putting my nose where it doesn't belong anymore.",

        "text": "\nAs you guys would’ve heard about the Atul Subash case. I wanted to draw light upon the similar incident we as a family are facing on a regular basis at home from the past 15 years.\nMy uncle(mamu) brilliant guy did his Btech(IIT Kharagpur) MBA (Harvard). Was at once handling 33 countries at Yahoo back in 2008-09.\nHe married this girl in 2008. Girl was of Noida. Has 2 daughters with her. They after marriage were living in Bangalore.\nThe girl ran away from home took all the property papers. We came to know about the 2nd child later on. Wouldn’t let my mamu meet his children. He literally pleaded her in front of her family.\nFiled a fake case against my family that they used to beat her and ask for money. Everything fake. Hacked into our income tax records to know our property. Demands 4Cr. My mamu left his job 8-9 years back. In his words he said ,’kya fayda iss paise ka’.\nNanaji and mamu used to go to noida from Chandigarh(out home city) for every single case hearing. The distance roughly is 300km one way. Mind that they did this for every hearing and most times when they arrived there the hearing was cancelled. \nThe girl’s father is retired army officer. They judge ordered monthly maintainence charges although my mamu is jobless.\nBoth nana-nani suffered heart attacks and has to go bypass 2 times. Nani is diabetic too. They developed these as a result of increased stress.\nFew days back the girl’s father gave bribes to delhi police and they came all the way to Chandigarh and arrested my nanu without any warrant. We told them that he was a heart patient and let him carry his medications and please cooperate but all in vain and was driven to delhi and locked up for the night. Call it harassment. We told the judge. Again all in vain.\nThe girl and her dad secretly paid out lawyer which we were too late to notice . They even bribed every judge that was on the case. All results in their favour. We are still fighting that case 15 years later.\nThrough my eyes you can see my family suffering every single day, the pain of my grandparents, the whole tension in the house, all the craze for the festivals is gone and everyone is just waiting for the day when it’ll be finally over. I just want my old family back where we celebrated festivals with fun, where i can wait for my mamu bringing gifts whenever he goes abroad for work, where we as a family go to drop him to delhi airport for his flight, where he is happily married, where my grandparents are finally living not just for the sake of it, where they don’t have to worry about the police coming again,where we live as a normal family which has done nothing wrong but just living how the circumstances prevail.\nThank you for listening everyone. Each and every part above written is true.\n\nUpdate- Again an arrest warrant has been issued against my mamu for not paying monthly maintainence. Our latest lawyer is also compromised.\nThe girl has a well paying job at NIFT delhi as a lecturer.\nOne request guys can anyone of you send this post to deepika bhardwaj on twitter. My twitter account keeps on shutting down.\nRegards",

She is at an ITES employee. Her company has been WFH. She can work from office, but she keeps giving excuses to WFH. She doesn't talk to anyone in my family. My mom, dad, brother & brother's wife. She hates everyone of them. I have a bunch of cousins too. I do weekend calls with them, but my wife hates them too.\n\nShe has her reasons, and I am 100% aware of her differences with my family members, and I sympathise with her but, it is very very tough. She only talks to her parents and her younger brother. Whenever, any topic of my family comes up, she just loses it. So of course, we ensure that we never bring up my family discussions, cuz that just spoils hours and days cuz of all the fighting. Yes, I have been the asshole in multiple situations as well, and I own up to them, but mistakes happen. As adults, I thought we can take it in our stride and move on, but enough is enough.\n\nI had forced her to join cult classes so that she gets to step out and get a social life, but she stopped those classes after a few months. She is suffering in her job, but she doesn't study, and doesn't try to switch out either.\n\nMy younger bro lives 5 KM away from me, but if I try to meet him, she gets furious and starts fighting with me.\n\nI am married for 2.5+ years and other than the first 4-5 months, for the past 2 years, it has been like this. Situation is only deteriorating. Of course, we have a dead bedroom for more than 1.5 years now. We have sex like once in 2 months. That also, is if something really passionate happens, like if we watched a romcom movie. I don't see us having it now, cuz I have just developed a mental block towards her now. We are literally dragging the relationship now and pretending to have feelings for one another.\n\nI would like to initiate divorce as I can't let this much toxicity affect my life. Where do I start? Please recommend lawyers or counsellors.\n\n  \nP.S.: I have posted similar stuff earlier as well, but folks, believe me, nothing has progressed since then. It is a cold war right now and prolly more intense now. I am looking for direction to proceed, that's all.",

        "text": "Hello, this is my first time posting here. Me and my friends are right now in a very troublesome situation. We are college students, in our 5th semester, and we organised an event to welcome our juniors who joined our department this year. For this event we ordered food in bulk from a restaurant which is around 30mins away from our venue. Till the day of the event the owner told us to receive the food at around 12:30 in the afternoon but on the day of the event he suddenly changed it to 11:30. One friend of ours was supposed to go get the food using a cab. He was late because we were not prepared to go one hour early on that short notice. He reached there at around 12:00 - 12:15, took some time to load the food on our AC cab and brought back the food. We started distributing the food packets after 20-30mins after he arrived at our venue with them. That would be around 2:00PM - 2:10PM. Immediately people complained that the food was spoiled. And they were right. It was extremely spoiled. Panicking we looked for alternatives and ordered the same thing from Swiggy in bulk. When we finished ordering and apologising to everyone we called the owner and he shrugged if off saying \"I was there when everything was made\", then he called his chef, he recorded the call and sent us that recording. Basically he said \"I have everything to prove that I sent fresh food, I don't know how you guys handled it\" pointing the blame to us. We spent double the original money to get everything settled. Later at night we asked for a refund and coincidentally he started receiving bad reviews on Google Maps Businesses, Zomato, Swiggy. He related that with us saying \"Either you get the refund or you can keep on posting bad reviews\". We told him that untill further discussion we won't post anything but if this doesn't get settled the only way we as mere college students can take some action is post reviews letting everyone know about our experience. But the reviews didn't stop as we the organizing team can't control all the 100+ guests. On total till now there are maximum 12-15 reviews spread across various apps (5-6 on Maps, 2-3 on Zomato as far as I know). He's now threatening us with legal action saying that we have been mentally harassing him with all the planned \"fake\" reviews and defaming his restaurant on the internet. It's way more complicated than this but then writing everything down will take me a full day. Please give us advice on what should we do and you need clarification on any part, I will try to fulfil that as much as I can.\n\nEdit: The owner has asked us to arrange a meeting where he will bring his lawyer.\n\nUPDATE: we got a call recording between the chef and the restaurant owner where they are openly claiming that the rice being used was from the last night saying \"when we took out the rice from the refrigerator it was still intact\"\n\nis it usual for restaurants to use rice from previous nights for bulk orders? can we go forward with this point against the owner?\n\n\nUPDATE 2: we had the meeting today (23rd Aug), we went with one of our friend's relative who's a lawyer, he helped a ton, the owner actually brought his own lawyer as well although the lawyer didn't say anything during our discussion. finally we came to the conclusion that he'll try to make amends, although he hasn't declared how much he'll be paying back yet but we are right now at a higher ground.\n\nthanks a ton for all your suggestions and advice, it really helped, you have no idea how much you guys boosted our confidence.\n\nthanks again :)",

Someone came inside behind her (probably knew she was drunk) through door when she was getting inside home and forcefully raped her. She couldn't scream or resist as he had knife and she was not in whole proper consciousness and froze out of fear. But there are biting and hitting marks on her body. She can recognise the guy's face but doesn't know him or ever seen him.This happened on night of 6th oct and she has only told me about this when I came next day afternoon (7th oct). She hasn't taken bath or eaten anything except a I-pill cause guy didn't used condom so dna evidence is available. Thre aren't any cameras around our place(I checked and asked around) and none of neighbours saw anything (cause aunties would have created ruckus if they saw or knew a guy getting in girls house) and road was also empty as it was late night. I told her to go to police but she is concerned that her image and life will suffer consequences and the guy will not even get caught. She may not be able to recall the face clear enough for sketch like in tv serial cause of alcohol (which people can fail to do so without alcohol) and even if she could it doesn't guarantee him being caught. So please advice what chances does she stand of recieving justice and what proper procedure should she follow? Will police be of any help in investigation and what kind of things she will have to go through and for how long? What should she be ready for or expect to happen or will happen if the rapist is caught and/or not caught? Can whole fir and court proceedings be done without anyone outside, including her parents knowing? And will dna be enough for police to find the rapist? Please also provide any other information or advice as lawyer or someone who had gone through same thing which can be helpful.",

A few months ago, I needed money to pay part of the payment for the house, so I took a personal loan from Cred.\n\nNow that the house is ready, I need funds for the interiors. I approached my bank, and they happily sanctioned a top-up loan on my existing home loan. However, to disburse the money, they require me to close the personal loan I have with Cred. Since I don’t have the funds to close the personal loan myself, the bank has offered to close it on my behalf and disburse the remaining amount from the sanctioned top-up loan to me.\n\nFor this process, the bank needs a foreclosure letter from Cred. Unfortunately, Cred has informed me that they don’t provide foreclosure letters. The only way to close the loan is through their app, but I don’t have the funds to do so (the loan amount is approximately ₹4 lakhs). I also tried contacting Cred's lending partner, LiquiLoans, but they are not responding to emails or calls.\n\nNow I am stuck in a difficult position. I can’t pay the full amount to the interior company to complete the work, and my financial situation is at risk of being ruined—all because Cred is not providing a foreclosure letter.\n\nI don't understand, why can't they provide foreclosure letter, they are getting their money back. based on my research all the financial institutions are providing foreclosure letter. What's wrong with cred.\n\nI am sorry, if this is not an appropriate sub to post. I don't know what else to do. Any suggestions/help will be appreciated.\n\nThank you",

It all started 4-5 months ago when my cousin (her mom) found out that my niece was texting him. He’s the relative of one of her friends. When my cousin found out, she punished her and went to the boy’s house to talk to his parents, explaining that he’s an adult and my niece is just 12. They promised it wouldn’t happen again, and we all thought everything was resolved.\n\nToday, my cousin and her husband visited our home, and I wasn’t fully aware of the situation until now. My cousin shared that she’s still suspicious and caught my niece chatting with him again, this time through a hidden app. I figured out the password for the instagram and went through their messages, and what I saw completely shattered me. The innocent and loving image I had of my niece is gone. They met once in person, and there were explicit photos of them kissing. He’s an addict and a pervert who’s been grooming her, but he manipulated her into sending nudes, sharing porn, and even forcing her and emotionally manipulating her to send him money for alcohol. I literally lost it and vomited after seeing their sexting. As an adult, I would think twice before engaging in something like that, and she’s just 12.\n\nI showed everything to my cousin and her husband, and I strongly urged them to take legal action because she’s a minor about to turn 13, and he’s 21.\n\nI need advice on what we can do to bring this situation back to normal and what legal steps we can take. Any help or guidance would mean a lot right now and also which subs will be helpful if i post it there.\n\nEdit: Not my niece's personal phone she doesnt have one she's using my sister's phone andher grandma's phone. sorry i wrote not solely blamming the boy thinking someone might put blame on us for blamming the boy only as shes also equally involved not in my correct senses since morning.",

She had tried to inform about these to her mom, my mom and even the guy's mom but nobody was willing to believe her and also said that she's trying to wreck our family.\n\nMy sister was literally shivering while telling me this. And I couldn't stop crying. It is so distressing and still breaks my heart. I couldn't imagine the things she had gone through. Our family will collapse if we move on to any legal actions. And I'm not aware of the legal formalities here. Can we file a rape case after all these years? Would it be included in the pocso category even if she files the case as an adult? I'm so sad by hearing all these. I want that moron to be punished and rot behind the bars. But my sister is really scared of the family drama. And how can I help boosting her courage and comfort her? I'm concerned about her mental health as well. Idk what to do. This is so sad. Need help.",

        "title": "Caught a Thief Who Stole ₹1.95L from My GF’s Dad, but Now the Cops Are After Me – Need Advice",
        "text": "Hey everyone, this is my first post, so please excuse any mistakes. I’m 22M and a second-year law student at Delhi University.\n\nEarlier today, my girlfriend’s dad went out to buy groceries and ended up befriending someone. Unfortunately, this guy saw his debit card PIN, stole the card, and withdrew ₹1,95,000 in multiple transactions. We only realized what had happened in the evening.\n\nWith the help of a mutual friend who had been with them, we tracked the guy down. He was acting innocent and even came with us to the police station, pretending to help. The police also suspected him and registered our complaint, asking us to return the next day once they check the cameras as it was too late and the stores and ATMs had probably shut. After that, my girlfriend’s dad did not come with us.\n\nSince we were sure he was the one, we bluffed and told him we had CCTV footage. That’s when he confessed and agreed to return the money. But soon after, he switched off his phone. Panicked, we searched for him all over Sector 56, Gurgaon, and even asked the police to check his house around 11 PM. They told us to go home, but just as we were leaving, the mutual friend informed us that the thief was planning to escape to Jammu.\n\nAt this point, we had a choice—leave it to the cops (who had done nothing so far) or take action ourselves. Despite being scared, my girlfriend, her mom, and I decided to go out one last time. I knew the risk involved, but I wasn’t going to let him get away. We eventually found him in Sikanderpur, one of the sketchiest areas in Gurgaon. This place is known to be a red-light area, and it was definitely not safe for my girlfriend and her mom to be there at that hour. As soon as the thief saw me, he ran. At that moment, I knew I had to act. I chased him down, pushed him so he fell, and held him down while calling the cops.\n\nThis was honestly one of the bravest things I’ve ever done. I was terrified, but I still did what was right. In a city where people hesitate to step up, I literally did the police’s job for them.\n\nSeeing the commotion, some people nearby asked what was happening. When they heard that he had stolen money and was trying to run, around 10–12 guys gathered and started beating him. We tried to stop them (I even got punched in the process), but it escalated quickly. Under pressure, the guy returned some money and tried running again, which led to another round of beatings. Eventually, he gave back around ₹1,75,000.\n\nAt this point, we were genuinely scared. Sikanderpur is not a safe area, and with 12 unknown guys surrounding us, we were worried that they could turn on us at any moment or even run away with our money. We just wanted to leave. I spotted a police car and flagged them down. They caught him, and soon after, the officers from Sector 56 arrived.\n\nThat’s when things got messy. The police didn’t scold us—they outright told me that the thief would be charged with theft, and I would be charged with “maar-peet” (assault). It felt like a warning. I told them I didn’t hit him, but the bystanders did. The thief himself even told the cops that we didn’t harm him, and I recorded a video of him saying that. But the police looked pissed, especially after I recorded the video, and now they’ve asked us to come to the station at 9 AM tomorrow. They also suspect the involvement of the mutual friend.\n\nNow I’m feeling really anxious. I didn’t do anything wrong—I literally did their job for them. I was scared but still stepped up and showed courage. And yet, instead of being appreciated, I’m the one being threatened. We’re relieved to have gotten most of the money back and are fine with not pressing charges, considering the thief’s sad personal situation.\n\nWhat should we do now? Should we proceed with the charges despite not wanting to? Can the cops actually take action against me? They seemed really pissed off. Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nUPDATE: The parents went to the police station, around 20k are still to be recovered and the guy is saying he will pay back. I am not sure of the details because I am in college, but the parents have “thanked” the police people for being there yesterday, and nothing has really happened so far. I will update further.",

        "text": "I am sharing my experience with this dentist, she practices in lucknow. In 2017 one month before moving to USA, I visited her for regular cleaning and at the end of it, I discussed that I am thinking of getting a normal teeth whitening through bleaching. She told me bleaching is not a good option and rather than that she will apply a paint. The paint is basically the composite resin and procedure is known as dental bonding. This is not a recommended procedure for teeth whitening because it catches a lot of stain and composite resin doesn’t last and is not strong enough as enamel. She hid all those details from me. \n\nI was naive enough to trust her and I went ahead with her suggestion. She didn’t inform me fully about the procedure and when she started rather than applying the paint she started  eroding all my front teeth enamel. When I realized I started yelling and started giving her signs to stop through my hand gestures but she didn’t care to stop and throughout this she was using the machine aggressively. My consent for eroding the teeth was not taken and I wasn’t informed of that and she didn’t find it important to inform me fully about the procedure as well.\n\nAfter treatment , I confronted her so she casually said “ oh, I just removed the margin” which was utterly bulllshit. She completely disregarded what I was trying to say. \n\nI visited her so many times even after that in few weeks because I was so unhappy with the procedure and the material she applied was really low quality and it started cracking the next day itself. Despite knowing my situation she didn’t do anything and acted very rude and negligent. Obviously she knew I am anyway leaving India so she can’t do anything. \n\nBasically she experimented on me without reading about the dental bonding procedure. She knows she might face negligence charges so she is acting all innocent and claiming that my teeth were already damaged. When police visited her, she refused to provide my medical records and said she lost it. \n\nI am in so much pain because of her actions. I have no enamel left on my teeth and I am experiencing pain 24/7. I have undergone chipping correction 7-8 times so far and I experience dental sensitivity all the time. \n\nI never wanted to boast it but since I can see some of you are speculating my credentials and knowledge on how naive, illiterate or ill-informed I am about the modern day dentistry, let me share something about me, I am a very qualified researcher working in one of the biggest institutions in America currently , I have a PhD and I do hold a green card and multiple international awards overseas which I got based on my exceptional credentials in my field. Just wanted to let you know this in case you question my knowledge about things. \n\nI think this is high time people need to learn to take a lesson on how to be sensitive rather than questioning them. I am not deriving any pleasure from dragging someone down for no reason and this is not fun for me. What happened to me can happen to anyone. I am just sharing my experience so people can be careful and not fall for such fraudulent unethical doctors.\n\n\nYou can doubt me as much as you want but I have better things to do in life rather than falsely accusing someone for no reason. I have never done that and will never do that. \n\nAll I wanted was to spread awareness against her so no one else will suffer. But in case you don’t trust me, go ahead get yourself treated from her and see the result. God bless you all. ",

        "text": "42F here! Got into arranged marriage at the age of 27,  been in an abusive marriage for almost 6 years, tried almost everything to have a happy family with him but the guy rejected all the efforts. We were childless and it came out my husband needed medical help. I begged him to take the medicines but he refused everything and finally I filed for divorce.\n\nMy Husband never showed up at almost every court hearings and literally wasted another 5 years of my life in court. After being emotionally devastated for a decade I met a guy(divorced) who wanted to marry me. We shared a good bonding and I’ve thought maybe he is the one for me. The court, like always, was giving future dates and finally declared if my husband does not appear in court they will grant me divorce on the basis of ‘Ex-Parte Decree’. This guy persuaded me to get married to him asap and said “he did not want to live another day without me and people get away with murders and you are only going to get love of your life”.\n\nI was so much in love and trusted him blindly, got married(I was 37 then) to him in a jiffy and got my divorce from my first husband 2 months later. Things were good initially but it turned out to be the biggest mistake of my life. He drank and smoked too much and was very abusive under the influence of alcohol. I got pregnant with him and was hoping things would eventually turn out good for me after he became a father but I was wrong again. He literally beated me when I was 7 months pregnant and I have called my parents to take me with them for fear of any serious injury or any harm may happen to my unborn child…\n\nHe did not initiate any sort of communication after I left, I was blessed with a kid 2 months later. When my parents called his parents with the good news they kind of hesitated to talk and refused to discuss my homecoming. When my parents visited them at their house to discuss things in person they verbally abused my parents and asked us not to visit them again. This guy has told us that this marriage is not valid in the court of law acc. to hindu marriage act (as i was married to him 2 months before i got divorce from my 1st husband) and also threatened that he would take legal action against me and my family for cheating with him if we tried to reach him or his family again, he also said he did not want to have any kind of relationship with me or with his child. I was devastated again in life. I have been waiting for him ever since.\n\nIt has been 4 years now. My son is 3.5, and has never seen his father. I came to know that he has married again and I was devastated again in life. My parents are asking me to think about my future as it would be too hard to be a single parent. IDK what options do i have now, Parents are asking to get married again and IDK what legal trouble i could get into or do i need any closure from my second marriage as it was not registered in the court of law. Please give me some advice.\n    \np.s. Posting this on behalf of Sister's friend",

I am her younger brother and don't want my sister to suffer anymore. She was like my mentor whole life and I was not aware she is suffering this much alone.\n\nI have all sympathy with fake cases filed on men but as a man myself I feel women are still just an object and need more rights and laws in their favour. \n\nTLDR : sister got beatenby husband and in-laws but there is not proof like major injury.

But it made me angry enough to confront her.\n\nSo after playing badminton, i usually drive her home as we're practically neighbors, her house is 4 houses ahead of mine. So while driving i asked her if she wants to have some ice tea, our regular beverage after playing. We stopped and i started voice recorder in my phone to record everything (i kept the phone hidden and she didn't knew about it) . I asked her, straight away what happened and why she did it. She denied it a few times. Then i changed my tone to suggest as if i am conforming that if she's interested in me. Then she accepted doing it, then she told me the purpose that she felt curious how 'manly' things down there works. I told her that she literally confessed to a crime. She nodded. Then i asked some questions like did someone asked her to do so, or have i touched her, or if i was conscious or not, or i have made her uncomfortable/threatened her before, have i crossed the line with her anytime. Obv all the answers were no, then i asked the 2 big questions. Q1. Have i physically ever did anything wrong with you that i shouldn't have done. She replied with no. Q2. I asked her if she thinks that me dating her is right. She said yes. Then i clarified her that an adult with such relations with a minor is a crime and it will be better for both of us that she treat me as an elder brother. Then she said such words which never should've came from a minor mouth. She said as long as we're having fun and no one knows about it, we're fine. And i gave her 20 mins lecture on how its wrong. After this almost 1 hour long conversation i told her that all this was recorded. She immediately went blank, started to cry. I told her that this is to teach her a very important lesson, and i won't be telling this to anyone. Its just for my safety. She was panicking after that and i told her that she is fine, i won't tell anyone, and she should stop calling me by my name and stard referring to me as bhaiya.\n\nNow even if she proceeds to file a rape case against me, which i never did, i have her confession. Each and every questions that i found important, i asked her. We have met once since and she did called me bhaiya. Am i out of danger, right?",

So I live in a reputed society of Ahmedabad, Gujarat and a lady was sitting in her car right in front of the gate blocking any vehicles to move in or out. As windows were closed I signaled her to adjust car to let vehicles in and out. She became furious and told me \"Tere jese ladko ki wajah se hi R\\*\\*e hote hai\". As soon as she said this, I was shocked and I started recording video in my phone for self defense and in that video it is seen that that lady is pushing my hand. I did not circulate that video to anyone and was solely for the purpose of self defense. Her husband then came with a bouncer and was threatening me to beat and yelling and I confronted him saying let us call the police and then both the lady and her husband were silent and didn't cared to call police. I am just traumatized after this incident that how a lady knowing all the fears of such horrific incidents happening in country can casually say something like this to me(23M). She had a son too of my age! No offense to any ladies out there, I have mother and a sister too and I respect all ladies but accusing men with such words and men can't even record video for self defense just because she is a woman?!",

He has completely lost his mind and is currently in rehab. She left home with her kids and is now living with another man. She demanded 1 crore from my uncle, which he refused, saying she betrayed the family by living with another man. After that, she filed a case of gang rape and domestic violence against my uncle. Someone from my family tried to contact her and asked her to withdraw the case, but she said she would do so only if she gets the money. The police called my uncle and asked him to visit the police station. We explained the situation to the police, and they agreed that the case is completely false and that she’s doing it for money. They advised us not to contact or talk to her. Later, an officer asked my uncle to come in the evening to discuss something. Can someone please explain what we should do next? Will my uncle go to jail just because someone filed a false rape case against him?",

        "text": "(I originally posted this on r/India as I was new to reddit stuff and thinks it belongs here.)\n\nOne of my first memories was 3 year old me sleeping with my dad and he putting his hands under my panties and put my tiny legs around his hips so that he could touch his dick on my vagina...it was dark and I was wide awake at night innocently wandering what my dad is doing to me and why is he hurting me...he would kiss me on the lips in the lift when we are alone while dropping me at school, and it wasn't an innocent parent-child kiss at all. I knew it was bad enough to not ask for that kiss again infront of my mom. I knew what my dad was doing to me every night while everyone are sleeping.\n\n It was happening to me almost every night till I was 10. It felt good, but kinda knew it was something bad, that's why I never told this to anyone. I didn't know it was sexual assault, I didn't even know what that meant, but somehow I got to know that what my dad was doing would get me pregnant, so I told him when my periods started, he looked embarrassed.\n\nBut then...when I was growing in to a woman at 12, he came up to my room to wake me up and slept beside me on bed and grabbed my boobs, I ran downstairs to living room as fast as I could. He did it again.. put his hands under my pants for 10 mins when i was going out to play.  Mind you my dad was a very abusive toxic guy, all of my family members are always scared of him that's why i couldn't even oppose what he was doing since I thought he'd get mad at me...but after that incidence immediately said sorry and never did it again..\n\nI told everything to my mom and brother when I was 14...but her reaction was \" we can't do anything now, since there is no proof\" SERIOUSLY?? That freaking broke me.\n\nHe's 52 y/o now. But I do see how he still looks at little girls and touch them, their innocent parents think that my dad just love kids in general. But surprisingly I was never loved as a child as normal. I actually never felt like a child my whole childhood. And I just became the silent shy girl with not much friends my whole life. I still don't have friends.\n\nOne of the room of my house is given to 2 girls for rent. A few days before.. me, my mom and my brother went to stay at my grandmother's house (mom side) for diwali... 1 girl went to her home and 1 was left alone with my dad.\n\nHe touched her,commented on how beautiful she is and wanted a wife like her, asked if she wants to go to hotel, gave her multiple missed calls in morning, asked if she wanted ice cream and did most of the communication with her while holding her hands, told she could sleep on the bed next to him if she was scared at night. grabbed her hand while she was escaping to room. That girl was scared to death...she gave rent money and left the room the next day, she called to meet me and told me everything.It gave me flashbacks and all my trauma came back and i couldn't stop crying.\n\nI warned my dad to never talk to little girls or girls my age anymore. I can't stay in this house now.. I really cant. I can do anything to get away from my dad and this house since my mom didn't take this seriously too. I just never want to see my dad again. \n\nI want him to go to jail. Can I do anything to get justice? Sure i cannot get my childhood back, but I know that my dad isn't going to stop as this has happened 3 times before and mom doesn't want to leave him as she's not sure where to go after leaving him. This just makes me so angry and i really want to take a step about this.",

On the 2nd of February this month, one of the girls in 11th standard said she and her friend needed some help with a few chapters. I told them they could come, and I would help them because their exams were approaching. But she came alone. When I asked about her friend, she said her friend was busy doing revisions for another subject. She had not focused on the subject and seemed a bit distracted. After an hour or so, she proposed to me, I was fucking confused and told her no and to focus on her studies.\n\nI only shared this incident with my girlfriend (22F). She told me its maybe just an infatuation and not to worry about it and if she continue I should tell her parents about it or I can get in some trouble. Today was her exam on my topic, and she sent me the question paper on WhatsApp. When I tried to open the chat, she sent me some inappropriate pictures of her, which she deleted after a few minutes and said she sent them by mistake. I don't think it was a mistake. Now I dont know what to do.  \nI think I have 3 options:\n\n1. tell her parents- but my fear is that her parents won't believe me, and she may manipulate them somehow. which is easy cause no girl do this kinda shit and my little reputaion is gone.\n2. stop teaching- I don't do it for money, my freelance work takes care of that, but I love teaching and doing what I do. However, it's the easiest option for me.\n3. do nothing- accept that it was a mistake and leave things as they are.\n\nAnd I didn't tell this to my girlfriend. She might do something impulsive.

I am not sure what should I do next - pay them 50k and ask them to not proceed with the legal action or should I send a legal notice myself?\nI am panicking right now so any help or advice is appreciated. \n\nEdit: This is what they are saying caused a loss of 25 lakh \n\nMy client states that the ongoing refusal to adhere to established protocols highlights a troubling pattern of dishonesty and a lack of commitment to the company's standards.

We were made to sit in another room and were constantly threatened, harassed and our phones were taken. Initially the cops asked for 2.5 lakhs but after a lot of convincing they settled for ₹60k. A cop in civil clothes also accompanied us to the ATM to withdraw the money. When we returned to pay, they reduced to ₹50k. Idk what changed their mind. \n\nWe had tried all possible ways to get the amount down to ₹10-20k but they were not barging in, they were bullying and said this is not a market to bargain. Anything we said, they kept pressing and said they will jail us and we have to go to court. Luckily, they never hit or slapped any of us. My friend who was a girl, was made to sit in the car while we boys were kept in a room inside. She happened to click a photo of the police station to contact people in Mumbai but her phone was taken away later. When talking to the 3 star guy, a cop above his rank was passing by and they tried to hide us (felt weird as their only motive was probably to remove money from us since we were young)\n\nAnyways after two hours of waiting, they left us and asked not to inform anybody. There were around 20+ cops at the station. I wanted to know what options we had and was ₹50k without any receipt a valid fine (more like a bribe) to pay for 4 people?",

All we wanted was to have a good time during the weekend. We were trying to communicate with them in English because we are not familiar with the local language and all the while they didn’t say anything mire than monosyllables like “ganja”. Rest of the time they were communicating in their local language with each other not telling us anything.\nAfter four men searched our vehicle like madmen they eventually had to let us go because of not finding anything.\n\nMy request to the community is to please educate me about the legal rights of the so called border police.

I immediately called Air India customer care, and they informed me that the booking partner (Goibibo) had canceled my ticket. They advised me to contact Goibibo.\n\nAfter spending 30 minutes on Goibibo customer care, they claimed the onward flight was cancelled and that they couldn’t help. I then reached out to HDFC SmartBuy support, who also confirmed that the onward flight was cancelled but offered a full refund for it. However, they said the return flight was still valid.\n\nThis left me stranded, as I had already made non-refundable hotel bookings. With no affordable flights available at the last minute, I had to book a late-night bus to Goa. Traveling 13 hours with a 3-year-old was stressful, to say the least.\n\nAfter arriving in Goa, I checked the status of flight AI 9526. To my shock, it was not cancelled and departed on time. I have no idea why Air India misled both Goibibo and HDFC SmartBuy, and I was not notified properly.\n\nThis entire ordeal caused significant mental stress, ruined the start of our vacation, and left me questioning the reliability of all three parties involved. I’m now considering taking legal action against Air India, Goibibo, and HDFC SmartBuy.\n\nWhat legal recourse do I have in this situation? Has anyone else faced a similar issue? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n__\n\nLooking forward to hearing suggestions and guidance from the community.",

As the guy got to know the girl more(phone calls and chat), he realized that they were lied to, about her age and education. The girl's age was communicated to be 25 and that she was an undergraduate. This was on her bio-data. The guy's family called the whole deal off and want the jewelry they gave (on roka), to be returned. The girl's family is threatening of police case for sexual harassment and is in-turn asking for money for the expenses they had to bear for organizing roka (wtf even!?) \n\nI have a few questions? \n\n1) Can the police arrest a guy of false sexual allegations (without any tangible proof) just because the girl says so?  \n  \n2) What are the repercussions if the guy files the case here first?\n\n3) Best way to navigate this whole deal?",

        "text": "I come from Bihar and it's least say that women from there are treated shit. Dowry, wifebeating, medical, financial and verbal abuse, etc are hella common.\n\nI've grown up seeing women in my family easily getting beaten up for minor things both from meternal and petarnal side. It's very normalised but it would be big deal if women slaps back the husband and it'll be seen as something disrespectful. My aunt escaped the house in middle of the night and hasn't been back since 2019, she filed for divorce few years back but my uncle keeps contesting and going as far as saying infront of us that he'll kill her but won't divorce. \n\nThis man used to brutally beat her up infront of whole house, no shame and NOT A SINLGE person told him to fuck off or stopped. It suddenly becomes \"not our buisness\". I have witnessed all the these because they shamesly do it in front of the kids, pull the hair, punch the face and guts, she used to fall unconscious sometimes.\n\nOne of the other uncles have beaten his wife to the point of her getting ear surgery. But couldn't tolerate when she hit him back finally and he started crying victim, doesn't pay her much even tho she's housewife taking care of all the stuff and started giving tution to make her own money, the man is a fucking lawyer too. \n\nMy family is HIGHLY misogynistic, i feel greatful my parents are even letting me study still instead of throwing in AM. but nonetheless less mom teaches me the same thing but i refuse to ever tolerate this behaviour. I wouldn't even bother getting married soon or ever get in AM after seeing these, all these men doing 180° after marriage.\n\nThis isn't just in rural villages, i live in delhi and it's super common here among the women where i live, drunk jobless husbands fighting their wives using the most vulgar language you can come across. None of the neighbours do anything about it and now it became a normal everyday thing because everyone keeps chanting none of our buisness. These women themselves do not complain to the police i have no idea why, they say that it's normal and that they can't put cases on their husbands because it's sin or sum bullshit. Unfortunately they all are dependent as well with no good educational backgrounds to get a job.\n\nI feel so much rage seeing the unjust behaviour and these men walking consequence free. What can I do at all? Don't bother giving me the \"mind your own business\", these women are related to me and it affects my cousin sisters seeing these and growing up thinking it's normal for their husbands to beat them up. They follow staunch misogynistic religion too if you can guess it. \n\nIs there a way i can help my aunt and get my uncle in jail? She hasn't filed any domestic violence case yet just the divorce but i want her to, at least one case where the husband ends up with consequences would set a good example. I would want all of my aunts to leave their asshole husbands but that's impossible i know. ",

We were married for 2 of years before separating.  \nI filed for divorce 4 years ago when all talks of mutual separation broke down.  \nI have email/chat evidence of her being verbally and physically abusive towards me and have filed it with my petition.\n\nMy Ex, unfortunately, is a sadist who does not want to to sign the papers. The hearing is now ongoing for 4years. Her lawyer is cross examining me for the last 2 years. If he shows up for one hearing, he doesn't turn up for the next two/three hearings, until the judge gives them a final date beyond which the stage would be closed. The judge even closed the stage once because of frequent no-shows. However, they filed an application in the subsequent hearing and got the cross-examination stage reopened.\n\nEven when their lawyer is present for cross examination, his only motive is to ask irrelevant questions and waste the court's time. Even after two years, he is still asking questions about the time when my ex and I were dating. He still hasn't asked a single question about the facts and events mentioned in my petition that happened after we got married.\n\nI have spoken to many lawyers, including my own, about ways to get the process expedited. All of them tell me that there is very little that could be done as long as the ball is in the respondent's court. It is frustrating to see how slow the process is as I step into the 5th year of proceedings. On an average, each hearing is 45-days apart and her lawyer turns up to cross examine me once every 3-4 months.\n\nTalking to her is not an option as she has cut off all ties with me, my friends and my family.\n\nI'm turning to reddit because this seems to be my last option. Any legal advice on how to get out of this faster is highly appreciated.\n\nEdit\n\n1. We do not have any children\n\n2. She isn't doing this for the money. Personal vendetta is her only motive",

        "text": "Hello Reddit,\n\nI’m dealing with a very frustrating and urgent issue, and I need your advice on how to proceed. Here’s the detailed situation:\n\nOn Friday 13th December, I received an SMS from IndusInd Bank informing me that my account had been frozen for debit transactions following a complaint from the State Police. The bank stated that the freeze was due to a Rs. 60 transaction made to my shop's Google Pay UPI account by a person, which is allegedly linked to a fraud investigation.\n\nI had no way of knowing that this Rs. 60 transaction could be related to fraud. It seems like a small, insignificant amount, and I had no reason to believe it was anything suspicious. Upon contacting the bank, I learned that the freeze was requested by the cyber police, and the transaction in question was said to be the 5th layer transaction from one that was flagged as fraudulent by the police.\n\nI decided to visit the Cyber Police station here in Bhagalpur to inquire about the matter. To my surprise, the officer there informed me that the request to freeze my account came from Karauli in Rajasthan and said that they can't do anything and I need to go to Rajasthan. We then contacted the Rajasthan Cyber Cell with the help of some people in Rajasthan, and they were very cooperative and agreed to remove the freeze on my account, but they require an email from the Bhagalpur Cyber Police to proceed.\n\nNow, here’s where the problem has escalated: When we returned to the police station in Bhagalpur to have the email sent, the sub-inspector there flat-out refused to send the email. Why? Everyone knows why right? This is India. That too Bihar. The police can't just help a genuine person, without a few pieces of the paper with Gandhi's photo.\n\nI tried to persuade the Bank too, to unfreeze the account considering I am a customer for the bank for last 8 years. Should I lodge a formal complaint with the RBI Ombudsman portal? This is basically harassment at this point.\n\nHas anyone faced a similar situation? What are my options now? Is there any way to escalate this issue, perhaps to higher authorities or take legal action? How can I get the Bhagalpur Cyber Police to fulfill their role and send the email to the Rajasthan Cyber Cell?\n\n  \nEDIT: \n\nThe account was unfrozen on 24th December. We had submitted an application to the bank on 19th December 2024, enclosing all the relevant documents: 1. The concerned bill, 2. UPI transaction details, 3. GST Details. The bank raised the request with MHA to unfreeze the account, which got processed on 24th December.\n\nThank you everyone that helped by sharing their experiences and providing guidelines on how to approach this difficult situation for me and my family. We are grateful to you.",

        "text": "Dear all,\n\nI need your suggestion as to what legal recourse should I take. They never mentioned anything as such while I joined this organisation 1.2 years back. They issued a circular 5-6 months back stating the term and condition of the buy back. They are forcing employees left right and centre to buy the laptop they gave us to do company work, and if you deny, they refrain from giving one his experience certificate too. Need help as to what actions can I take to overcome this situation, I am planning to leave the organisation in a few months. \n\n\n\nEdit 1 : - I will make it very clear again! I am not trying to defame the organisation or spread hate or bad publicity for the organisation. It's with respect to a policy issue that has been creating issues for employees since there are a large number of employees who fail to earn even 20k a month in hand. \n\nI for one know this for a fact that a employee who resigned after 6 months of work to join another organisation while this policy was not implemented was not asked to buy back the laptop and his laptop is being used by another employee now while his data was transferred to some other employees of his department. I can say that with confidence that only after this policy was implemented (May 2024) the employees who are leaving are asked to pay for the laptops (Obviously with depreciation in price) so the employee who has already worked for a year is being asked to pay a sum of 65,000 rupess for the laptop after which the rest of the formalities will be completed is not cool. This is the entire issue and I came to this platform to ask the legal intellectuals to help me guide my way out or if this was a common practice, I would have understood and accepted it since it sounded illogical to me. It is a wonderful organisation which promotes ethos and young talents but this policy in particular is not appreciated. That's it. I am also reading a few hate comments and I would like to apologise if I hurt them in any sense! Thank you everyone for all your support and suggestions, and thank you for sharing your experiences with me.",

        "text": "First of all let me preface this by saying 2 things. I married down & I did not take dowry.\n\nThis is a long one so feel free to skip some parts if you like, though I urge you to read the whole thing because it's dramatic. popcorn and a drink highly recommended.\n\nIn the next paragraphs I would like to refer to my spouse as \"the girl\" from here and beyond because honestly she was never my wife to begin with. She belongs to the streets. This is my personal choice so please don't mind.\n\nMarried Mid 2022 (arranged, they contacted us through WhatsApp groups within same community). At the time of marriage I was employed in US and she was employed in India.\n\nEngagement + Marriage all happened within 10 days. Looking back, I'd say I had an unreasonable amount of confidence in my parents that they did all the back ground checks. My 2 selection criterias were that the girl should preferably be from same hometown and bonus if girl is an affectionate person.\n\n2-3 weeks post wedding, she reveals to me (after questioning) that she has a 10+ Lakhs loan that \"was\" taken by her parents in her own name few days before the engagement. She claimed to have nothing to do with it, and denied accountability in any regards to her personal loan. I get suspicious a little bit so I delved deeper into her laptop and find that her family has a history of taking loans. (car loan, home loan, personal loan, education loan, more loans to pay existing loans) and basically stretched their own budgets and took a loan in her name to get a gold article so they would seem \"well off\" in the wedding functions. After this news was shared with my parents, they were pretty upset that girl has a loan in her name especially when no dowry was ever asked, no gold demands were made, no money was asked and it was a complete fuck up on her families part that they sent her to our house hold with a negative net-worth. 0 was what I was expecting to start my life with her from. I am well earned till that point of time, I had 5+ years of work ex and was looking to start my life with her in US.\n\nBringing her to US would be a long endeavor, requiring a 2 year min wait and a green card. She was aware and consented to all this before marriage. 1 month post marriage I returned to US and started the visa processing steps and I would return to India every 4-6 months after that. In the meanwhile she was working from home, from my parents home, and sometimes from her parents home. Eventually after a couple months she decided that she likes it more at her parents home.\n\nEvery time I would come to India, whether it be for sankranthi, honeymoon (we had one after wedding and another one during valentines), birthdays, or anniversary, I would always end up in a huge fight with her. She was constantly fighting or creating rifts with my mom/dad. Watching all these misunderstandings happen while I was in US was tough so I tried to talk it out but nothing ever seemed to help. It was like walking on egg shells all the time. Nothing I did was ever enough. No matter how many expensive gifts I got, no matter how many trips I planned and paid for, no matter how much gold or jewelry and fancy sarees I got her during special occasions were ever enough. There would always be comparisons made to what \"others\" in her family example book did for their spouses. I would always find her mom and sister with her gaslighting and using one another as flying monkey's to teach me that \"more\" was expected. Each trip to India was like a 3-4L trip. I was like fine bro, that what a man's gotta do. All this shit will be over once we are actually abroad and there will be no noise to disturb us on a daily basis.\n\nFrom my understanding. She is a total penny-pincher. I have never seen her spend money once actually out of her own. I pre-assumed that maybe it's because though she switched the loan out of her name, she might still be paying a loan somewhere. I thought alright at least, though she isn't telling me, there is accountability in some way and she's cleaning her own messy financials. That is what I thought and similarly, to every one of her red flags I applied some dumbass justification or another. Let me also add here that there was no physical aspect to the relation ship because it was too painful for her when I tried to have intercourse. At first I thought it was genuine pain and respected that boundary but now I'm starting to doubt if that was ever true in the first place.\n\nAs the visa processing continued, things start getting very rough, during one of the trips I was in India. She 'hinted' that she would file some cases and she knows what to do. This was during one of the last days before I had to head back to US. Once I headed back the abuse continued just over the phone and video calls. By this point, I had started to get some severe doubts about her sanity. Started to read about Indian laws and soon realized that I have to start covering my bases. I started recording all the calls, all the the video calls, looking into her laptop disk (which I had snapshotted from earlier and it had a wealth of information about her) and started to realize that she was about to get married to someone right before she met me. The other family (guy) broke it off because they caught on to their bluff about their financial status long before I could. I procured her income statement and started journaling my feelings on a daily basis so I could look back and take a stand on how I feel the relationship overall because it was getting super confusing with all the love bombing.\n\nOn one fine day, during one of arguments she had a slip of tongue and accidentally said something that completely woke me up. She said that she felt no need to take care of my parents during old age and something along the lines of \"I am totally fine if they die\". That broke my heart to be honest and that's when I spent the next 48 hrs digging through all the data I had on her, reviewed everything one final time and took a decision. I canceled the citizen ship application by informing USCIS that I will not be proceeding with the application. I proceeded to inform my employer about resigning and they instead offered me a role in India for lower comp. I booked flight tickets for me to come back to India after 2023 ended. My plan of action at that point was, come to India, live with her for real without parents, assess on the ground level if going to US and having a life in US was even worth it and then take a call what to do next. Giving her green card just because we \"were\" married did not make sense to me because I honestly did not trust this girl. I didn't inform the girl about citizenship cancellation, nor job switching, I just went into isolation because it was sad that I was leaving my US career and I wanted to enjoy every remaining day in US to the fullest and free from the constant narc abuse, with friends, spending time in beautiful nature and scenic locations. When I stopped answering her calls, the isolation drove her crazy. She would constantly be on my ass trying to track what happened to the citizen ship application and I would always tell her that I am thinking about it that I don't know how I am going to proceed and that I don't think we have the required levels of trust and understanding.\n\nAfter a month of no contact, one fall evening, she shows up at my US address to my complete surprise. She came to US on a tourist visa which was granted because the interviewer saw that she had a pending GC application and gave her the B1/B2 based on her interview. She told the interviewer that she didn't want the GC and interviewer was like suit yourself. GC >>>> B1/B2. take B1/B2 and fuck off.\n\nOnce in US, she tried to woe me into sex immediately. I was like hold up..... first of all, we haven't talked in over 4 weeks and didn't you say it was hurting all the time we were in India? but apparently not anymore. When I tried to sit down with her 1:1 to level with her, it became sooooo clear that she was a covert narcissist. To her, I am just an object to manipulate and extract $$$ from and pay her loans. A child was meant to be used as a weapon.\n\nOnce I closed the door on the sex part because her traveling to US to spend time with me \"actually\" a three tier manipulation matrix along the lines of.... 1) get him (me) to have sex, use pregnancy as leverage to stay in US or dictate the relationship. 2) Next, if he doesn't comply, food poison him, teach him a lesson and 3) if he doesn't comply even then create a argument (which she is an expert in), file a VAWA petition and get a green card after proving domestic violence. All three plans were spotted early by me, but yes I was still food poisoned by her in the US while she was living in my rented apartment.\n\nAfter the food poisoning, I immediately went to the nearest the police and they forwarded me to get a restraining order. To file the RO, I approached a US lawyer and he's like this is going to be super expensive and even then to get a divorce, you would have to prove you are married in the first place which would give her an upper hand.... so all in all, this doesn't end well if you stay in US.\n\nSo, that's when I took that call that I must prepone my work relocation and move back to India and deal with whatever the fuck happens in India regardless of women's laws etc. because US divorce doesn't guarantee divorce in India. So I play this insane diplomatic game, act naive and say let's go back to India, get her to agree, book flights, and on the day of the departure....she flips and says I won't come.\n\nI had to call 911 and 2 officers show up, realize that she is dressed to goto airport, luggage is in the car to goto airport and she is stalling and squatting in a house that is not rented by her after it got dark out and these officers talked some sense into her and she got into the car and we go to the airport. After we checked our bags man that was a HUGE fucking sigh of relief for me.\n\nFast forward, We land in India in our hometown and I just walked out of the airport on my own and left her to deal with her luggage and her shit and didn't look back. After the food poisoning thing and realizing that she definitely would have filed VAWA petition I didn't respect this girl anymore even to make eye contact. just left the airport and never looked back\n\nNow it starts --- the actual drama starts\n\nGirl goes to her parents home, files 498A, 506, 509, DPA 3.4 few  weeks after we get to India. (me, parents, sister, BIL)\n\nI am in another city at the time so I respond to 41A notice electronically, get a lawyer and don't goto station but apply AB instead.\n\nShe thought I would come running to her and beg her to take back the case but I was firm on my position and had loads of evidence collected for divorce filing (under cruelty grounds) so I stayed in the same city and waited for bail to go through.\n\nIn a fit of narc rage, one rainy after noon, the girl, along with her parents and uncle break into my parents house in our hometown when we were not in the city. She starts living there with her parents. Tenants record the incident of the lock breaking but she proceeds to break in regardless. Cops were called and they sent some constables to come and check but she tells them stories of being the daughter in law of the house and they back off after taking peanut bribes\n\nAB is granted 3weeks later, we go back to home town and surrender to court and pay up for all the sureties. Parents then goto police station to file a formal complaint regarding break-in and not being able to access their own house. We get the house back after 2 days of police station visits but a lot of things in the house are broken, mom's gold is stolen, and most importantly a property in my name (original document) is stolen by the girl. Finally FIR is filed by my parents for trespass, damage and robbery.\n\nI filed divorce after this (on cruelty grounds)\n\nShe then waits a couple weeks and files RCR and a new curve ball allegation which is section 7C (family courts act) which my lawyer tells me is for dowry articles returning.\n\nThe 498A case which she filed implicates 5 people in total (including myself) but the actual complaint itself is very delusional. It alleges that 1 CR + dowry was given and that my parents and I used to beat the shit out of her regularly demanding additional dowry. She switches from english to local language and goes back and forth like an immature person. It contains irrelevant information that is inserted to seem more intense. But at the end of the day, it's basically a rant about her having to do chores in the house and waking up early. Dude I grew up doing chores like everyone else in the household. In US, there are no maids to depend on. You rely on family members to each take up some responsibilities depending on age when the maid goes AWOL. During COVID, I was in India and when there was no maid, I swept and mopped and helped my parents complete the cleaning. I made the bed, cooked when people were sick and supported in whatever I could. That's how my parents raised me - to be self sufficient. This girl is soo entitled that she put all this petty stuff as a complaint and added that she was harassed immensely and shouted at. She dragged my sister and brother in law in to this when they don't even live in the same city as our hometown. It's comical to read but I know it's still a serious court case. I am ready to fight everything in court. I will destroy this girl when the time comes with the evidence I have. I will prove my innocence and I will protect my family members.\n\nIf any lawyer is reading this or people here that know how this game works, please let me know what to do next that can improve my chances of surviving this situation and how to handle this 7C case. Thank you guys. Take care and godspeed.",

        "text": "Country: India, State: Bengaluru.\n\n\nMy girlfriend committed suicide on May 20 by jumping off the 10th floor of her building.\n\n\nRelationship context:\nWe'd known each other for 2 years. We were in a relationship for 9 months.\nShe had been mad suicidal for years, since before meeting me. Most of it because of her self esteem issues.\n\nShe was a twin. Her twin is the perfect orthodox conservative girl her parents would want. Whereas my girlfriend ( let's call her \"S\" ) fell in love and shit. S always thought that her parents deserved a better daughter and stuff. Mad suicidal. Very low self esteem.\n\nI kept her happy. Our relationship was healthy 100/100. She was so innocent and naive. I always took care of her. Was always there to hear her out when she was suicidal.\nShe told me plenty times that I saved her. and that, if I wasnt there.. she would've been gone long back.\nI kept her happy. I kept her alive.\n\n\n\nIncident:\n\nTwo days before she committed, her twin found out about us by peeking into her college mail ID's google photos (college mail ID logged in her laptop. auto-synced media) and she incriminated S to their mum.\nHer mum travelled from state A and reached state B (where S lives with her two roommates) the very next day.\n\nS works night shift. 6pm to 4am. The day they found out.. they shouted at her the whole day. Slutshamed her. She's the most innocent, naive, *one guy for life* kinda girl you could ever see. Her parents knew it too. But they still questioned her as if she was planning to be a whore for life. Emotional abuse.\n\nShe didnt sleep that day. Went to office by 6pm. Contacted me from office and let me know everything over gmeet call.\nThe next day morning her mum reached state B and continued the emotional abuse. They'll speak badly, make her cry, console her and make her cry again.\nS didnt sleep that day too.\n\nEvening 6pm office again. Told me everything. I helped her do her work. Told her that things will turn out alright.. and was supportive in every way. I was on gmeet call till 3:30 pm.Then I went to sleep.\n\nS hadnt slept for two days now. She missed taking her anxiety meds too as mum was home. (Parents do not know about psychiatric medication. They never trusted psychiatry. She had anxiety. Once attempted to hang herself in April. I saved her, travelled from state C to state B ( we live in different states too ) to be with her, had her consult my psychiatrist over call and got her on medication. )\n\nAfter I went to sleep by 3:45, S left office by 4. Her mum called and kept abusing her throughout the cab ride to her apartment too. At 4:30 in the morning that is.\n\nShe reached her building. Her apartment is in the 10th floor. She went to her floor. She didnt have it in her to go inside the door to face her mum, where she would be waiting with a mouthful of hurtful words.\n\nShe jumped off the 10th floor.\n\n\nHelp:\n\nI have all whatsapp, discord chats where she says how suicidal she was, how her parents never understood, how they stressed her out, and how much I saved her. How healthy our relationship was, how happy she was with me.. everything.\n\nI do not have any chat/message/recording of what she said to me the night before she suicided. It was all over gmeet call.\n\nNow I've been contacted by State B's police. Asked me to come to state B for enquiry. Because her father suspects me.\n\nHELP:  What should I know? What should I be ready with? \n\n\nNote: Her father is a big shot. He has contacts. Politicians, Police cmmissioners, etc etc. And definitely access to lawyers who could spin the story on me.\nIm a little scared and anxious.\nBecause though I know that I was 100% not responsible for her suicide..  I also know that her father's lawyers can spin the story and paint me the bad one.\n\nI need help.\n\nPlease.",

She is very disciplined and does well in her studies.\n\nInitially, she used to complain that her teacher would get angry for no reason and yell at every child in the class. One day, when I went to pick her up, I saw her teacher yelling at one of the kids. I immediately reported this to the school. That same day, I received a call from the coordinator. I told her that I would not send my daughter to school until her class was changed or the teacher was removed. She asked me to come to the school to meet her in person.\n\nWhen I went to the school, she assured me that she would address the issue but also blamed it on the fact that my daughter was still adjusting to the Indian system. She also mentioned that the teacher had been with the school for many years.\n\nFor the next few weeks, everything seemed fine, but then we started noticing behavioral changes in our daughter. She began saying sorry even when she hadn’t done anything wrong. She got scared if her nails weren’t trimmed. She became excessively anxious about completing her homework. When she fell sick, she worried that missing school would make her teacher angry.\n\nWhen my wife tried to discuss these concerns with the teacher, she dismissed them, saying that we were worrying too much and that schools in India function differently from those in the US.\n\nI feel I should do something about this school. I think others simply take their kids to different schools. But ideally this school should be penalised for harassing students. \n\nAny advice?",

However, in the consent form Dr had mentioned some technical term which was not explained to me that it meant removal of an organ. At the time of taking consent and before entering the Operation theater, it was never indicated that removal of the organ may be a remote possibility. Infact, the Dr assured me even at the time of going to the OT that there was no need for the removal of organ. I can understand that during OT there could be circumstances which lead the Doctors to decide the remove but my concern is that I was not at all informed that it was removed even after the surgery and during the 3 days of post operation stay at the hospital. Infact, I only got to know about the same after 6 weeks when I fell sick again with 104 degree fever and was sent for another sonography, I was shocked to know about the fact. At that time my husband went to speak to the Doctor and she clearly denied. I fail to understand why she could not inform me and on confronting denied accepting. Secondly, she did not remove the Polyp which was clearly mentioned in the discharge summary (again I was not informed about it). It was only when I went for the second opinion to another hospital, that I got to know that Plolyp need to be surgically removed and that it could have been removed during the first surgery which for some reason Dr decided not to remove. Infact three separate doctors whom I consulted at the time both were surprised why it wasn't done. \n\nCan anything be done against the hospital \n\n1. for removal of organ without consent or informing me even afterwards and defending that it was mentioned (technical/medical terminology was mentioned which a layman cannot understand) in the discharge summary.\n\n2. Not removing polyp during the first surgery as I had to go through mental and physical pain and suffering due to the delay.  Now they charged me another 60k for the surgery to remove the Polyp.  \n\n3.Finally when I went to get the Polyp removed in October. They had asked me to get the sonography done which showed that both the ovary is present.  Subsequently when I raised, the hospital apologised and refunded the cost of sonography. \n\n4.Also, it appears some one has tried to sign my signature in the consent form and risk assessment form which I got to know recently when requested medical records from the hospital.\n\n  \nWhat is the limitation period for Medical case if filed in consumer court.",

        "text": "\nAbusive Gay husband, reveals homosexuality after two years, leaves country, police corruption, cases going on for 3 years, mediation asks to drop cases and let it go or it will take 20 years\n\n1. In a small city of India, my friend married a person.\nThe guy was working in India, immediately in a week he moved abroad without consummation . Once there he stopped communicating, would only message once a day, to order my working friend to cook, clean and serve the inlaws.10 years older Unmarried sister of the man lived in that house and was having an affair with a married man.  She was left with the in-laws and the guy’s sister also  started torturing her. The mother, father and sister’s torture was so harrowing, still my friend didn’t discuss this with her family as she had chosen this person.\n\n2. This sister was almost 40 years old and was having a boyfriend who was married to another woman. The boy’s family had only two bedrooms and this sister slept with my friend. She used to do nude video calls with this married man and disturb my friend. My friend’s husband supported his family’s torture, demanded money from my friend in order to return from abroad. She used to spend all her salary on her husband and family with nothing left for her.\n\n3. She would be woken up at 5:00am in the morning by placing two alarm clocks near her ears. After getting up she was asked to do work, then go to office, then come back and work. Everyday the unmarried sister of the guy would physically assault her and his parents as well.\n\n4. After a few months the guy returned but he had fever and red rashes all over his body. He still avoided being with my friend. He was always taking some tablets secretly. My friend was very confused.\nShe was feeling hurt that this guy is on purpose hurting her and allowing other’s to abuse her. And once again he just left abroad and started only being in touch with his family and avoided my friend. She was not allowed to go live with him. She was being treated like a maid and-not his wife. There are 100s of abusive chats on her Whatsapp\n\n5. My friend then decided to go abroad on her own. And when she did her husband physically assaulted her, and tried to kill her. Multiple times. Still out of love she lingered on, hoping he would change. He didn’t. She came back and when she went to her in-laws house she was thrown out. He didn’t bother getting her back, even though she was still trying her best. After 2 years he confessed that he is a homosexual and bipolar. So immediately her family filed a police case.\n\n6. The interesting part comes now. You’d think that she is having so much whatsapp evidence of her torture and the police had all of it. But they let him move abroad. He has absconded since 2021. He is paying his lawyers to stay out of this country. My friend is living the life of a widow because a homosexual decided to turn her life into hell.\n\n7. The lower courts also are working in the husband’s favor. Despite numerous evidence, the Police let his family be exonerated but in court they were charged with - “Hence, cognizance of the offense U/s.354, 354-A, 377, 307, 379, 323, 406, 498-A, 420, 294, 34 of I.P.C. and u/s.4 of Dowry prohibition Act is taken- There is sufficient ground to proceed against the accused persons'. “\n\n8. Even after being charged with such sections, they are bribing everyone to quash the case. Recently, the judge presiding over the case met the guy and the girl and started convincing the girl to drop the case even though she has evidence and witnesses .  But she is adamant to get justice as this msn has destroyed her life, she suffers from migraines and PTSD and is now in her late 30s.\n\n9. What would be the correct way to approach this? How to ensure justice when justice has a price and the victim is paying the maximum?\n\n\n",

Ours was an arranged marriage and they (my in-laws) didn't tell us about my brother in law having a mental health disorder called bipolar disorder. 2 years into the marriage it was revealed that my BIL has such issue that too when he had a maniac phase. Now my husband has been telling me to take care of his BIL just like how my MIL does and I have to take care of him after them as I have no choice. I retaliated by telling him as I can't give him such care, for which he simply says there's no choice. I told him I was not told before marriage about this, and he is not listening to me. I have already faced many issues in this marriage regarding my in law's relations with my parents, comments by my in-laws on my parents gifts during our marriage and many more things. I do love my husband a lot and I am committed to him in all ways, but all of this makes me suffocate in this marriage. I already have a child to take care off and now this responsibility is over whelming for me. I am not telling him nor do I want him to leave looking after  his brother at all.. but burdening me with this responsibility is what I am not ready to do. I have my own future plans too. I want to know what are my options if his stance doesn't change over this? ",

        "text": "So we are a small college where mostly people from UP, Noida and these places come. Women here come from very strict family backgrounds. Before, we could come and go as we pleased with a 8:30pm deadline. But now, they're introducing a biometric system for every time we leave college premises. A message will be sent to our parents with in and out timings. Food stalls, basic amenities are all outside campus but nearby. Every girl goes outside at least once or twice, but the biometric system means their parents tracking their every move and possibly restricting them to leave.\n\nThey always imply such rules for girls and girls seem extremely powerless every time as we have no support from college or parents and as college students most of us don't have the financial security or freedom or any sort. Boys on the other hand have 0 rules imposed on them. Forget their parents knowing one thing about what they do. They do all this in name of safety for the women but it's literally taking very basic rights we should have as adults.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nEdit: My college is extremely misogynistic and boys here they do a lot of illegal stuff, end up in hospitals, police stations etc but my college always covers up for them and keep restricting women more and more. We have never done anything even close to illegal or bad. Forget weed, smoking drinking nothing. Boys do hard drugs, break bones, knife fights, keep dangerous weapons.\n\nAll the people who've given legal advice I don't think anything can be done about it but thanks for sharing :)\n\nAll the non legal ones, like I said boys have broken the boys hostel biometric already and only they can break ours. If us girls even try we will be kicked out or have to bear heavy consequences. \n\nAlthough advices about acetone, sand, slowly breaking it, loopholes really help out a lot.\n\nThanks for he help :)",

Let's start from the beginning, so she told me that her dad forcefully has s*x with her and wouldn't listen even when she screams and tells him to stop. She said that she has told her elder sister about this and her sister just ignored the topic.. she says that if she tell this to her mom then her mom would immediately blame her for this happening since her mom is very old minded woman. I suggested that we should file a case against him but she said that even if she wanted to she cant, since her \"dad\" is the only person to earn money in her family so her family would just not be able to survive without the financial support. It's been months since she told me this and it has been eating me alive so I recently found out about reddit so here I am looking for advice... what should I do to get her out of the horrible situation she is in.. \n\nJust a point to be noted..\nWe are residing in mumbai so please provide some advice according to the situations in mumbai ",

The product was received by my mother, as I was travelling at that time. Since I was going through airport security, I had given her the OTP . I never had an adverse experience with Flipkart before, so I believed that the \"goods should be as expected\". However, I was wrong and a cheaper model was delivered (15.6\", i5, MRP: 62,999). I promptly raised a return request and Ekart came to pick it up the next day. However, on examination, the delivery boy found a speck of bubble on the screen (like an air bubble when you put a screen guard), which neither I nor the lady who had delivered the product had noticed. Ekart refused to pick up the product because they were scared that in case of an issue, the amount will be deducted from his salary.\n\nEkart and Flipkart advised to cancel the Return and raise it again based on \"Multiple issues\". I followed their advice.\n\nHowever, since the last 2 days, I have been on call with multiple Customer Care representatives, who refused to provide a resolution saying it was Open Box delivery so the onus is on me. The Ekart personnels who could vouch for my version of the problem are unavailable.\n\nI understand that everyone has their SOPs, but now I am stuck with a ~Rs 50,000 defective product which was supposed to be a birthday gift for my father who turns 61 on Oct 5.\n\nEDIT 1:\nFiled a complaint with Consumer Helpline and tweeted. But, not very hopeful. \n\nThere are 2 schools of thoughts here:\n1) Who have faced similar issues and can sympathise/empathise. \n2) Who are calling us naive dum-dums (perhaps, rightly so). \n\nTo (2) I would like to say that not every situation is black/white. There are nuances to each. The SOPs are always up for deliberation, to be made better. \n\nEDIT 2:\nBelow constructive advices were given:\n1) File with NCH - done\n2) Tweet - done\n3) Block CC charges - initiated",

        "text": "This was a 7 year long relationship, started with the intention to get married from the very beginning. We had been taking vacations and engaging in physical intimacy since the first month of this relationship. Her parents came to know of it around 3-4 years back and allowed us to date freely. Around 4 months back, both families met together and had a written agreement (known as a lagna patrika) in the presence of a priest, thereby fixing a date of marriage. We then proceeded to engage in shopping for marriage (I bought her whatever she wanted). She then moved to another city, with me reaching there about a week later to help her settle down. I rented out a 3BHK and furnished it fully, with the intention of staying together over there after marriage. After living there for almost two months, I proceeded to head back home. Within a couple of weeks of reaching home, she had a verbal arguement with me over the phone and all of a sudden returned me some of the money that I had spent for the marriage shopping and called of the marriage, blocking me and my family from everywhere (Phone, WhatsApp, Social media etc). We tried to contact their family several times, yet none of them got in touch with us. After about three months, my family went to their house to try and sort things out, but they were insulted and thrown out of their house. Her brother even threatened physical harm to my mother. The entire conversation was recorded. She then proceeded to unblock me and threatened committing suicide if I didn't stop pursuing this.\n\nI have invested a lot of time, money and effort in this relationship. Due to all of these events, I suffered a severe mental breakdown and lost a lot of social credit. She has since returned a part of the money I invested into the apartment. \n\nI would like to initiate legal proceedings against her and her family for breach of promise to marry. I have evidence of cohabitation, evidence of spending huge amounts of money and effort during our 7 year courtship. What are my options?",

        "text": "Lawyer here, currently practicing in Delhi High Court! Just wanted to share some Landmark rulings of the court on the rights of women in live in relationships in India. \nIn India, there have been several landmark judgments that have recognized and upheld the right of women in live-in relationships.\n\nHere are some of the significant judgments:\n\n1. Indra Sarma vs V.KV. Sarma (2013):\n\nThe Supreme Court of India held that a woman in a live-in relationship is entitled to maintenance from her partner under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005. The court also held that the definition of 'wife' under the Act is not limited to a legally married wife but includes a woman in a live-in relationship who has been in a relationship with a man for a significant period and is financially dependent on him.\n\n2. D. Velusamy vs D, Patchalammal (2010):\n\nThe Supreme Court held that a relationship between a man and a woman living together for a considerable period would be presumed to be a marriage if the couple had held themselves out to society as being akin to spouses. The court also observed that a live-in relationship could be considered a valid marriage if the couple had lived together for a long time and had a mutual intention to marry.\n\n3. S. Khushboo vs Kanniammal (2010):\n\nThe Madras High Court held that a woman's choice to live with a man, even if they are not married, is her personal decision, and society should not interfere in such matters. The court observed that live-in relationships are not illegal or immoral and that the stigma attached to such relationships is unwarranted.\n\n4. Payal Sharma vs. N.K. Sharma (2004):\n\nThe Delhi High Court held that a woman in a live-in relationship has the right to claim maintenance from her partner under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The court held that a woman in a live-in relationship could be considered a 'wife' for the purpose of claiming maintenance.\n\n5. Chanmuniya vs. Virendra Kumar Singh Kushwaha (2011):\n\nThe Supreme Court held that a woman in a live-in relationship for a long period would be entitled to the same rights as a legally married wife. The court observed that the nature of the relationship was not important, and the intention of the parties to treat each other as spouses was what mattered.\n\nThese landmark judgments have played a significant role in recognizing and protecting the rights of women in live-in relationships in India. The judgments have helped to reduce the stigma attached to such relationships and have provided legal recognition to the rights of women in such relationships.",

        "text": "\nWe went to the Police Station yesterday to file a complaint against the guy.  After thorough investigation by the Police, a written statement was taken from me, and the guy was asked to come down to the station. When he was called for the first time, he said he would be there within 30mins so we waited. He was called again after 45mins, and this time he said his manager would be coming instead. We waited 45mins more for his manager to come and no sign of him either. By this time the delivery guy’s phone was switched off. After waiting for 30mins more, his manager was phoned and asked to come down to which he agreed. 1more hour passed, the cops started getting pissed as both were fooling the police now by saying one of us will come in next 10-15mins and still no sign of either of them. The manager was called again as to know why he is not bringing the delivery person, his answer was that – ‘sir, he is scared’. This was the same delivery person who was confidently smiling and saying I could complain wherever I want, to whomever I want to, and nothing would happen. Where was his showy bravery now? Anyways, after making the Police unit wait for 3.5hrs they both finally arrive at the station. The delivery guy’s statement was taken. As he was giving the statement, he started addressing me as Madam. His whole demeanor had changed,from being pompous to suddenly a respectful man. The same man that disgustingly remarked on me being alone at home and wanting to know what I was doing, the same guy laughing and smiling while denying the order and enjoying the part where I still wanted the order and was asking him to stop. No right-minded delivery agent asks what you are doing inside alone just because you are late to open the door and especially after noticing that you in fact are alone. At most they will ask what took you so long, show some frustration on their face. So, it was none of this freak’s business to comment on whether I was alone or not which was just blind sided by some people here because they wanted to shift the entire blame to me and sympathize with the delivery guy. Well, guess who had the last laugh now (referring to someone saying that I harassed the guy and if he had complained against me, what would happen and who would have the last laugh) after the Police detained him and now a petty case is on his way, unless I request them not to file one. His arrogance that his misbehavior, teasing won’t be taken seriously and that too by the Police? A lesson was taught. I have also posted on twitter, emailed Amazon’s grievance officer, nodal officers, customer executive regarding the incident as told by some people. Thanks to all you people who thought that this was a genuine concern and provided your inputs on what I should do next.\n\nTo the other set of people here who said that I felt entitled cause I have money, It was not harassment, I am the one who harassed the guy, I am overreacting, ‘YTA’, I am looking for validation, I am whining, I am taking it to the next level by making it about women’s safety, I need to do this on twitter instead of reddit, I was desperate for the order, labelling as borderline classism and what not. I am just glad that I didn’t listen to your comments. And what had to be done is done by the Police. I pray for the women in all your lives and I hope a day doesn’t come in your life where some stranger that just needs to do his assigned job comes to your door and says to your sister/mom/any woman in your life- ‘pata nahi akheli kya kyakarri hai andhar’ cause they were late and also starts mocking, teasing around with the order and has no fear of consequences. I say this cause these women disappointed in you all. This man made the Police wait for 3.5hrs. Guess who is the entitled one now? And yes, like someone commented Respect goes both ways, thali dono hath se bajti hai, I agree with you. In no way he was respectful to me in the entire incident, so I gave back what I got from him.",

Because of various reasons, we had to see each other unfortunately so there is no running away from him. He used to talk random things after that and cleared it to me that we can be friends. I was not interested in that too but I didn't want to have the consequences of abruptly rejecting and blocking him so we became friends with each other.\n\nOne day I had to block him because of constant messages from his side (which I hated), asking my whereabouts when I was travelling back to hometown. I may have overreacted by blocking him out of nowhere, I could have explained him to stop bothering me for sometime but that happened, I blocked him. Now when I am in my hometown I received a call from one of my male friend claiming that the senior is in extreme rage because of me blocking him. Senior said (as told by my friend, translated from tamil to english), \"Ohh, so she's showing her arrogance by blocking me? Now I shall show my arrogance. She is 4 years younger than me but still I kneeled and proposed to her in front of everybody. Now I will rape her in front of the college and will let everybody see.

I wanna file a complaint right now on this issue but her dad is working abroad and he is the only source of income for her family, her mom has a lot of health issues that needs a lot of money for treatment.

I feel nauseatic since she has said me this, I've never felt this kind of helplessness in my life, but she's too afraid to take the action herself due to the above issue, she's also from a Muslim community and that makes it even hard to proceed with what I'm doing as I'm a Christian. She is turning 18 in a couple of months and I'm too afraid to even think what's gonna happen to her after that.

He was young, around 23M, let's call him Ashish. When he arrived at his seat, a woman around 40W with passenger 25M was seated on his seat. He politely told her that it was his seat. She kindly answered that she wanted a seat with her passenger and asked him to sit far behind (not a window seat). Ashish reminded her that it's not her seat and he booked it in advance then the lady shouted \"Didn't you hear me dead I am not getting up, don't disturb me \" Then her passenger started barking like hell \"Stop involved personal life and Now shut up and go\"\nAshish didn't get a chance to explain to the air hostess. The air hostess asked to get away, and when he explained that it was his seat. The hostess didn't say a word and continued to push toward the back.\nHe repeatedly asked, shouting that it was his seat. Who was she(the lady 40 W) to tell him what to do? Now, one listened to him, and everyone just said. I wanted to help but I also lost hope. After the flight takeoff, the lady passed near me, and Ashish was beside me. She just smiled a little and said, \"Waste fellows\".\nIf this happened to me what can I do \n1) what to do with a passenger and a hostess does nothing? What can he do?\n2) where can I complain against her and the air hostess \n3) What can I do if similar things happen on a train where the passenger has taken all the space under the seat and is disrespecting me ",

My father on listening all these details got really anxious and scared. My father suffers from bad anxiety.\n\nThe caller then threatened my father that his Son-in-law (my BIL) has been kidnapped by them and demanded 1.50 lakhs, to be given to him in person at some location which he didnt disclose, to get him released. He made my father swear on god to not inform family or police about it and if he attempt to inform then his son in law will be beaten brutally and future consequences will be bad for us which he didnt disclose.\n\nMy father panicked and cut his call and immediately called my BIL to know that he's safe at his workplace and no such incident happened with him. Afterwards, my father went to police station and lodged complaint regarding this.\n\nNow more than anything else, I'm worried that caller knew all the information about our family, our work and home locations. Ive an exam in 2 days and ive lost my focus and my father has been panicking alot. \n\nIdk if i need help or i just wanted to vent out but its so scary to be at receiving end of all this turmoil.",

        "text": "I bought a Samsung S24+ for Rs70k+ and exchanged old device which valued Rs12,925, including a Rs10,000 exchange bonus. First of all he said I would get a notification in the Flipkart app about my exchange, and he left, saying he had other deliveries. I got an SMS for consent for exchange which I provided. The delivery guy then called me from his personal number and asked me to pay Rs5000 Extra, even after of Rs 10000 bonus. This doesn’t make sense at all. Even in the worst case, I would only have to pay maybe ₹2.5k to ₹2.9k. Then he had the nerve to ask me to transfer ₹3,000 directly to him if I wanted the phone delivered! His exact words were \"Company ko denge toh 5000 dene padenge, mujhe 3000 do abhi kar dunga\", I refused and confronted saying that 10k was the exchange bonus to which he replied with \"3000 toh fir bhi dena hi padega na\". I was not able to record this call as I have been doing online purchase for years and this was just another delivery for me but it went other way.\n\nI asked him to come to the address and I will pay the remaining amount, but I guess till now he felt that I knew this is a scam. He tried raising a cancellation request showing that I am refusing delivery and I received an OTP for cancellation. He said \"Sir OTP aaya hoga exchange ke liye\", I said that I won't give any OTP unless he is on the address and he disconnected the call.\n\nI tried calling him back, with intention to record it on call and ask him to visit the address so that I can record him on camera, but he didn’t pick up. Later, I got a message that my order was canceled, without any OTP or approval from me. Now, I’m being refunded the amount with Rs199 less, meaning I lost ₹199 for the pickup charge due to Flipkart team’s mistake and the delivery guy's unprofessional behavior. In the end, I didn’t get my order, I lost ₹199, and I’ve had to deal with this awful service. Some reddit users suggested that I will receive this ₹199 refund too but I have not received any message till now regarding this.\n\nAnd the support guys are just cherry on top, \"Sir nothing can be done now as the order is cancelled\" LOL atleast register a complaint if I am saying so, I have to literally school a support girl to get my complaint registered.\n\nMy order was cancelled stating that the product is damaged. No OTP, no Email, just a refund message.\n\nI might have avoided a potential scam but don't know how many decent buyers fall for such scams daily. I just want to keep everyone aware on this and possibly need advise on the ways action can be taken on the delivery guy. I don't think Flipkart will take my complaints seriously but I lack any evidence to make it a strong case.\n\n  \nEdit: What I have done till now - 10+ calls to support. Posted on Twitter and Reddit. Registered complaint to social media team and normal support team. I asked the support guy twice if I will get the pickup charges refunded as its not my mistake, he said no. He had no resolution except registering a complaint, which I did.\n\nEdit 2: FK support team says they are able to see the exchange value of Rs12726, so ideally I should’ve paid only the 150-200rs difference.",

He tried to threaten him saying he will do a police complaint and tell his family about what he's doing. But he didn't react at all and said he's family will never believe he can do something like this and that he's the perfect son even had the audacity to say he's not scared of police and getting the police involved will only damage her reputation and her parents won't be able to trust her ever again. He said he had connections and you won't be able to do anything. but after some time he said he had no intention to blackmail her and just wanted to talk to her but she was rude (she definitely should be as he treated her like shit) to him and wasn't picking up the call so he sent her the pic so that she will talk to him. He said just wanna talk to her on call once and if she wants he will never contact her again. My friend talked with him on a conference call and we recorded the call as well. He said he was worried about her and just wanted to know if she's okay but did this because she was rude and wasn't picking up the call. He said he deleted the picture (which I don't believe he did) she clearly told him that she don't wanna talk to him anymore so he said he won't contact her and he want her to call him when she is done with her graduation. This is how the call ended. She don't think he will do anything but I'm not sure.\n\n\nI'm greatfull to everyone who replied to this post.",

My uncle (my sister's father and my paternal uncle) called my grandfather's friend's son, who is a sub-inspector in the police. I don't know if bribe was involved, but the sub-inspector said even if you break his head, we'll handle it. Seven of my family members (all were male), went to that shop, along with the sub-inspector. They took my sister with them. This happened around 12pm today.\n\nThe guy is of different religion. I honestly didn't know this would take a religious turn because they went to the shop and started beating him up. Just with their hands, no weapons were involved. Now the inspector says we need to cover this up and threatened the shopkeeper that if his name comes out, his shop will be shut down. He didn't say anything at that moment and just nodded in agreement.\n\nBut now, this has become a religious issue. I don't know if he called his relatives or friends, but he has threatened us, and now the matter has taken a religious turn. We are going to file an FIR, my uncle and some other family members are at the police station right now. I really don't know what's going to happen.\n\nMy sister is leaving here in a few days after her semester break ends.

Upon arrival, I discovered that the company operates in the stock market sector, providing services to clients such as stock market tips and advice, particularly in options trading. My interest in the finance field, especially in the stock market, made me intrigued by the role. \n\nDuring the interview, I wasn't asked any technical questions. The interviewer only inquired about why I wanted to join the company. I am aware that providing stock market tips without proper registration is illegal, and in order to give financial advisory services, a company must be registered with SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India). When I asked if the firm was registered with SEBI, they confirmed that it was not, despite the company having operated for over four years. I questioned them further, asking why they hadn't registered with SEBI if they had been operating for that long, and what would happen if a client incurred losses and reported the firm. The interviewer nervously responded that their operations were completely legal, and they were confident no one would report them.\n\nAfter that, the interview ended, and I was asked to leave with a promise that they would inform me if I was selected. Once I got home, I messaged the HR department, and they informed me that I was not selected for the job.\n\nDuring my time there, I noticed some peculiar things. I saw a group of employees, mostly girls, rehearsing scripts designed to attract new clients. They had a detailed sheet of questions and answers. The building's exterior looked completely rundown, almost abandoned, but the interior was lavish, resembling a five-star restaurant. Surprisingly, even though the company deals in stock market services, there were no signs or banners indicating its name or industry. Instead, the walls were covered with matrimony slogans featuring pictures of couples, which left me quite puzzled. \n\nOverall, the entire experience felt strange and raised several red flags about the legitimacy of the company\n\nI took screenshot of the job posting from workindia and also reported them.

        "text": "I am 25M from North India, I have a very long relationship with my girlfriend and we are planning to marry. When I told this to my parents - my dad constantly warns us that  he'll commit suicide and tries to provoke us even in very small matters. This problem only arose because my girlfriend's caste is not as same as me. We already had a lot of heated discussions and calm discussions - all stop when he starts mentioning suicide. He creates a web of lies just to create any narrative that casts me in a negative light to my friends and family.\n\nHe has already blackmailed me and my gf multiple times - violence, mental harassment, police action and what not. What can I do in this case? Is there a way this can still be dealt with amicably?",

        "text": "My cousin brother got married in 2022 to a woman who had been having an affair before the marriage. Her parents forced her into the arranged marriage, and she didn't confess about her past until after the wedding. She showed little interest in household activities and seemed disconnected. When my brother asked to borrow her phone to make a call, she refused, citing it was her personal phone. This raised suspicions.\n\nUpon investigation, her phone revealed evidence of her infidelity, including chats and messages. Furthermore, bank statements proved that she has a nearly 8-figure bank balance, demonstrating her financial independence. Despite this, she's seeking alimony and monthly maintenance.\n\nWe've submitted these evidence, including social media chats and bank statements, to the court, but the case still favors her. It seems the Indian judicial system prioritizes the woman's claims, regardless of evidence.\n\nThe woman has also filed a counter-complaint, alleging that my brother's mother tortured her. They've appealed to a higher court, but haven't received a response yet. My brother's family has endured years of emotional and financial pain. I'm seeking advice from a good lawyer to help them.",

She got miscarriage during pregnancy because of MIL harrasement and when she got a girl child everyone change.\n\nFinally after so many years she got the courage to file for divorce and contacted a lawyer, she doesnt even know her husband salary. \n\nShe is working and doesn't want anything for her by husband is denying support for his daughter and telling everyone she ran away.\n\nSo is there any way we can know the husband's salary. Have tried asking my network for favour. \n\nTLDR : don't know husband salary and husband denying even child support to the daughter. Can we get salary details in any way?\n\nEDIT - it took her 4-5 hospital visits, she is on depression meds and therapy for last 2 years, and living in an abusive marriage for 7 years to even consider seperating for sake of health. Northern part of india is still backword and don't want a girl child.i know some of the friend's family where women are beaten to death and still they are living for the sake of child because they are financially dependent on husband.\n\nWish I could upload pictures of beatings, reports of hospitals to even stop this money extortion debate, but i know it won't mattey. The father simply denied the money for the child saying his salary is less. We willing are not at all asking money for wife. I have been paying from my salary for last 6 month for child education and rent.\n\nImagine you ask your father to pay for your college educcation and he simply denies and says ask your mother. And if you ask for your rights as a legitimate child of your father, you are blamed with extorting money.\n\nAND YES CHILD SUPPORT DEPENDS ON HUSBAND SALARY AND STANDARD OF LIVING BECAUSE A CHILD CAN BE PUT IN GOVT SCHOOL , EAT MID DAY MEAL AND FREE RATION FOOD AND LIVE IN A VILLAGE. SO FATHER SHOULD NOT GIVE ANY MONEY AND SIMPLY GET MARRIED AGAIN AND SENT NEW BABIES TO BEST SCHOOL, PRIVATE COACHING AND FORIEGN TRIPS YEARLY.\n\n\nNOW I UNDERSTOOD WHY DIVORCE IS A TABOO FOR WOMEN.\n\nI HAVE GOT KIND WORDS AND ADVICES.

Once she tried suicide he got scared and called her parents, emquired about the meds and told them to take her with them as he was scared she would try suicide again.\nBoth parents spoke and both sides agreed for medical examination from a psychologist,  and counselling too. Then the girls fam met the doc just after her diagnosis and spoke something in terms of \"pls dont spoil our girls life etc\". The doc called both sides and told, they both can live together but she need a 24x7 adult supervision.\nNow both have been living separated for 1yr and for mutual divorce they are demanding 20lakhs (stating the girls cousin has the same issue and they got 20L from groom as alimony).

        "title": "Insurance Company dropped a bombshell on me! Am I fucked?",
        "text": "Hi, \nI am a 35 year old working professional and I have a medical insurance policy from New India Assurance for a cover of 15 lacs. I have had this policy for 20 years, give or take. \n\nI had a medical condition which required surgical intervention back in February this year. I happened to find a surgeon (on a subreddit for the very same condition I had, ironically) so I decided to go visit. I really liked him and he quoted me approximately 6-7 lakhs in total. Both for the surgeon fee and the hospital stay. Despite the seemingly high fee, I was keen on getting this done because he seemed like he was very familiar with my condition and also, I really needed to deal with this once and for all, and so I agreed. \n\nI submitted an application for a total claim of a little over 7 lakhs. The insurance TPA made me run around a LOT during their process of reimbursement, and about 2 weeks ago, they informed me that they will only be reimbursing 3 lakhs from the total claim amount. On paper, they have written my claim is “beyond the limit” for my condition. And my insurance agent on the phone tells me that the TPA spoke to other hospitals and believe I was overcharged. I have immediately raised an appeal with them to which they haven’t responded. It has been two weeks. \n\nThis is absolutely gut-wrenching and I am just not in a position to write off 4 lakhs that I paid out of pocket for. Shouldn’t I have the right to choose the doctor and hospital I feel comfortable with? My claim amount is not even half of my cover, so what is even the point of paying these premiums? I am feeling cheated, and fucked over. I am gonna fight this, but I just don’t know how. I would love whatever help I can get from this sub. Thank you!\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for taking the time out to respond in such detail. I’ll quickly respond to some of the common comments in this thread:\n- the hospital didn’t have a cashless agreement with my insurance provider but my surgeon only works out of Breach Candy. So I didn’t have a choice really. \n- I did in fact speak to my insurance agent before going ahead with the treatment. They asked for a certificate from the surgeon stating my condition and upon submitting that, they gave me the go ahead for the surgery. \n- I chose a room well within the cap on room tariff mentioned in my policy doc. \n- I was not aware that there is a cap on each kind of treatment but I am yet to read the insurance policy in detail. \n- I actually did undergo a less invasive treatment for my condition back in October. And it was a 2 month process that didn’t help at all, so this surgeon was actually my second opinion and he is definitely the best option I had available in Bombay. In fact, it has been 4 months since my surgery and I am finally healed!",

        "text": "Hi,\n\nMy wife and I have been married for a month and a half. Although we’ve loved each other for the past six years, we've been constantly fighting and making up. Her parents always get involved in our fights. Recently, during an argument, her father attacked me by slapping my face and hitting my head five times. He also verbally abused me with curse words. I didn’t fight back because they were recording the incident. When I returned to address it, they forced my wife to leave our home and moved her to a new PG.\n\nHow should I handle this?\n\n**Update:**\n\nA month ago, my wife and I had a heated argument, and her father, as usual, tried to interfere. She has a close colleague with whom she started sharing personal marital issues after our marriage. I confronted her about this and warned her not to do it again.\n\nA week ago, she went to her parents' home without informing me and stayed there for a week. When she returned, she started behaving strangely and laid out conditions for continuing our life together:\n\n1. She doesn't want to come to my mother's house because she feels unsafe and uncomfortable there.\n2. She doesn't want to contribute her earnings to our household expenses. She wants me to take care of her financially, even though I already am. She earns more than me and sends all her money to her parents.\n3. She wants the freedom to go to her parents' home anytime she likes, even if we have other plans as a couple.\n4. She wants us to visit our respective homes separately.\n\nIf I don't agree to these conditions, she threatened to leave.\n\nHer father never wanted us to be together since it’s a love marriage, and I’m not the son-in-law he wanted. He called me names like \"rascal.\" I told him that if he gave respect, I would reciprocate.\n\nSuddenly, he started attacking me, accusing me of wanting his daughter’s salary and saying she was cheating. He slapped my face and hit my head five times. My wife held him back from attacking further. I told him to step aside, acknowledging his age, and said that otherwise, I could have thrashed him.\n\nHer mother accused me of abusing my wife and wanting dowry, even though I have never taken a penny or any gifts. Her father told my wife to reject me and start packing her things.\n\nMy wife returned to me, crying, and asked if she should leave. I remained silent, and she left with her parents. Later, she called me, saying she wanted to continue our relationship because she loves me. I told her to stay with her father. She’s now asking for another chance to build our life together, but her father hasn’t apologized.\n\n\n**Update 2:**\n\nAs a Muslim, we had a religious ceremony and registered in Jamath. but have not yet legally registered our marriage due to work constraints, though we plan to do so this week.\n\nWhen my father heard about this incident, he informed my father-in-law that he would file a case against him.\n\nIn defence, my wife threatened to file charges of assault, harassment, domestic violence and dowry  case against me if any case is filed against her father.\n\nCan she legally file a case against me? I would appreciate your advice on this matter.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if there are any additional details you'd like to include or any adjustments you'd like to make.",

We clearly spoke of US$250 base pay and 10% commissions on cash collected.\n\nShe agreed to pay me the base after 2 weeks trial if we go on for a longer period and I started working based on this agreement.

Inspite of that, her marketing agency guy told me I'm not doing enough.\n\nWhen I told them it's not possible to work such long hours, she started being rude to me and pointing out mistakes in my work. When I told her to be respectful and politely showed her that she was also making the same mistakes which are human errors when you're working with such large volumes, she became even more rude.\n\nFinally on Sept 19, she fired me saying that it's not working out for the business. During this time, I made business worth AUD 16,500 for her which she would be collecting over 8 weeks.\n\nShe owes me AUD 1650 plus USD 125 and has only paid me AUD 248 saying this is all she owes as commission for the first installment.\n\nShe is not responding to my messages and has now blocked me on insta so I cannot connect with her in any way.\n\nThe day she fired me, she put up a post saying I'm the 8th person she fired and I realised that she's done the same thing with two of my friends as well.\n\nShe hires people from India and Nigeria and other third world countries, treats them like dirt, speaks rudely and fires them before payday and doesn't enter into any contracts to save herself.\n\nI have tried complaining about her to fair work ombudsman but cannot do so because of a technical error in the website which I have highlighted to them.\n\nI don't know what to do about this legally as it might take a lot more time and money than what she owes me and there is no guarantee of getting it back so I am posting it here and hoping no one else falls prey to her.  \n",

I got a lot of great suggestions and I wanted to share what worked for me.\n\nThe most common advice was to beat the snot out of him. Tempting as this was, it wasn't going to solve my problem. I could even face charges for assault, or worse, a bunch of chhapris out for revenge.\n\nThe next popular advice was to file a formal complaint on [indiapost.gov.in](https://indiapost.gov.in). I almost went this route, but then I decided to give it one more shot.\n\nI went to the Police station where the verification had happened. The person whom I had met earlier was surprised at this. He suggested maybe the guy was looking for some chai-pani. After I explained the situation to him, he told me that my address is verified by the Police, and saying that it is incomplete is a pretty big claim. He called his contact in the Post Office and told him to hand me the passport the next time I'm there.\n\n**Today** \\- I received an SMS saying my passport has been dispatched again and went to the post office. This time, it is a completely different vibe. Our Hero greets me with a smile and asks me to wait while he looks for my package. Even addresses me as \"Sir\". Then he proceeds to hand me my package while politely requesting to get the address updated (he's still not convinced it's the correct address)\n\n**TLDR:** Took a lot of running, but I finally managed to get my passport.

His staff is known for extorting money in the town to deliver result in their favour. Judge also threatened the police officer of retirement who phone called him when was not in his chamber (non working time).

She started to message me, and I simple played along with some basic pickup line. But this suddenly took a turn as she got pretty obsessed. She would start spamming me with msgs if I didn’t reply and started to beg for my number and instagram id. Me being a bored fool, started teasing her with lines like ‘What would we do once I give ya my insta id’ I was just tryna be be flirty n funny but I had no intention to give or take anything from her. She then one day messaged me saying I’m coming to this place and I want you to come there don’t be late, I started to find her craziness funny and replied to her saying ‘What will we do once I come there ?’. Ik I should have blocked her at tht instant but my dumbass was just too bored n was looking to fuck around. She then told me ull find out, after a while she messaged me saying I’m here and I just told her sorry I can’t come maybe later. She then got veryyy pissed and started cussing at me. Then she proceeded to threaten me to export me to the police for harrassing a minor sexually ( her acc said she was 18 ). I got scared and unmatched her on hinge, in fact I realized my stupidity and deleted my hinge acc. After a while she followed me on insta, and the moment I got the notification and blocked her account.\n\nI’m really scared that if she complains to the police about this vile accusation and my whole life gets fucked up because of this.",

        "title": "Wife asking for divorce and 65 lakh rupees after just 9 months of marriage threatening with fake dowry and dv case.",
        "text": "I originally shared my story here: https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceIndia/s/lKjSTN4I2n. One detail I did not mention is that I work in the UAE but am an Indian citizen.\n\nSince then, things have taken a serious turn for the worse. This incident began in August while I was in India, and my wife was at her home in Chhattisgarh. An argument between us escalated, and my patience ran out. Realizing the severity of the situation, I asked her to involve her parents so we could attempt to salvage the marriage.\n\nHowever, her father refused to come and instead requested a one-month cooling-off period, to which we agreed. In October, when I had returned to the UAE, she called me to discuss the next steps. I told her that the situation had deteriorated significantly between us and our families, and I felt it was best to discuss matters with both families present rather than handling it alone.\n\nFor context, she has a history of multiple relationships and admitted to me that she continued texting one of those men after our marriage. Many of her male friends were either former romantic interests or individuals who had pursued her, a fact she openly confessed.\n\nShe suggested that I come to India in two weeks, and she and her family would visit my home to discuss the matter. I agreed. However, just two days later, she called from the Indian airport, stating she was coming to the UAE instead. When I confronted her about breaking our agreement to discuss matters with our families first, she accused me of wrongdoing and made baseless allegations. Suspecting ulterior motives, I canceled her visa and told her not to come to the UAE for both our sakes. I feared that any confrontation in the UAE could have unforeseen legal consequences, especially if the police got involved.\n\nHer father then began threatening me, accusing me of abandoning her after supposedly inviting her to the UAE, which I never did. I have a full recording of that conversation, which proves I never suggested she come to the UAE.\n\nCurrent Situation\n\nRecently, her father and some relatives visited my family. The meeting quickly turned hostile, with her father accusing my parents of mistreatment. He also objected to me recording conversations with my wife, even though I only did so because she had verbally abused my mother and sister and threatened me with false cases. He further alleged that we tortured his daughter, even though she only lived with my parents for 20 days in total.\n\nAfter hours of accusations, her father stated that his daughter no longer wished to continue the marriage and demanded a divorce. We agreed and asked them to provide their compensation demands. They requested a few days to prepare a list.\n\nTwo weeks later, without any prior communication, we received a call from the police station, informing us of a complaint filed against us for dowry harassment and domestic violence. The next day, my parents and relatives went to the station, where her family reiterated the same accusations they had made at our home. The police mediated and asked her if she wanted to continue the marriage, to which she clearly said no. The police then instructed both families to decide on financial compensation.\n\nThe following day, her family demanded ₹65 lakhs as compensation. This amount included:\n\t•\tHer salary from the job she left before marriage.\n\t•\tCompensation for a job she declined after marriage because she didn’t want to work in a service-based company.\n\t•\tHer projected salary for the next year.\n\t•\tCosts for the car and fuel they used to attend these meetings.\n\t•\tExpenses for her mother’s ankle injury, which occurred months before our marriage in May.\n\nMy Concerns\n\nI do not have the means to pay such an exorbitant amount. Her family is now threatening to file an FIR and initiate legal action. They have significant influence with the police and local politicians, which puts us at a disadvantage.\n\nFriends and advisors have suggested I avoid returning to India for now. My father is a paraplegic, and my mother is his primary caregiver. If she files cases in Chhattisgarh, it will be nearly impossible for my parents to attend the hearings due to their health and mobility issues.\n\nI have recordings of our conversations, which prove the false nature of her accusations. However, I am unsure if these will be admissible as evidence in court.\n\nEmotional and Legal Struggles\n\nThis entire ordeal has left me deeply stressed. It pains me to see my parents, who have always been supportive, suffer because of this situation. I am overwhelmed by concerns about my career, my parents’ well-being, and the possibility of facing false legal cases. I swear I have never raised a hand against her, and my parents have never mistreated her in any way.\n\nI am desperate to navigate this crisis and find a way to defend myself while ensuring my family’s safety. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.\n",

        "text": "I want to share a harrowing experience my family had with Indigo Airlines at Chennai Airport today. We're in desperate need of advice or assistance, and I hope someone here can help.\n\n**Background:**\n- Our flight was scheduled for 5:10 AM.\n- We arrived at the airport at 3:00 AM, well ahead of time.\n\n**The Nightmare Begins:**\n- My father was asked to undergo a medical checkup by an Indigo airhostess, which ended up taking over an hour.\n- Due to this lengthy checkup, my family missed their initial flight.\n\n**False Hope:**\n- After returning from the medical checkup, they were provided new tickets for a 7:20 AM flight.\n- Shockingly, before this flight, they were subjected to another medical checkup, causing them to miss the flight once again.\n\n**Uncooperative Staff:**\n- The Indigo staff at Chennai Airport, specifically named Lavanya, Geeta, and Gobi Prasad, have been extremely uncooperative and refuse to communicate with us.\n- We even attempted to speak with the airport manager, who was outright rude and dismissive, stating that it's \"not his business.\"\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- My family is now stranded at Chennai Airport with no accommodation or assistance.\n- Indigo Airlines is claiming that all flights are packed and they cannot provide an alternative.\n\nWe're feeling helpless and frustrated, not knowing what to do next. Has anyone else faced such a situation with Indigo or any airline? Any advice or contacts that could help us in this dire situation would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading and your support.\n\nEdit 1 : people asking why my father was asked to do a check up at the airport \n\nMy father underwent dialysis a few days back , so he had his arm bandaged . The indigo crew saw it when we were collecting boarding passes and advised us to go do a check up even after we said that we have the written fit to fly approval from the speciality hospital and showed them the same . They only measured his BP and told us it was low ( even though he's a high pressure patient) which somehow took more than an hour . They didn't allow my sister who's a doctor herself to go with my father and took him to the company doctor's room and made him sit there for no reason at all for around 45 mins before checking his BP. This same thing happened to us both the time which led to us missing the 2nd flight as well.\n\nEdit 2 : we have received several phone calls from Indigo Airlines representatives after filing a complaint on the airsewa portal. During these calls, we were repeatedly told that my father was not fit to travel despite having the fit to fly approval from the speciality hospital. When we requested clarification or asked for the reasons behind this decision, the calls were either abruptly terminated with the claim of \"you are not audible\" or the promise that someone would follow up, which has not occurred in any case. Here's the [tweet](https://twitter.com/_pradpt/status/1700393361386168521?t=pGWT2qhp5lpKp0pem3dBMg&s=19) I had made earlier if anyone wants to RT it\n\n\nEdit 3 : Got a call with the Indigo corporate office in Gurugram, Haryana. They reiterated that my father was not fit to fly today. We asked them why they issued tickets for the 7:20 am flight and why the need for a second checkup. If he was deemed unfit at 5:10 am, it raised questions about his fitness two hours later. Moreover, we inquired about the extensive time it took for a simple blood pressure check, which lasted over an hour. When we questioned this inconsistency, they assured us of an inquiry but failed to provide satisfactory answers. Instead , they told us they can give us a ticket for tomorrow at 5:10 am for free as a \"goodwill gesture\". When I questioned how they could be certain he'd be fit tomorrow when he wasn't today and inquired about the compensation or accommodation as per the DGCA guidelines , they just told us \"our company doctor told us so, but we'll not be able to provide any compensation for the ordeal due to company policies\"",

For the past 2-3 years, my wife has been cheating on me.All this happened when I used to leave for work and she lived alone here in India. She used to give my mom sleeping pills, and then her partner used to come to my house. This was revealed to me when a neighbour (a friend) sent me a video asking, \"Do you know this guy?\"He frequently comes to your house\". I was broken into pieces. I began looking for evidence without acting emotionally.I discovered that guy's Instagram account, and my female friend assisted me in communicating with him using a fake ID. I made him confess how all this was happening, how they met, how many times they had a physical thing, and he also sent me( to the fake ID) my wife's pictures and some of her bold pics when I forced that I wanted to see her. He also confessed that my wife's plan was to kill me at some point when she would be fully satisfied. I have the screen recording of all those chats and video calls, which clearly shows his face and his voice. The whole colony is an eyewitness to him hanging around my house every night.\n\n* HELP\n\nAll I want is to get rid of her having custody of my son. The house is half in my name and half in my mother's name and that is the only asset i got. How can I protect the house, and will she seek alimony if I file for divorce? If yes, how can I escape it? It's clearly her fault, and moreover, she's ruined my life and my son's life.\n\nJust ask in the comments of you have further queries or need more info\n\nEDIT :  Thanks for the support, Gyz, even though it is virtual; it meant a lot to me. I'll begin my search for a good lawyer as you have suggested. I don't know how many men go through this situation in life because of these biassed laws. We move to other places to earn something for the betterment of our families, leaving our parents and our luxurious life behind going to bed by just having chai and bread, and this is what we get. For the women out there who support their families and are loyal to them, I have a huge respect for you ladies; you are the rarest of the rare. ",

What's worse is that this kid was transporting a package as a part of his responsibility at his job, he was actually a smart college-going lad.It's very likely that he might be acquitted of the charges, but the trial has not even started in all these years.\n\nThe NDPS Act straight out puts a bar on bail in such cases, and with how the legal system (trial court) works in this country, you could remain in jail for more than half of the maximum punishment period as an 'undertrial' person, not even a convict.\n\nThere is also this concept of 'constructive possession' where even if the narcotics aren't in your possession when you're caught, you have power and control over the narcotics and that muddies the water quite a bit.\n\nKids these days seem to be very nonchalant about drugs and narcotics, with little regard for safety or privacy. Know that a few hours of high can ruin your life for good. The legal system will ruin your life far more than any narcotics ever could.\n\nSure, a lot of people might dismiss this by saying 'don't get caught' or 'just pay off the cops', but that's just you getting lucky.

I'll beat you etc etc. Literally threatening me standing so close to me. \nI was like I'll call the Delhi Police. Two Africans ganged up and were telling me \"call the police lets see what they do. You are studpid if you don't call them. You're just like a mosquito over here. You can't do anything\" .\nThe bhayas over there stepped in saying ma'am just ignore them, these people are like that.

        "text": "Hi guys,\n\nI(38M) from Pune, rented my flat to a person who is divorcee. We later realized he is living there alone instead of with his parents which he pretended to be a permanent thing. He has kept the flat in s super dirty condition.\n\nNow our legal rent agreement ended in Nov 2024. We intend to sell the flat, this guy has kept the house in bad condition so we cannot show the flat to buyer in that condition. We have been requesting the tenant to empty the flat so they we can paint it and try to sell it. But the tenant is super rude and hameless says he will leave the flat only when he finds a sufficiently good flat. No dates nothing. We as simple people tried to send him the No broker listings, and helped him with broker too. But he is still not ready to leave. \n\nOnce we had some heated argument, he said do what you want to do. Worst part is he has kept paying rent regularly and I have no idea ho to evect the guy. \n\nNeed to evict hime asap, as we have buyers for the house, need to sell the flat as soon as possible due to financial need.\n\nI read lot of posts in this sub and others too, I realized going legal route sending notice, getting eviction notice etc will take years... Being a simple and (yes I accept this) cowrd man, I cannot just take few goons and throw him away... \n\nWhat are my chances, how can I get rid of this person? I am afraid if he files a police case against me for any reason shouldn't affect my job which is in a reputed IT firm.\n\nAny help and advice to get rid of this person asap will be helpful.",

It took me time to realise what I have just read, and then I saw that it was showing 777 and then finally hit me that maybe I have actually won something.\n\nLooking at what I was even playing for, I realised it was a tech bundle of a MacBook, iPad, and AirPod Max and Bag worth ₹ 3 Lakh\n\nI went into the voucher section of the app, and it showed me exactly what I won, and from there, the claim reward button took me to a page where they asked me all my personal details to send me the reward, as well as my PAN card image so that they can file for TDS on the Gift Reward.\n\nToday morning, I got a call from CRED support where they said that I have won because of a bug inside the app and because of this they are cancelling the whole jackpot itself, and as a goodwill gesture, they are giving me a cashback of ₹1K.\n\nI don’t know how this can be legal. They have removed the voucher from the app now, but I have all the screenshots with me.\n\nPosted on Twitter: https://x.com/_jaikathuria/status/1832317371345760530?s=46",

So we had a fight and i decided to break up.\n\nI came to know recently that this ex-girlfriend of mine has a boyfriend from 2022 who she doesn’t want to be with and he has kept her like a slave. This guy had recorded videos of her and told her if she decides to marry off she will leak her videos online and he also took her father’s number from her phone and has miss called several times to keep her scared. This guy is a local goon who has political connections and have been in jail several times in harassment cases as per details i got from ex’s friends, he has been asking her to come to visit his whenever she’s out of house forcefully , she lives far from his house and this he has been doing with several other girls.\n\nShe comes from conservative family and they will probably beat the shit out of her or probably kill her if they came to know about the videos. So she has been acting slave to this guy for almost 3 years.\nShe has a second phone on which this guy calls 24x7 and abuses the shit out of her if she doesn’t pick up his calls, so my ex has developed some sort of trauma due to which she can’t talk to people on phones, she doesn’t talk to him with also , she just shows what’s happening around her on video calls as he wants to know where she’s and she cries all day and self harm all day.\n\nShe’s afraid that police will come to her house and if she files police complaint and her character will be annihilated and he will kill her, if police doesn’t charge him and he walks free. We live in different cities and this guy carries knife and what not with him and whenever he sees some guy brother or relative with her, he warns her in public and takes her with him and beats her.\n\nThis guy doesn’t have any idea she has two phones and she used to text me with other phone as he checks her text messages, call logs etc.\n\ni want to help her but want everything to be done discreetly.\n\nCity- BBSR, Odisha\n\nNeed HELP!!!!\n",

I was a regular patient at her clinic for dental checkup and regular cleaning since 2012 to 2017.\n\nIn 2017 I asked her that I want to get the bleaching done for teeth whitening as I had very mild fluorosis on 1 tooth. She told me bleaching is not a good option and she will apply a paint on my tooth and she told me to get it done from molar to molar otherwise color will be different.\n\nI was really naive and I trusted her recommendation. When she started doing it, she started eroding my teeth which I strongly objected to and yelled to stop. But she didn't care to stop and went on to damage all my front teeth. She intentionally damaged my teeth despite knowing that she is damaging my nerves.\n\nShe misinformed me about the treatment\n, did the wrong treatment, used terrible quality material and ill-treated me when I raised an objection.Because of her misconduct, I lost all enamel and I am not able to eat. Dental bonding is not recommended for teeth whitening because it catches stain but this idiot didn’t even care about reading of a procedure and directly operated on me. I desperately tried to stop her but she didn’t even stop between a treatment.\n\nThroughout the years, I told her about her wrong doings and how much I am suffering but she refused to take any accountability. Because of her actions, I am going through severe nerve damage, monetary loss and mental trauma. When I complained about her misconduct she tried to manipulate the situation and made it look like something else. She refused to take any accountability for it. She has blocked me everywhere so I can’t expose her negligent and pathetic services.\n\nPlease suggest what should I do and how to take a legal action against her?

In a crowd full of 100-200 people, police caught me along with 18 others, took us to the police station and pressed charges against us(IPC 188). I don't even know who these 18 people were because the police just caught whoever they could lay their hands on in that chaos. I was just 19 y/o back then. I wasn't even aware that the police had imposed section 144 in that area, otherwise I wouldn't even go. Some random lawyer is fighting our case and I don't even know who this guy is, I've never met him. He took up our case because he knows someone from the 18 people involved in the case\n\nIn Sept 2022, the state govt issued a gazette asking the courts to dismiss all criminal charges against those arrested during these protests. However, my case remains pending on an unready board in the district court for the past 3.8 years, we just keep getting hearing dates. I'm not even able to prove my innocence.\n\nThis year, I graduated and I've been actively looking for jobs. Even if I get hired, I'm scared a BGV might jeopardize it. The pending case will pop up, and I'll be fired/my offer will be revoked. I don't know how to deal with this problem. I'm eager to start working and provide for my family, but securing a job seems extremely challenging. Will the company even consider hiring me despite my pending legal case? How do I go forward with this?

He canceled the wedding just a few days before the event (after all the prep and inviting people etc). This has caused a lot of grief to me and my family. If the guy would have mentioned this even a couple of months ago, it would have been fine, but the fact that he waited till the last minute to make a decision makes my blood boil. We are at a loss as to why he did this. To give some details \nThe guy works in a reputed company in US. \nHe and my sister got engaged in November of last year. We have proof of the event, pictures etc. We have the wedding card etc as proof too. Not sure what can be done here and what proofs are needed for this. \nPlease advise. \nThank you \n\nPS:\n\nFolks, I don’t want to file any false case against him. He didn’t ask for dowry, and I wouldn’t do that. But yes, there is trauma he has caused us by the way he has handled things. And I wanted him to understand that what he did is not right. \nBacking out is fine as long as it doesn’t come at a huge cost financial, emotional. I have spent close to 10L for the wedding prep. They wanted a grand engagement and we obliged. Sangeeth, done. Clothes to be given. Big wedding hall, done. No expenses were split. \n\nWe are all humans after all and playing with people’s emotions is not right. Which is what this post is for. To understand what laws are present in such scenarios and what can be done. Not to file false cases or destroy someone’s life. \nI thank anyone who has responded with any relevant information.\n✌🏾 ",

The repairman was already present at the police station, and we showed the police the bills for the repair. The repairman then confessed to installing the stolen motherboard.\nThe police realized their mistake and apologized, saying it was a misunderstanding.

We thought the ordeal was over, but it worsened when some of the police officers got drunk and started beating us again with slippers. They blamed us for not opening the gate and claimed it was our mistake.\nSome of our friends gathered outside the police station to rescue us, and the police eventually released us at 1 a.m. They told us to return the next morning at 10 a.m.\nIdk what should we do or how can we take action against them, our only mistake is that he didn't open the door.",

        "title": "M29- I was involved in a bike accident in which a pedestrian (yet unidentified) was fatally injured- looking for advice",
        "text": "Hello everyone, I will try to share my experience as a story, so that the chronology is clear. \n\nBut before that a rudimentary intro: I am working professional, staying in an Indian metro and an immigrant to the city, who doesn't know the local language. My office is about 20 Km from my residence, and every office day I get to office on my bike- a 350 cc Royal Enfield Hunter.\n\n10.30 AM: I was going from my home to the office. My office generally starts at 9 but this day I had taken permission to be late, and I was ambling to my office on my bike. \n\nThe incident occurred on the first part on the journey only, which is on a state highway with dual lanes for bidirectional one way traffic divided by dividers. \n\nAfter 3-4 Km, in a situation on the road arose that I was tailing two cars, one on the left, slower lane, and one on the right faster lane. The car on the slower lane, which was doing around 50, slowly started braking to maybe a 20-30, and seeing this, instinctively I went for an overtake of the slower vehicle on the left lane.\n\nAs soon as I had revved my bike for the overtake and got in lane to complete it, I saw that a old man, who was walking using a stick, had emerged from the front of the slowing car, at a distance of about 20 metres. I immediately honked and slammed my brakes at full, which made my tyres wobble to the point of skidding. However, as I have ABS, the brakes locked in, and at about 5-10 metres distance, the wheels start rolling again at a speed of maybe 20-30. all this while I had been honking and even screaming continuously, and though the entire episode was only 2-3 seconds long, not once did the old guy look up. Moreover, as he was leaning forward with his stick, he was casting a significantly larger projection of his body in his path.\n\nSo then the inevitable happened, I tried my level best to avoid him by swerving right aggressively, but couldn't, and slammed into the guy, albeit at and angle and a side. I flew away, and my bike dragged itself away further. \n\nAfter I got up, I saw I had minor injuries only, and people around started swarming. I ran up to the guy, and saw the guy was almost still, which made me terrified, as I had already realised this was the hardest collision I have ever had in my life, I have had only 2-3 proper collisions in my 12 years of biking, and this was the hardest.\nI was helped by another guy to pick up my bike and park it on the side to clear the road for the traffic. At this moment, i had about a 5-10 sec window where I could've run, but I first considered the fact that my bike had had a crash, I wasn't really sure about it's condition, and if i was chased down, then i would be beat up publicly. Moreover in my heart i knew that it wasn't my fault, and I was concerned for the guy too, so I decided in that moment to do things by the book.\n\nThe guy was carried to the side of the road, where it was fortunately concluded that he was alive, just that he was injured gravely, had a broken leg, bleeding on the temple, and was badly drunk, to the point he was not able to answer anything. Now I'll take a moment to describe the person, he was around 60ish, and from his appearance it was clear that he was really poor, if not a street dweller. The stick he carried was because he had already broken his other leg before, which had healed badly and was visible. The people of the locality had never seen the person ever, and he could neither provide a name or address or anything of that sort.\n\n10.45 AM: Someone from the crowd had already called 100, and an ambulance arrived. The ambulance staff got down, took a photo of my bike, and asked me to accompany the victim. The victim at this point, was drunk so much, that he had to be physically forced by the ambulance staff to stay inside the ambulance, but he could speak nothing. I tried to negotiate with the ambulance staff to take him directly to the hospital, but they insisted that as it was a accident case and 100 dial, they didn't have an option other than the PS.\n\n\n11.15 AM: The ambulance staff took us first to the nearest PS. I went into the PS, where my details were taken, and my bike key was detained from me. The police, which i got to know retrospectively, didn't register a case then, as there was no one from the victim's side. I had called some colleagues to be there to back me up.at the PS, one of my colleague's elder brother, let's call him X as he's relevant to the story, who is also a police officer at another adjoining PS, also comes to help me out. The police decree that I was responsible for the treatment, and after discussions on wether to admit him in a state hospital or private hospital, I chose the first option as it was obviously, cheaper.\n\n12.30 PM: I arrived at the hospital in the ambulance with the victim, and was soon joined by 2 other police officers. Over the rest of the day, I wheeled the stretcher around the hell that is the biggest goverment hospital in any metro, for various tests, plasters etc etc. I even assisted doctors in procedures as they had no staff, got drenched in the guy's blood even at one point during the ICT. \n\n8.00 PM: after this long cursed day, I turned back to go home at around 8. The guy's injuries were more serious than it initially looked, he had a broken rib which had caused a pleural effusion which had to be drained, and he had skill fractures, in addition to his now plastered broken leg. The guy was practically a malnutritioned street dweller and drunkard, and his body was already frail and weak, even before the accident, and this had him hard. But even now, no details to identity or address.\n\nAll this while, X was primarily guiding me and liasoning with the police for me, and was very helpful to my panicked self, telling me what to do. While returning, X told me to send him 15k, and told me that if the guy survives this would be enough, however, if not, the tab will rise.\n\n\n-Break-\n\nOver the next 3-4 days, I had to visit the hospital everyday to check up on the guy whose condition kept detoriating. As a government hospital, it is mandated that every patient is required to have an attendant (friend or family) or at least someone 24*7. As the primary contact, the hospital staff expected me to stay 24*7, which was not possible for me. To achieve this, this required a 2nd round of bribes to the police officers who were stationed at the hospital, which was relatively lesser, and not too relevant to the final outcome. All this while, there was no update on the guy's identity.\n\nYesterday 10.30 AM: I was informed that the victim had expired. I immediately went to the hospital, didn't get to see the body but the victim is gone. The hospital and I both informed the PS of the situation. The SI told me to come back home and report in the evening to the PS.\n\nIn the PS, I was accompanied by X, and 2 other colleagues and my gf to back me up. Our efforts were primarily to try that the case is not registered as there are no next of kin of the victim, and most probably won't be, as he looked like a street dweller. However, the police told me that they had to file a case as a person was dead, unnamed he may be, but if in the near future, any next of kin arrives, he would lose his job and I'll go to jail. So, as X had already talked about it, I was told to fill in all my details, including family details, on a form 41 (a)? for station bail, and signed on it. Apparently, a police person also compiled a petition in my case, but no official statement was taken from me yesterday. I was told I was free to go, my vehicle would be released after the completion of the post mortem in 2 days. X says that I need to pay some more, which is expected, but I don't know how much, and I still haven't paid him anything extra yet. But I will have to pay him soon. No details on the identity of the guy yet. This is the current situation. \n\nEpilogue\n\nSo now I'm an accused in a case under Section 304 A, and out on station bail. According to the police folks, and a few lawyers too I had a chance to speak to, as the guy has no next of kin or someone to fight for him, the case will be closed automatically after 3 hearings when and if, no one shows up from his side.\n\nIf this case goes to court, I have a photo of his initial admission report which has it clearly written that he was under the influence of alcohol. Additionally, he was on a state highway, no zebra crossings, and I wasn't going at lightning speeds beyond 90-100 or something, it was conventional speed. I think even if the case goes to trial, maybe I have a strong case. Moreover, I have a good 3rd party insurance which should cover accidental compensation if the next of kin shows up.\n\n\n\nSo now guys, you must have realised that these days have been living hell for me, and I'm too tired to decide which is the correct thing to do, so tell me, in how much trouble I am now, what should I do next, what could possibly go wrong, how to ensure nothing goes wrong, and most importantly, what next???",

Raise a formal complaint with the other party via e-mail.\n2. If that does not resolve your issue, file a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (**NCH**) via 1915, Umang App, or the NCH app.\n3. NCH escalates the complaint directly to the grievance officer of the accused company, who is required to respond to the complaint within a stipulated time period.\n\nIf your dispute amount is small, i.e., around ₹10,000, filing an NCH complaint might resolve your issue and save you the trouble of going to a lawyer.\n\nIt is important to note that following the abovementioned practices will increase your chances of getting a redressal without going to court. If you do not get a redressal, the abovementioned will create a paper trail for your lawyer to add as a reference to your complaint. The same may benefit you in the court.",

        "text": "37M here, want to divorce my wife 34F. Been married for 3 years. Both are at similar position in tech and earn almost same salary. I pay house rent (45k) and my wife handles cook and maid salary (8k). \n\n(Some background) Marriage has been bumpy and I feel it's due to my wife's neurotic behaviour - getting offended in every small things, shouting if things don't turn out well, always dominating. Everytime we fight she would call her parents and exaggerate the situation. Then her parents call my parents and when my parents come to alleviate the situation she would blame them that they are destroying our marriage. There is no physical abuse or monetary problems. \n\nHowever things improved somewhat and we didn't fight for 5 months straight - I would basically agree to whatever she wanted and it was going ok. But issue started when my parents came to visit. She told me if my parents come to our house she would go somewhere else as she is not ok with them. So my parents decided to stay at some other place despite being in my city and travelling here from far. But I felt it's too disrespectful and I called them to stay with us for last 2 days of them being in the city. Now she has started behaving weirdly and not talking to anyone. (Background ends)\n\nI am sick and tired of this and feel I am wasting time with this person. As a man, what are my options? I would want to stay separately ( married or not) so that I can reclaim my mental peace. Should I go for divorce first and then live separately or should I get live separately and then file for divorce? What are your thoughts? \n\n\nEdit (legal question below)-\n\nI am unsure if there is a difference - does living separately for let's say 6 months ensure swift divorce or if we immediately file for divorce will the court deny it at first and ask us to mend things? How to ensure smooth process here is the question.",

        "text": "Hi, everyone. \n\nAround a week ago, I started getting messages from different men asking if I was a certain name (and this name is a nickname some people use for me. A shortened version of my full name). When I asked how they got my number, they said it was on a \"sexy website\". Some asked for nudes, some tried to call, some asked to video chat. I managed to get one of them to send me a screenshot of where they found my number, and I was able to find the page. It's a porn video and in the comment section, it says \"Call me <my number>\" and the name of the commenter was my nickname.\n\nThe first thing I did was to write a comment under it saying anyone who's been calling the number has been getting reported to the police, so don't call it.\n\nI then wrote to the website owner asking for it to be taken down. It's been 24 hours and nothing has happened, so I wrote to Bengaluru Cyber Crime Police, Namecheap and Cloudflare.\n\nI don't want to have to change my number. I'm hoping this dies down.\n\nMy main question is, is there any possibility this could have been a bot? I don't want to think that it's someone I know. There are so many scenarios going through my head of who might have done this; from people I know to random people I've interacted with: delivery persons, taxi/auto drivers, etc.\n\nManaging to get the IP address of the person who did this would be a task as well, but is there a legal procedure through which I can do so, and is it worth the hassle?\n\nDoes anyone know of this happening to anyone else recently? Any advice/insight about what steps to take would be greatly appreciated.\n\n#**EDIT**\n\n\nThank you so much, everyone, for all your very kind messages and advice. I didn't want to think it was someone I know, and was hoping this is a new bot scam. But every single comment is telling me it most likely is someone known to me and bots don't work this way.\n\nThis information is very troubling and has disturbed me; the calls could have easily been dealt with by just changing numbers or getting the page taken down (which I have contacted the domain registrar and webhosts about). The messages have been very sporadic for a few days and hopefully will completely stop.\n\nRegarding the cyber crime police, I've been reading that it's very hard to get them to take action. I don't have the energy to follow this through (unless it escalates/is done again, in which case I will lodge another complaint at the station). I know I might not ever find out who it was, although I do have a little hunch about who it might be. Here's hoping nothing further happens. \n\nI'm also sorry about the other people this has happened to and hope you're all doing well.",

We had found the place on Instagram we decided to go for it. We had booked a camping tent, might be off season so there weren't many people there, just me and my friend and 1 more group. Since we had taken a camp we had requested the staff for hot water, one of the staff members offered us a washroom in one of the room which had showered and we agreed. When my friend went to shower, I was waiting in the lawn area for her. The guy with a smile on his face took a ladder and went behind the room, I followed him to find out that he was recording my friend through the window. When confronted he denied and immediately deleted the video, smiling infront of me, the staff at that time said that they were firing him but I guess he has been taken back. It is shameful that young staff like there was, can't seem to understand that this could happen to their daughter, sister, mother or girlfriend. I wish we had taken some extreme measures at that time, to be honest couldn't really process it. It's disheartening that even after years, the thought still haunts us, can't travel anywhere in peace. Please write review about them on Google so that others can be aware about this as well, and what are the steps which we can take now? I know it's too late but still. ",

I told him about one incident happened to me where I invested around 65 lacs rupees. And that company ran away. And didn't return my investment. And for all that I had taken loam only. \nSo my EMIs were very huge. It was getting difficult to manage. \n\nThen he told he is doing one investment from last 2 years. And that person is giving return upto 5-7% every month. I told him I can't take risks as my EMIs are already huge. If I take loans it will be very difficult. He gave me assurance don't worry. I am doing it from last two years. And he told don't worry. And if they didn't pay he will pay me. And he gave me one blank cheque as well. So I invested 3 lacs first and he was giving return regularly for 2-3 months. After that I loan instant loan option.\nAs he is from Bangalore and I wanted to start something in Bangalore.\nOne day he told me he is planning to open one franchise of one famous restaurant. I thought as he is from Bangalore. It will be good to take local support. So I thought to invest.\nSo we decided to invest 8 lacs each. \nI took money from me and he told he had given for franchise fee and shop advance.\nI agreed. And 5 lacs I given him for franchise and 3 lacs he asked for his brother. As his brother needed money. So I gave him 3 lacs for his brother.\n\nOne day he told me he got one very good deal. Where he will get upto 8% returns monthly. He again convinced me. Because of previous incidents where company ran away. I was not getting ready. I told him. Brother I am in very bad condition if something happened. My life will be ruined. He told don't worry. He is also getting cheques from the person where he invest money. I agreed and I took topup loans upto 27 lacs. \n\nAs I had I my mind that, with this money I eill able to manage previous as well as current EMIs. And I will able to save some portion of my salary.\n\nSo total amount I given him is around 38 lacs.\n\nHe gave me profit for few months. Post that he started making excuses that the person is out of station and all.\nI got suspicious as he was not doing anything about franchise as well.\nThen one day I called landlord and came to know that he hadn't given any money to him. \nAs I don't know kannada( I am from North India), he was dealing with all this. Then I came to know he hasn't given money anywhere. No franchisee fee, no rent advance. I got shock.\n\nFrom November 2023 I am keep asking money. He is saying, don't worry he will give money. But he is not giving money. He is saying that third party hasn't given him and all. \nAnd he has also told me don't worry, he has one plot he will sell and give my money back.\n\nI am keep following him. He is not giving money.\n\nHe gave one date to pay 15 lacs. Since he is not taking any action or not telling any plan. \nSo I don't think he will pay me.\n\nI am thinking to file one FIR or send him a legal notice.\nSince he has given me one blank cheque as well. So I am thinking to deposit that cheque with my amount and in case of cheque bounce I will file a court case. \n\nPlease suggest what should I do?\nFIR?\nLegal Notice?\nCheque bounce?\nOr should wait more?\n\nSorry for the long post.

She blocked him and recently, two of her friends from her hometown told her the same but never disclosed the name of the group or who send it to them. So, they were a bit concerned, but did let go of it thinking it might be someone else.\nTthis morning, a mutual friend of ours told her directly that he saw some pictures of her in a telegram group called 'Kulasthree'. Apparently the post had her photos with my friend (25M) which arent nudes but decent ones they took but never posted it in the public domain. Along with those, these is some faceless nudes and her phone number as an album of some sort. He sent her a screenshot of the same and everyone is blaming my friend, except her. They are in this together and my friend assures her 100% that the pics didn't leak from his devices and he never showed, or send those to anyone. She believes him and the news has spread in our friend circle like wildfire and the guy who sent her the screenshot directly is refusing us to share more info about the telegram group he found and he isn't saying who forwarded the pictures into the group, because the group is a small knit group with his friends from the armed forces including his superiors. \n\nI've asked them to move legally and surprisingly she's holding up well or maybe she hasnt reached her breaking point yet. But my friend is devastated since everyone is blaming him.\n\nCan someone suggest the legal procedures to address the issue, ensuring their anonymity and safety? Is there any way to not proceed through the local police station? The boomer officials will slutshame her for taking the pictures in the first place!",

I asked the policeman wasn't her son arrested he said yes he was arrested for a non bailable case. I didn't pry much. Anyways the policemen said something in the line of not believing that she cooked. They said that since the allegations are serious since rape is involved it can't be done with so quickly. \n\nSo they took our names and all.

While going through my gallery, they found some old photos of weed in a hidden folder (these were years old and had no connection to anything happening now).\n\nThey claimed we could be jailed just for having those pictures. They then took us to the lockup, physically assaulted us, and intimidated us for hours. Eventually, we had to pay 50,000 INR (split between me and my friend) to be released. Even after paying, they kept my phone, keys, and vehicle.\n\nI feel completely violated and shaken up. I’ve heard that possessing pictures isn’t a crime, especially if they’re old and unrelated to any activity.\n\t•\tWas what the police did legal?\n\t•\tCan they really arrest or detain someone based on old photos found on their phone?\n\t•\tDo I have any recourse to get my property back or report this abuse?\n\nI’d really appreciate any legal insights or advice on what I can do in this situation.\n\nThanks.",

We once went to some local hotel and things happened. Later our friendship dissolved and i got in a relationship with someone and about to be engaged. Now this guy has reappeared and constantly texting me , i blocked him from everywhere but now some anonymous calls have started ringing from weird numbers and with different vouces all are threatening me. He himself has not said anythhing like that but calls signified that they have pictures of me. And they would upload them to sites which would harm my personal amd professional image. What can ne done in such a situation. I am really scared. And i am sure that pictures came from him because he is the only one i was with before my supposed fiance.  And i never shared any but he might have clicked some in hotel. No i dont know what pictures are there. Or even if there are any or not\n\n\nPlease help me out",

After my suspension got over they suspended me again for 1 month. They are telling me to sign a legal affidavit on the terms that they will remove my suspension.

Please suggest me some legal advice for what can happen to me and what should I do. They are not letting me give my exams without signing the affidavit which is unfair.\n\nEdit - they are not telling me to sign the affidavit but it is on the behalf of my father which states things like if school takes any action on me. My father or any family member have no right to go against them (school)  or take any legal action. But they are telling my father to sign the affidavit to let me give my exams. They are basically harassing me and my family members now.\nMy school chairman is a very powerful person and made me write the statement by telling “MAI KHOON BHI MAAF KARDUNGA PAR JHOOTH NAHI KARUNGA” and also told me that my one sign will ban you from taking admission in any part of the world and destroy your life.",

        "text": "My grandfather has not been in a proper state of mind since the past two to three years. It was a gradual realisation. He lives by himself in another building in the same area and we have appointed a lady to take care of him. A tiny space (ex-store room) has been taken on rent in the same building by my family for her and her family to stay since she was recently widowed. However this woman has time and again taken advantage of my grandfather’s situation. We once found out that she had gold earrings made for her. Another instance is where some investment money (around 50k) was put in her name. When confronted she was forced to return the gold and the money. Despite this we continued her employment considering that she was desperate. Having two young college going children who had recently been rendered fatherless was obviously very sad we thus we were very empathetic towards them. In hindsight I feel that this was a bad decision.\n\nBut recently we happened to get his passbook printed only to find out that frequent transfers had been made to this maid’s daughter’s UPI id. We were shocked because he can barely use WhatsApp, forget about opening and operating any UPI account. My cousin went over and downloaded G-pay on his phone on my aunt’s instruction. She somehow got access to his account by clicking on forgot password and what not and changing the UPI pin. We then checked his transaction history. Turns out that frequent transfers had been made to the daughter’s UPI id, all of ₹ 5000 or sometimes 4 or 6k and for other things like nail salon, hair salon, spa, etc. Till now we were able to trace transactions of over ₹ 1.2 Lakhs in favour of this person. Also this is only half the story. In the passbook there had been more entries so we are guessing that these transfers were done through alternate UPI apps. We are yet to get his other two bank accounts’ transaction history which we will be doing soon.\n\nShould we approach the police directly or first confront the maid and ask her to return all the money. It’s really depressing cuz it’s sad to see your loved ones being taken for a ride like that by some absolute horrendous natured people with no gratitude whatsoever.",

She started bombarding my company’s helpline office with messages about me “please let me talk to him once”\n\nI got messages from many people from my office that this girl is desperate to talk to you. It was freakin scary. Then she started messaging my colleagues in hope of getting my phone number\n\nI have never seen someone being so relentless even after so many months\n\nI don’t know what to do. Please suggest me what I should do as I know in India anti-stalking laws don’t apply to women",

I denied taking the order because it showed cancelled and also spoke to the swiggy executive who was calling me regarding this. They assured me that no fine would be done but now that I check, I have been levied a fine of 405 rupees and there's no way to contact them. The help system only takes me to the chatbot and helpline is busy. Could anyone suggest what can be done now?\n\n(Update: Thanks a lot for the overwhelming supportive advice guys. I ended up on swiggy instamart's customer service who transferred me to another person and so on. After 5 transfers, finally got in contact with Swiggy's food team who reversed the fine after I threatened them with the consumer court. Sadly the taco did turn cold during the process and my craving for fried chicken remains unsatisfied) ",

        "title": "A Cruel Judge",
        "text": "Hello all. This the story of my sister. She joined as process server in a civil court in andhra pradesh. Initial days the job was good and she was limited to office work, coming home by evening. Everything was going fine. The court has only one judge as it is a lowr court. Six months since joining Everything is going fine.  After 6 months, judge wife and daughter left to hyderabad for the law education of daughter. And the problems started since then. \n\nUntil then my sister was doing only office work. But after his wife and daughter left, judge started ordering her doing work at home as maid. He ordered her to cook, clean at home. My sister did it fearing his position and bad name my father carries at my hometown being drunkard and womanizer. One day he asked my sister to come with him to guntur to work at his family function,  for which she declined. From then it got even worse. One of the officer at court said to her that judge has ranted about her for not working. Saying that \"does she think herself as actress for not to work\" and few castist remarks. He started making her to stay at court even till night.  He made sure that she only leaves only after last bus to my hometown left. Know this she was leaving late at night my dad asked her if he can arrange a car for travel. She declined thinking that process server coming to court in car will only make problems worse. And judge might only allow her to leave late at night. \nDuring this time there was another officer in the court who helped her by droping home to whom she became close and thought as friend.  He is 40 plus though. I am saying this because giving half picture will not solve things. Soon rumours about their relationship started to spread. When asked my sister denied relationship but only sees him as friend. The cause for this is because the judge is making sure she leaves only after last bus left and he is the only one she can rely to get drop.\n\nSoon she got fed up with work and asked judge about this work, only for her suprise, he said that he wanted her to resign so that he can get another person whom he likes as process server. And the tourcher only got worse. He made her clean rooms and mentally abuse in such a way they she started crying all of the sudden. She wokes up from sleep due to nightmares. \n\nI was out of town for the past 6 months when this is happening and only recently got to know about all these. And my immediate reaction was asking her to resign which she complied. I want her to work hard to get another job or do pg. My parents doesn't want her to leave the job now but take LOP till judge transfers, since it is a government job. But for me i want her to leave it and find peace in another jobs. Their another idea is that she doesn't need a job and should get married.\n I am fine with any choise she makes. \n\nThe reason for this post is to ask few things \n1.aren't judges supposed to be protectors of law. How can they behave like this.\n2. Is there a way to get back to the judge legally.  My family fears retaliation from him given his position \n3. I know there are few mistakes made by sister trusting colleagues. But she isn't the kind to do something that shame her. So how cam we dispel these rumors.\nPlease help me, i am struggling with thoughts.  Your answers might help me find a solution and peace. How can i help my sister.  She is scared to doing job",

        "text": "I am a 21-year-old F, and I want to share my story to seek advice and understanding because the pain and injustice my family has endured still haunts me to this day.  \n\nBack in 2012, when I was just 8 years old and my brother was 5, my father passed away under suspicious circumstances which was very traumatizing for us. He was not a great man. He had an extramarital affair, and we suspect his death was either caused by his mistress or someone in his family. My father and grandfather never got along, and their relationship was always strained. Infact , my father wanted to live seperately  because of my grandfather as he used to create fights with my dad and always supported my uncle [chacha]. During my father's funeral ceremony , I saw my grandfather laughing , smiling and there was no sign of sorrow or grief\n\nAfter my father’s death, things became so much worse. My grandfather, grandmother, uncle, and aunt emotionally manipulated my mom into signing ppapers of the businesses that were set up by my dad , the LIC insurance money which was to be transferred to my mom. They fraudulently transferred ownership of everything that rightfully belonged to my mom, me, and my brother. They also took all the money that was ours. Once they secured ownership, they threw us out and left us to fend for ourselves.  \n\nAs if that betrayal wasn’t enough, they pressured my mom into marrying someone else. In this new household, we were mentally abused, and life just kept getting harder for all of us.  \n\nIn 2018, after years of struggle, we filed a fraud case against my grandfather for taking away what was ours. We won the case, but the process of actually getting back what belongs to us has been draining and frustrating. During the execution proceedings, my grandfather and his lawyer conveniently did not show up for most of the hearings. But when it was time for the court to make a decision, his lawyer suddenly appeared and raised objections, which delayed the case further. My mom had to change her lawyer thrice , as all of them were taking money from my grandfather to ruin the case. \n\nWhat hurts the most is that while we are still fighting to get what is rightfully ours, my grandfather and his family are out enjoying life, traveling to places like Singapore. Yet, they still cannot be present for court hearings.  \n\nIt breaks my heart to think about everything my mom, my brother, and I have been through. My mom has been our rock, handling all of this on her own since my father passed away. Despite all the manipulation and abuse, she has fought hard to protect us and continues to do so.  \n\nI wanted to share this story to shed light on what we have been through and to ask for advice on how to navigate these endless legal delays. Has anyone else experienced something similar? How do you deal with family betrayal and legal battles that seem to drag on forever?  ",

        "text": "\n\nIs it only me, or is anyone else tired of being asked for their mobile number at every turn? Whether I’m buying a cup of tea or clothes at the mall, everyone seems to need my number.\n\nI’m already bombarded with spam calls and texts. How can we be sure that businesses are asking for our numbers for their promotions and not just to sell our data?\n\nHere are some scenarios I’ve faced:\n\n1. When I rejected giving my number, a staff argued that they couldn’t provide a bill without a valid number. When I suggested entering a random number, they said they couldn’t do that because they verify with an OTP. I had no choice but to cancel the purchase.\n2. In another shop, they needed to get the bill from a self-help kiosk instead billing from the counter. However, the while redirecting, the sales guy sarcastically asked, \"Won't you give your mobile number if it's a bank?\" Unfortunately, I wasn’t at a bank; I was buying clothes.\n3. The last time I was at a phone store, they opened the new phone box even before I made the purchase. When I got to the billing counter and refused to give my mobile number, they pressured me into providing it. In the end, they used their own alternate number. When they handed over the bill, they mentioned that the warranty couldn’t be claimed since I hadn’t provided my mobile number. I believe the warranty should be linked to the product and the bill, not my mobile number. As I was leaving, another guy who didn’t know what had happened asked me to fill out a form for their lucky draw, which again I politely refused. \n4. Most of the new age coffee/tea outlets ask for mobile number for billing. When asked is there any discounts.. they don't know. Then why?\n\nI mean, can’t we just pay and get the product without all this hassle?\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you also find this excessive. If so is there anything we can handle this in legal terms",

        "title": "For Those Battling False Accusations and Divorce: Trust in Karma and Stay Strong",
        "text": "I’ve seen a lot of posts lately about divorce, false accusations of dowry, domestic violence, and outrageous alimony demands. It’s heartbreaking, and it’s almost as if there’s a standard template for these situations now.\n\nTL;DR; in the end.\n\nThis post is for all the honest victims out there, enduring false accusations and battling in silence. Stay strong, be true to yourself, and trust in the laws of the universe and karma. \n\nI’m a 30-year-old man, and I got married at 27. It was a love marriage. We were the same age, and we belonged to the same caste. I ignored all the red flags during our relationship, because I was naive, in love, and, quite frankly, stupid. But she was also good at hiding behind a mask. \n\nAfter our marriage, we moved into a separate house(not with my parents). She would run to her mother’s place over the smallest quarrels with me. These fights were so minor, the kind every couple goes through. We’d had fights during our relationship phase as well—it was nothing new. But now, she’d run off to her mother’s and threaten me with divorce. If things didn’t go her way, she’d drop divorce threats and make unreasonable demands. I bought her a SUV, taken her on trips and budged to many demands due to these threats. This went on for about a year.\n\nI finally had enough. One year after our marriage, I told her to stop with the threats. This particular fight was about me paying for my parents’ medical insurance, which she didn’t want me to do. That was the last straw, and it turned out to be the last time we were a couple.\n\nA month later, she filed for divorce, accompanied by the usual criminal cases against me and my parents: domestic violence, dowry, and more. She demanded 50 lakhs in alimony and 75,000 rupees per month in maintenance. It’s almost like the lawyers have a standard template. \n\nI want to be clear—I have never raised my voice, let alone my hand, to my wife. I didn’t take a single penny as dowry. In fact, I paid for half the marriage expenses, let her freeload on my money, took her on trips, bought gifts for her family, and even pampered her with an SUV. Just for context, she earns as much as I do. And my parents were never involved, as we stayed separate. \n\nFor three years, I fought hard, running from family court to criminal court, defending myself against these baseless accusations. It was mentally, physically, and emotionally exhausting. But I’m a firm believer in karma, and I had a deep sense that “truth will triumph.” During those three years, they tried to negotiate the alimony, but I held my ground. I prayed, trusted karma, and believed that justice would prevail.\n\nAnd it did. When it came to presenting evidence, my wife and her family had nothing. They were desperate to end the cases and get a divorce, realizing that their false accusations were getting them nowhere. After three years of court battles and one year of a failed marriage, the nightmare finally ended. \n\nFour years of my life were wasted—lakhs of rupees spent on marriage expenses, pampering my freeloading ex-wife, paying lawyer fees, and enduring endless stress. But it’s over now, and I’ve come out stronger.\n\nDuring that time, I fell into depression but eventually found my way out. I focused on my mental and physical health. I began meditating, practicing yoga, embracing spirituality, and hitting the gym daily. \n\nNow, I’m happier than ever. Life is blissful. I still meditate, work out daily, and travel the world, seeking new experiences. I’m at the peak of my health—still single and happy.\n\nTo anyone going through something similar, stay strong. Be honest, trust the universe, and have faith in karma. You’ll get through this, and you’ll emerge stronger on the other side.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:** After enduring a love marriage that ended in false accusations and years of legal battles, I emerged stronger by trusting in the universe, karma, and prayer. Despite the mental, physical, and emotional toll, I now live a blissful, healthy life. Stay strong and trust that the truth will prevail.",

My mother on the other hand is extremely extroverted. And she always misconstrued my wife's introverted behavior as disrespect towards her. She misbehaved with her by bitching about my wife with me. Within 1 year of my marriage, situation evolved into a full blown altercation between the both of them. And of course since then, nothing has been the same. I never took sides and let the discontent amongst the both of them brew. For the past 5-6 months, I have told my mom in very very strict tone & harsh language that her behavior is not acceptable.\n\nI even got my mom to write an apology letter to her. In the recent months, I have been begging both my mom & my wife to give one another second chance, but nothing is moving.\n\nMy relationship has hit a rock bottom now. My mental energy is drained now. I have bad terms, with my wife as well as my mother. My wife is now taxing each and every mis-step by my family towards her.\n\nMy only recourse has been apologize to her repeatedly, but I can't take it anymore.\n\nI need to separate myself from her for my sanity. How do I go about it?\n\nupdate: I live in BLR. Mom is in Delhi NCR.\n\nUpdate: Thanks to the redditors, it has helped me re-affirm that my is completely in the wrong here. for the past few days, my mom had massively colored my thoughts about my wife & I let her do that as well. i am feeling better after engaging with all the discussions.",

Due to Covid we couldn't do a full body check up this year. \n\nOne day, in his clinic, he felt some chest pain. It was pretty intense ig. He was not sweating or had any other symptoms. He took a pantocid as he thought it was acidity. While coming home at 2:00pm he didn't want to risk it so he checked with an hospital. They did an ECG. It came out normal. The doctor told him it was just acidity. So he came home, walked the steps ( further straining his heart, mind you he thought it was acidity) and suddenly collapsed five minutes later. He died of heart attack.\n\nWe found his ecg report in his pocket and consulted a heart specialist. The ECG report showed changes which the doctor neglected. For some reason the report was normal. The heart specialist we asked said that doctors Don't usually check whether the report shows normal or not but check the frequency of heart beat printed. He also said that there is a possibility that the machine was broken. Further more we found that the doctor was not a heart specialist but a duty doctor. The hospital my dad went specialise in cardiac cases. \n\nThis is definitely a neglect on the doctors part. Even if the machine was not broken, he ignored the changes in the heart beat frequency printed.\n\nI want legal advice on how to proceed further. \n\nPlease help, thank you.

My Dad works at this MNC where he is a service engineer (He repairs TVs for the customers who buy the company’s products) he’s always been respectful to people elder and younger than him and does he is best at his job. \n\n\nThere was this incident that took place few weeks ago where a customer( who’s rich and is influential) had booked a service request to the company as the customer’s kids had hit the tv and damaged it. The tv is worth around 2 lakh so the company decided to send my dad to fix the problem as he is a well skilled engineer. Since the panel was broken it cost around 1lakh to fix it and the customer agreed for it and the panel was replaced thereby resolving the problem. Dad had done his job and carried on with his work that day. \n\nA week ago Dad got a call from the same person at 9 pm saying that the had some issues with the tv. It was election day in Karnataka and we were returning back from our hometown. The phone was connected to the Bluetooth and we all heard him speak. Dad guided him through few settings that might solve the problem but the customer said it didn’t and my dad told him that he would visit their house once he is back in Bangalore and when he comes to that area. This guy got mad for some reason and started swearing at my dad. Since it was connected to the hands free in the car we all heard it and dad immediately cut the call thinking this guy must have been drunk. He calls again after few seconds and starts swearing again and my dad lost his cool and sweared back at him as he was swearing on my mom and grandmother. Dad later cut the call. Soon after this dad started receiving calls from these unknown numbers and they were threatening dad telling that they would break his bones if he didn’t apologise. Dad cut those calls as well. But we still started receiving a few more calls and one of them told my dad that if he calls and apologises to his boss they will leave him alone or they will come to our house and deal with us ( meaning they would kill us) they asked where we lived and dad told a wrong address. Since Dad was not in the wrong he never apologised. The next day this guy came to the office and dad had already informed his manager about this. The guy accepted that he was the first to swear and that he started it they discussed it and closed it there. The company then sent the trainers to inspect the tv and there was no fault. Everything was working fine and they were satisfied. Today the manager of this guy calls and asks for my dad’s location and name (the people who created all these scene haven’t seen my dad yet in person) he told the they can come to the office tomorrow morning and that they can see the manager there but this guy says he wants to see my dad and talk to him personally. Dads manager is on leave and will be back only after 4 days. We are scared that these guys will do something to my dad. They can’t do anything to him in the office but when he is out we fear that they might do something. We have a phone recording of one of his goons threatening my dad telling that we will break my dads legs if dad doesn’t apologise to his boss. We are kind of scared and not really sure what to do. This guy is gonna come to my dads office at 10am and my dad is planning on not going fearing that something might happen. I told my dad that all of these shouldn’t scare him and that he should go to work as usual tomorrow and that everything will be fine. In case if something goes south is there anything that I can do legally? Dad asked his manager whether he should file a complaint for harassment but then his manager told not to cause this might blow out of proportion and make things worse. I am not really sure what I should do. It seems like the rich with ego can easily destroy a family. Please do let me if there is anything that I can do legally if something happens (I wish it doesn’t) 😞",

Initially i ignored but then took him to the grocery and purchased dal,rice,oil for him. But since i wanted to check the legitimacy of his story(he was saying his family lived nearby in a roadside tent and his mother cant move) i told him to sit in our car and take him to his parents. We went and there was actually his parents we talked to them and realised the kid was speaking the truth. Then again i asked him to sit in the car and we dropped him 15mins after at the exact point where we picked him in front of the road cameras. i gave him the grocery along with some money and he thanked me.\n\nAlthough my friend later said i did a mistake by letting that kid sit in the car as he can accuse us of kidnapping and other things. By mom also told to not indulge in such things again as it can backfire. I realised my mistake but am really anxious and overthinking about it. Just wanted to know from all of you what i did was really wrong? Please help me from not overthinking about it",

        "title": "Friend's wife eloped without divorce",
        "text": "\nMy friend entered into a marriage with a girl who was initially against the union but succumbed to societal and family pressure. Despite facing financial instability, my friend made efforts to keep his wife happy, even borrowing money and relocating to a big city to fulfill her wishes. They spent 1.5 years together until my friend fell seriously ill and was hospitalized with little hope for recovery.\n\nDuring this challenging period, his wife returned to her parental home, expressing her unwillingness to become a widow and requesting a divorce. However, my friend's mother did not give up hope and arranged for his admission to an expensive hospital. Miraculously, after a month, his health began to improve. Despite this, his wife refused to return and started accusing her in-laws of abuse and dowry demands, ultimately filing a case against my friend.\n\nAdding to the complexity of the situation, without obtaining a divorce, his wife eloped with another man whom she had maintained continuous contact with. It is evident that she had been involved with this individual while still being married to my friend.\n\nThis sequence of events showcases the challenges my friend has faced within his marriage, including the initial reluctance of his wife, his own financial struggles, and his subsequent health crisis. Furthermore, the false allegations made against him, followed by his wife's elopement, have further complicated matters.\n\nNow what legal action he should take in situation like this?\n\nEdit 1 : Thanks for all the responses. I got my answer. Elopement/cheating is not a crime and divorce is the only option \n\nEdit 2 : Let me clear few things because people are thinking my frnd is more on wrong side than girl. First thing the girl was initially asked before getting married. Her family was not in that position that they can marry her to richly Prince so they had to settle down on as per their status. And i think most of the marrieges in India happen like this only. U won't get a Prince charming coming on a horse and take u to his castle. \n\nSecondly i mentioned that my friend got seriously ill and people around are strongly doubting that she has done something(maybe mixed something in his food. That's why she was sure that she is going to be widow and came to her parental house ) but there is no proof so i do not want to drag it further. \n\nAnd lastly financially she has done more damage with her unreasonable demands. He is now debt ridden.\n\nEdit 3 : After her elopement, I received the latest update regarding the situation. The man she eloped with is described as a chapri guy, someone with a casual and carefree demeanor. Although he is currently jobless, he maintains a stylish image. It is worth noting that while this elopement is the first for the woman, the man has eloped with three other girls previously, making this his fourth elopement.",

        "text": "We are a Muslim family from Maharashtra, and I am sharing my sister’s painful story. She was married in 2020 through an arranged marriage. The groom’s family seemed educated but turned out to be extremely controlling and orthodox. From the very first day, my sister faced mental and physical abuse.\n\nHere’s what she went through:\n\n1. **No Freedom from Day One:** On the first day after her wedding, her in-laws took away her phone and sent it back to us. When she asked her husband, he told her that daughters-in-law in their house are not allowed to have phones and she should use his phone instead. To avoid arguments, my sister gave up her phone and her connection to the outside world.\n2. **Total Control Over Her Life:** Her in-laws controlled everything—what she wore, who she talked to, what she ate, even how and when she laughed.\n3. **No Respect in Her Marriage:** Her husband ignored her completely. He spent most of his time with a girl named \"Gudiya,\" who lived with the family but wasn’t related to them. Shockingly, they even shared my sister’s bed while she was forced to sleep on the floor. He avoided talking to her and came home late at night to avoid any confrontation.\n4. **Her Career Dreams Crushed:** My sister is highly qualified (MA in Geography and B.Ed) and wanted to become a professor. Her husband was also a teacher before their marriage, so we thought he would support her dreams. But after marriage, she found out he had quit his job because his mother told him to. When she tried to prepare for exams like NET/SET, her sister-in-law created drama and stopped her from studying.\n5. **No Healthcare or Basic Dignity:** If she fell sick, she was mocked for being weak. They refused to take her to the doctor unless her condition was serious.\n6. **Gold and Dowry Demands:** Her in-laws constantly praised their elder daughter-in-law for bringing dowry and gold every month. They took all the gold my sister brought with her and kept it in a bank without her consent.\n\nShe silently endured this abuse for two years before finally telling us everything. We immediately filed a domestic violence case against her in-laws and husband.\n\n**Legal Struggles**\n\nSince filing the case, her in-laws have avoided every court hearing by manipulating the police and the system. Over a year has passed, and they haven’t attended a single hearing. Meanwhile, my sister has to go to every hearing, reliving her trauma.\n\nEven when a non-bailable warrant was issued, they managed to escape. Their lawyer even got permission for them to skip court appearances. The judge handling the case seems hesitant to take any action, leaving my sister stuck.\n\nTo make things worse, during this time, her husband secretly married another woman without my sister’s consent. While he lives happily, my sister is left to deal with endless legal battles and mental pain.\n\nWe once thought of settling the matter out of court to get her a divorce, but her in-laws refused. They want to “set an example” for other daughters-in-law, showing what happens if they speak out.\n\n**We are desperate for help.** All we want is for my sister to get a divorce and move on with her life.\n\n**Questions We Need Help With:**\n\n1. How can we speed up the court process and make sure her in-laws and husband are held responsible?\n2. What legal steps can we take to secure a divorce and protect her future?\n3. How do we fight the manipulation of the police and courts by her in-laws?\n4. Can stricter action be taken against her husband for marrying another woman without her consent?\n\nPlease help us. My sister deserves a chance to live her life with dignity and hope.",

        "text": "Yesterday, between 2 and 3 AM, part of our house collapsed due to weakened wooden and iron support pillars. Thankfully, no one was harmed, but three bikes parked outside were damaged—one crushed, one dented, and one unharmed. A steel almirah was also destroyed.\n\nWe've owned this house for about 26–28 years after purchasing it from the previous owner. Over time, minor cracks appeared, but they worsened significantly in 2019 when we were away in Kolkata for my sister’s wedding. During that time, my father’s friends informed him that lights were on in a storage room (approx. 300 sq. ft.) with an entrance only from the outside. This was suspicious because we had cut off the power before leaving. A friend confirmed there was activity inside, and we later discovered that the adjacent mosque/dargah had illegally broken into the room, installed an iron door, and started using it as their own.\n\n[The Door](https://imgur.com/gallery/1kpkve0)\nOur lawyers advised us to take pictures and videos of everything happening around the house.\n\n\nThis wasn’t their first attempt at illegal possession. In the 2010s, they forged my father’s signature (in Gujarati instead of English) to claim ownership, which failed. This time, they bribed the previous owner's son and created fake documents, mainly focusing on the storage room. When we returned, we filed an FIR immediately, but the case has been dragging for nearly six years due to COVID delays and legal postponements. My father has all the proper documentation, but the mosque authorities have strong local influence. Unfortunately, friends who could testify in our favor are too afraid to get involved.\n\nThe unauthorized drilling of an entrance weakened the structure, ultimately leading to the collapse. We informed our lawyers, who advised us to file a panchnama, which we did on Saturday. Officials are expected to inspect the site on Monday.\n\nAt this point, we’re exhausted and stuck, unable to sell or move due to the ongoing illegal possession. How can we fast-track the legal process? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n[before the house fell down](https://imgur.com/gallery/uwncpWA)\n\n[After the collapse ](https://imgur.com/gallery/IpcNbIW)",

He then brought some other guy on call who started weeping and saying ki much boot mar the pain gala phasa diya hai and what not. He then proceeded to forbid her from calling me and said that he is speaking from CBI and that my phone is with \"bade sahab\" and if she calls he will put me in jail.\n\nShe immediately called dad and made him transfer 50k on the number the guy gave. But at the end the amount deducted was 1.25 lakh rupees and not 50k, I do not have the exact details how this can happen. The number he called is from Pakistan and the number he asked to transfer is a virtual network number from Denmark.\n\nI know it is very difficult to trace such people, but is there any hope of getting the money back?\n\nThanks in advance.",

It was a petty amount - something that I lose almost everyday in Options trading <insert crying gif>. \nBut everytime I saw his updates about buying a car, buying a new Husqvarna, going on trips, etc I was reminded of the small amount of money he couldn't return. \n\nThe money was not the issue. Me feeling cheated and made a fool out of was. \n\nSo the other day I randomly came across a reel where I learnt I can sue him under IPC 406. I didn't want to because it was such a low amount that the paperwork and legal fees itself would end up costing me multiple times that amount. \nNevertheless, I texted him one line \"I am suing you under IPC 406\" and radio silence in the chat from his side was finally breached. Within 15 minutes I had a barrage of texts saying \"have you lost your mind\" \"nice try\" \"who would sue someone for 3k rupees\" \"my family eats law for breakfast I'll see what you can do\" - I mean how can one eat law for breakfast but okay. \n\nI just replied him - \"I am suing everyone who has defaulted even 10₹ and refusing to pay back. Our WhatsApp chats and UPI transaction history are enough evidence. I don't care how much it ends up costing me because I have 2 Lakh to recover so any amount I get back is okay. I am anyway paying the same amount in legal fees. I just thought of texting you myself because I never wanted our friendship to come to this. Everyone else has received a call from my lawyer directly as legal notice along with a hardcopy reaching their residence. So could you please confirm your address for me as I don't want to involve police just for finding your address in order for the legal notice to reach you\"\n\nHe pleaded to give him more time but I knew he is doing the same thing again so I straightway refused to do so. I just left him on read didn't even say no. He tried calling but I didn't answer his calls. \n\nLo and behold my money was credited back to me. \n\nSo everyone, just make your lawyer friend talk to your defaulter in legal terms without threatening language, just pretending that you're trying to make sure the legal process doesn't stop.",

It all started when my mother passed away 9 years ago and she was a government servant and I was working at a top IT company at that time, my sister was doing her BTech, my father however was not so good in his business, so after my mom was passed, I was the sole earner and my mom had pending dues from her service which we supposed to get and we had a house and empty land. I work in a different city as my eductions were don there but my sister in home town. \nSo, my sister and dad were ok when I was giving them money and suddenly when my moms settlement started coming in their activities changed, they stopped telling me everything. Here are the things how it was divided:\n\n1. X cash settlement - 70% my sister took 30% for me\n2. My moms gold - Everything my sister took (it’s a lot, I don’t know how much). Except my childhood dollar which had my name shaped.\n3. I signed for my sister to take moms govt job which was coming for me, since she died during service (Still my sister didn’t get that job because she got married and all).\n4. Moms pension - when they started getting moms pension they didn’t even tell me about it and I was also giving them money, after I got to know I stopped. \n5. My dad took loan for my sisters marriage, for just giving more gold and I did my marriage with mine and my wife’s own money.\n5. My dad transferred the remaining property ownership to my name in a settlement papers, of which the land was sold for just 10 lacs (less than the direct cash what my sister got) because of an another dispute the land was half encroached. My sister created a scene when my father died how I can sell the land without telling her.\n6. So finally we have our house, no one is staying in it since my dad passed away in Covid. My sister wants share in this too, since my sisters husband is a loser staying at his parents house, I thought I will give this house to my sister if she gives 70% of the property value, as I am all already staying in my own house near my office.\n\nMy wife is fine with this plan, in fact she suggested this, but we are not ready to give any share if my sister is not ok with this plan.\nCan my sister go for legal and ask for share after I sell it, if she does I am ready to do a share of whatever we got, which will give me more. Please advice.\n\n(I want to keep the relation with my sister, but she is not a adjusting person from childhood, she wants share in everything. If the situation was other way around I wouldn’t have made such a scene, since I got enough, she eve took the property settlement papers after dad died, I thought fuck it she can’t do anything with just papers)",

He used to say things like “I’ll keep you like a queen.” “No one in the family will have the courage to point fingers at you.” \nRight from the first day of marriage, abuse started. He called my sister names(R-word, ma behen ki gali). He used to gaslight her. Within a month, my sister became a typical scared girl from bubbly girl. His parents did the same thing. \n\nI’ll give one example: \nGuy’s parents also lived with them and once my sister was ironing the clothes and by mistake one cloth got burned. My Sister’s mother-in-law made a scene out of it, started crying and her father-in-law started abusing her and her(my) parents as well. Guy on the other told to apologise to them, not just apologise, his exact words were “pairon mein gir jao mere mummy papa ke aur maafi mango” and forced her head to do the same. \n\nThis is just one instance, I could go on and write hundreds of them. There have been moments when my sister’s father-in-law has tried to hit my sister but her husband stopped him but later that night, he would say to her that she deserves it. \n\n3 months into marriage, my parents went to my sister’s place to receive her for the first time visit to maika after Marriage. They confronted the guy and his parents for the behaviour and for every allegation they had an excuse and they justified it. My mama also went with them and got the recording of the guy saying “gaaliyaan toh mujhse flow flow mein nikal jati hain” and many other things they confessed but justified somehow. \n\nNow the point is, next month there’s going to be a meeting between my family and Their family for separation/divorce and my father is adamant on getting the money that he spent on the wedding (he literally spent all his life savings). Be it mutual divorce or a court case. \n\nGiven all the facts, should we go for court case? There has been a dilemma on whether or not we should go for it. Is the struggle really worth it? Given that the marriage failed in 3 months, we have the intention of marrying my sister again as well.",

It was an arranged marriage. \nAfter 3 months of marriage, his wife was not feeling well, so his mom and his wife went for medical checkup.\nNow the doctor after examining her, told his mother that the girl's age is 36 not 30. And she won't get pregnant. This comes as a shock to each and everyone in the family. \nAfter this also my friend's family took her to multiple doctors to get a second opinion. After testing every doctor said the same thing.\nNow his wife's family is suggesting to get IVF or adopt someone. But my friend or his family is not interested in doing this. He is thinking about divorce but his brother-in-law threatening him as he is a police officer. \nNow he also lost his job because he couldn't make enough sales. He is going through a lot right now, any suggestions, legal opinions will help alot.\nThanks. ",

My phone has automatic call recording on for unknown numbers so I listened to the call( I still have it) and I found out she was talking to her boyfriend and they were talking something on the lines of (He: Tum ghar jaao or change krke aao bahar hum aa rhe hain. She: ok hum jaa rhe hai par tum kuch glt mat krna mere sath. Then he said abb kiss do) or phir wahi nibba nibbi. \nBut what I fear is if they go absconding or something happens to the girl( maybe sexually if you can understand).

        "text": "I’ve seen this being discussed over and over in different forms here. I wanted to bring forth some points which most men tend to forget about marriage, and yes, this is more important than money/properties ever will be. \n\n\nIndia's law still allows men to rape their wives.\n(https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2023/01/09/marital-rape-law-india-supreme-court.html)\n\nNearly one in three women aged between 18 and 49 have suffered some form of spousal abuse, and around six percent have suffered sexual violence.\n\n\nAt the same time, we saw 35.5k dowry cases between 2017-2021; or about 7k a year. Maybe a minority of these are ‘fake’ cases but the total % is minuscule. \n\n\nHonestly, a woman should question why she is marrying someone in India, not the other way around. She is opening herself up to a 33% chance of DV and legalising possibly daily rapes from her husband. \n\nNo normal person wants to get into a live-in/marriage with someone, spending years of their lives, bringing parents etc into it and pouring their time, emotions and effort into it while plotting and scheming in the background. This works both ways of course, for men and women. \n\n\nTwo years is ample time for adults to judge compatibility. If you are with someone that long, marriage is just a tag, you are together. If you don’t feel that after two years, you are simply using the other person.\n\n\nFor all those asking why the laws are so skewed towards women, have you ever protested the exception to the law that allows a rapist to come home to his wife and assault her as he pleases everyday with no legal recourse? Given the 1/3 number for DV, you probably know someone, maybe within the extended family even, that have been DV victims at some point. Do you not see how helpful the laws are for them? \n\n\nWhen two people choose to live together, over time they get accustomed to a certain lifestyle. Typically in India, a woman, working or not, is seen as someone who has to handle a majority of domestic chores, especially if they are living with their in-laws. Please get this into your heads, marriage is not equal to free domestic help. It’s even worse in some backward homes where a woman is forced to leave their job and hence become financially reliant on their partner.\n\n\n In both these cases, and hence I’m addressing a vast majority of marriages/live-ins in India, a woman is sacrificing her time and effort for the household, same as the man when he goes to work. If a woman is working, typically the equation is even more lopsided. \n\n\nConsidering this, the laws are fair and address a majority of the populace. There will be exceptions to every rule but we can all agree that no law can ever be perfect. So please, get into a relationship for the right reasons and treat each other with respect and love (and make sure the extended family does too). 99% of you will then never need to care about such laws.",

        "text": "I was terminated from my job yesterday under the POSH act for reported incidents including inappropriate comments(which I don't remember saying anything offensive) and unwelcomed physical touch (touching their hair) from two female colleagues. My marketing manager(MM) & Sales manager(SM) the day before yesterday called me and told me to accept whatever HR says in tomorrow's meet so I can get my salary and to save my career without any blackmark and told me they will terminate me on other reasons not under POSH. So I agreed to whatever allegations that were put upon me on zoom which they recorded and saved it btw. On the same day MM & SM got me into their cabin told me not to circulate or leak this information as it might damage the company's reputation and female colleagues respect (My respect doesn't matter?) I agreed and got kicked out of the office after submitting the company's assets in the afternoon. In the evening I got an email from HR Head without including my manager(MM) stating that I have been terminated under the POSH act. I didn't reply to the mail cause SM & MM told me they will terminate me for other reasons. So I called my manager today regarding the same and He said he doesn't know about the mail and will give an update after reaching the office. After some time my manager calls constantly and tells me to reply to that mail immediately stating that I did commit everything the female colleagues said and request for salary till my last working day of this month.  I didn't reply to that mail this morning but got constant calls and messages from my manager to reply to it by EOD. (All the calls from my SM & MM were made through WhatsApp so I couldn't record it and benefit from it)\n\nThe two female colleagues are M & R. R is a very close friend of SM and might have got this job on his recommendation which I'm not sure of. On the other hand M is super friendly among everyone It doesn't matter male or female on Aug 15th She herself came up to me and asked for my Instagram handle stating we will be sharing reels to each other. I thought it was cool and agreed, she asked for my number and I gave her my number as well. We chatted and sent reels apart from that nothing very interesting happened. We used to meet in the office and say hi bye. She used to kick me in a friendly way I just touched her hair twice or thrice & she was not fine with it so I stopped touching her hair for 45 to 60 days & she didn't report to her manager(SM) about me touching her hair at that time which she should be doing immediately when she was not feeling comfortable.\nR on the other hand works with me in the same cabin we work together. She constantly gives me attention without me asking for it and I have even told her several times not to stare at me I feel uncomfortable but she didn't listen there were instances where she herself came up to me for help and touch my hands, once she even rubbed her hand on my neck which made me super uncomfortable but I didn't report it to anyone. Just after I got my neck rubbed I just touched her hair I knew she was uncomfortable but she didn't report this to my manager(MM) as well and I never touched her hair again. This happened 45 to 50 days ago. And even R didn't report to her manager about this thing at that time.\nI was performing well in my job we could see a growth and my three month probation period was over. I asked for a salary hike and my manager approved that same on the 5th of this month. Only me in my team got a hike after probation. My team was not happy with it I could clearly see. Lost in touch with M & R completely used to ignore them most of the time as I was interested in other girls. During this time M & S got along so well they spent so much time together in the office. But R didn't stop frequently staring at me for no reason. Last Saturday R stared at me for a longer than normal period of time so I had to ask her what? What's wrong? Do your work. She responded to the same thing that got me pissed. We both were taken into the manager's cabin where we fought there in front of the managers as well she grabbed her laptop and said she will hit me with it. I couldn't control my anger,I said If you do, I will slap you right in front of both managers. We both came to a conclusion and apologized and agreed that we won't bother each other. \n\nI took the day off on this Monday. My both female colleagues M & R teamed up together with some other female colleagues and each one of them themselves went into SM cabin to explain to him about my behaviour and each one of the female colleague had problem with my behaviour and attitude. The only evidence to prove their statements are either other females colleagues saw or heard the conversation. Even though there are CCTV and voice recorders are installed both managers SM & MM are not willing to check and confirm. When R comes to explain about my behaviour or complains M is the only witness she has and when M comes to explain only witness she has is R. The complaints are that I have touched their hair, I have asked them weather they have watched porn or not. Me asking about their sex life are the allegations that are added on me and their evidences are their female colleagues itself. These allegations didn't happen recently it was happened way before maybe they should have said reported it to their managers right away but now they all teamed up all at once and each one of them all of a sudden had problem with my behaviour attitude and everything. \nPlease help in this regard and provide some insightful information if you faced the same. I will be open to respond all this night and day as im unable to sleep and I'm getting suicidal thoughts since the day I was terminated. ",

        "title": "rape on pretext on marriage",
        "text": "The concept of \"rape on false pretext of marriage\" raises several important questions and concerns. Why are women perceived as less capable of making their own choices? Some argue that women are manipulated, but are adult women not capable of making their own decisions? If a woman lies before being intimate, why can't men also file similar complaints?\n\nWomen should be held responsible for their actions. This outdated mentality that women are inherently less responsible stems from traditional beliefs. Historically, if a couple engaged in premarital sex, men were often pressured to marry the woman, as if she bore no responsibility for her own actions.\n\nIf the issue is lying and cheating, then why is it registered as rape? It could be classified as deception or fraud instead. Societal changes must be acknowledged; our society is increasingly adopting Western norms, including live-in relationships, premarital sex, and a rise in hookup culture. Laws should evolve to reflect present realities rather than past values.\n\nGenuine rape laws are crucial, but punishing consensual sex under false promises is problematic. An adult woman can choose to have sex and should also bear responsibility for that choice. Moreover, the burden of proof often lies on the man to show he did not promise marriage, which is difficult to prove.\n\nIf a woman values her virginity highly, she has the option to refuse and report harassment rather than engage in consensual sex. There are both \"gross\" and \"good\" men regarding views on virginity, and women should not seek validation from those who judge them based on such criteria.\n\nSociety's perspective on premarital sex is evolving, and if someone is bold enough to engage in it, they should also be able to ignore societal judgments. The stigma around virginity is less significant compared to the severe consequences men face due to false accusations.\n\nWestern societies, which we are increasingly emulating, do not have similar laws. These laws are not reflective of the current societal context. Women are fully capable of making informed decisions, and laws should not infantilize them.\n\nFalse accusations should not go unpunished as they can ruin lives. Although some feminists argue that punishing false accusers may deter genuine cases, it is essential to address the high rate of false accusations to maintain justice.\n\nPolicies should be based on current realities, not historical grievances. We need to move forward and ensure equality for all genders. Addressing discriminatory laws and practices is crucial for genuine progress towards gender equality.\n\nEven courts are concerned today seeing number of fake cases increasing day by day.The statistics are shocking.\n\nAND IF ITS 100 PERCENT PROVED THAT IT wAS FAKE CASE..I DONT SEE ANY REASON AS TO WHY THE FRAUDSTER SHOULD GO UNPUNISHED. \n\nyes there r still ppl making virginity of women a big deal.but it is being fought.several movies have come up and people are being vocal.so why not even go against such discriminatory laws too?\ni know this country is way behind gender equality..but that doesnt mean we start propagating something wrong.aim for equality from both sides.criticise anything that is discriminatory against any gender.\n\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/reel/C1tzkMwpoX6/?igsh=MWdrN3Q2cjd5YmQ2MQ==\n\n\n\nWomen are free to make bad choices, like men. \nAre they saying it’s illegal  to change your mind about marrying a particular person.\n\nWHY ARE WE LIVING IN THE PAST?",

        "text": "My girlfriend and I have been together since 2014 and we got married in early 2022. A few months before our marriage, I had some suspicious that she was cheating on me. Since it was a long relationship i didn't want to end it based on a suspection but everytime I had confronted her, she'd gaslight me into thinking that I'm some psycho and no one would love me because i have a suspicious and perverted mind. He was her friend and work colleague after all and I felt terrible considering that this guy was married and has a daughter too. This guy would come home from time to time to have a drink with us since his wife didn't know he drinks and our house was a place where he felt safe. I couldn't object to this at all. I confided in a few friends who know her as well and they all told me that I'm over thinking things because there's nothing that proves that she's cheating. With all this I felt guilty and proceeded with the wedding as there was absolutely no support from anywhere and I had nothing apart from a hunch that she was cheating. After marriage there were still behaviours that were very off and everytime I confronted her, she'd made me feel so terrible for asking her these things. I  had also been slapped multiple times for asking her such demeaning questions to a point where I started believing that I'm mad and began therapy to fix my fucked up head... Nothing was working, I was still plagued by suspection so i did something extremely unethical. I installed a spy camera in our home that would broadcast to my phone. My intention was that if theres nothing going on, I'll know for sure that I'm an obsessive over thinker and can actually start more intense therapy, this time believing that i actually have a problem, but I wanted proof that I'm wrong...\n\nA month had passed. There was an evening where we were both invited to a friends house for dinner. She had a webinar to present along with her boss and was assisted by the guy I was suspecing her with. She asked him to come home that afternoon for lunch so that they could both prepare for the evenings presentation. I had to be ok with this because it was work. In the evening she suggested that I'd go and spend time with our friends while she's giving the webinar as I'd have nothing to do at home until shes done, and I could come pick her up once she's done... The venue was only 4kms away from our house so it all made sense for me to go and come back later to get her.\n\nWhile i was at my friend's house we were ordering food and they had asked me what to get for my wife. I thought I'd call her but it had been 10min since the webinar had started so i thought I'd call up the guy instead to ask and get back to me. \n\nMy phone was in the room charging. I went to get it to make the call. By accident, my finger slipped and I opened the spy cam app instead of the phone app and I was just about to close it when I notice them fucking, WHILE THE WEBINAR IS TAKING PLACE... The both of them were in front of their laptops, answering QNA's in the chat while switching sex positions. She didn't lie, there was an actual webinar and she was actually typing out responses... I felt an immse sense of relief right there. For the first time in 2 years, I felt sane. I was right all this time. I quickly screen recorded the entire thing and then proceeded to call him pretending not to know anything... I called, she picked up and told me what she wanted while stroking his dick. She also told me that the webinar is almost done and shes only answering QNA's and that I can leave in 5min to come and pick her up. She hung up after saying \"I love you\" and continued blowing him till he came in her mouth... I was so shocked at how well she was able to lie so effortlessly... \n\nI left to my house, reached and pretended to be completely clueless about what I just saw on my phone. She greeted me and said that the session went well, grabbed her purse and we both made our way to the car. I had to maintain my cluess and calm facade so while we were walking downstairs, I leaned in an kissed her (something that we do everytime we going down the stairs). After kissing her, I said \"eww, why does your mouth taste like dick?\" ... She got furious and started the same guilt trip and said that I'm driving her insane and I need some serious psychological help and that she's fed up with me and my suspicions... I apologised and said I didn't mean anything Ill, I just made a genral obversation. She understood, apologised for snapping and we went to our friends for dinner...\n\nThat's when I realised that i married a master manipulator who's a freakn psycho...\n\nHere's where I feel stuck! I haven't confronted her yet. It's been about 2 weeks since this happened. I made up some story that I'm needed at my dad's house in Hyderabad for some family property matters and I've been stayin here ever since. The only proof that I have about her infertility is the video, which i obtained from a spy cam that I placed in our hall without her consent and this could easily back fire on me as a pornography case or anything else since I'm a man and she's a woman... \n\nI don't know what to do.",

        "text": "My friend applied for his passport renewal over nine months ago through BLS International, as required by Indian embassies abroad. Despite numerous follow-ups, he has only been told that his application is “with the embassy,” with no updates or resolution. Attempts to contact the embassy have gone unanswered, leaving him stuck in limbo.\n\nThis isn’t an isolated case—passport delays disproportionately affect Kashmiri applicants, who often face processing times of 7 months to over a year, compared to the typical 1-2 months for others. Even his initial passport application in Srinagar faced similar delays, pointing to a concerning pattern of systemic discrimination.\n\nThese delays go beyond inconvenience—they’re dangerous. Applicants abroad are required to submit their existing passports, leaving them vulnerable in emergencies, while those applying from within India often miss valuable opportunities due to prolonged delays. This lack of transparency, accountability, and fairness raises serious concerns and may violate fundamental rights under Articles 14 and 15 of the Indian Constitution, which guarantee equality and non-discrimination.\n\nHe is seeking legal advice to address this systemic issue, not just for himself but for the many Kashmiris who endure these delays in silence, often out of fear of retaliation. He asked me to post on his behalf as he is apprehensive about drawing attention to himself or his family.\n\nAny advice on legal recourse, relevant laws, or organizations that could assist would be immensely helpful. \n\nThank you for your time and support!\n\n",

This union was doomed from the beginning\nIn the duration I have known him , not a single day has passed when he hasnt abused substance ( cannabis)\nI am against any form of addiction. We had discussed his options for leaving substance many times. most of the time it led to fights. which later got sorted with a promise of chnaging his ways. \nthere was no change on his part neither prior to marriage nor after. \n Soon he proposed to me. Because of what was happening  I was very unsure about this alliance. \nHe introduced me to his family and they were very eager for this marriage.  He insisted that we lived with his parents after marriage.\n\nMy parents were against this marriage. But he was able to somehow convince me against my better judgement. \nI had bad feeling about this marriage since the day it was being discussed. I was extreamly stressed and anxious before and during this marriage.\nI  did not want to go through this marriage, i even said so several times but he and his family were able to convince me everything will be ok after marriage.\nI have been feeling sick since the marriage. All hopes I had all those promises of changing have been  brutally murdered. \nHe has slapped me on several occasions before as well as after marriage.even when he is not under the influence.\nHe berates me in front of his family, and his family doesnt stop this. They accepted that I can work after marriage. But now they make an issue if have to step out of the house. I had to leave my job. \nI have tried everything i can to make this relationship work. \nIt has started to effect me emotionally, mentally and physically this has affected my confidence. \n\nI cannot stay in this marriage any longer. I need urgent solution to this situation ( legally if possible ). Please help.\n \n\nOkay i heard you guys so i am doing some edits \n\nEdit 1 - I still agreed to this marriage because there was a lot of gaslighting involved from his side , how did i get gaslighted because i have low self esteem coming from neglected childhood \nMy mother was abusive towards me as she wanted a boy she was against this marriage because she wanted me to marry someone of her choice to control my life \nAll my childhood i struggled to get a job and move out of my parents house\n\nEdit 2 - Can i get this marriage annuled on grounds of domestic violence and drug  abuse \nI dont have direct proofs but i have voice notes and pictures \n\nEdit 3 - I also need a plan on how to get out of here the moment i get a job what hurts most is the betrayal and deception of trusting the wrong guy giving him chances  all those shubhchintak people kept on saying to me he will change give him some time \nIts been 13 months in total i had a sinking realisation in my stomach he will never change and it keeps on getting worse so ive decided to not stay \n\nhe knew about my parents my childhood  and thought no one would come to my aid he is right \nFirstly bad childhood now bad marriage feels like it never gets better \n \n",

        "text": "\nIt all started a month ago when I received a gas cylinder bill of ₹940.50. So, I brought ₹940 to the person (I didn't had change), and he started arguing with me, saying, \"mere sahab aise nahi lete hai, sirf 1 rupaye hi padta hai.\" I didn't have any idea how INR rounding off works back then (FYI: 50 Paisa rounds to the nearest bigger amount if this arises), but what we study in our maths is (6.5 ---> 6 and 5.5 ---> 6; odd goes up by +1). Yesterday, I received it for this month, and the guy was trying to flee away with my ₹2 loss. When asked, he started saying, \"agli baar lelena, bhaag thodi jayenge, kaisi baat kar rahe hai.\" (This plug-in was to show how they make you feel guilty if you ask for your 1 or 2 rupees back, and when the situation reverses, they make you feel guilty again.) The main concern is if this amount is added for two months, it comes out to ₹1881. The gas cylinder is supplied in major amounts to almost every house in India, and if this high amount of ₹0.50 is multiplied, it will actually be a very big amount. Again, I am not sure how these things work; I was curious to know public opinions.",

        "text": "\nWe went to the Police Station yesterday to file a complaint against the guy.  After thorough investigation by the Police, a written statement was taken from me, and the guy was asked to come down to the station. When he was called for the first time, he said he would be there within 30mins so we waited. He was called again after 45mins, and this time he said his manager would be coming instead. We waited 45mins more for his manager to come and no sign of him either. By this time the delivery guy’s phone was switched off. After waiting for 30mins more, his manager was phoned and asked to come down to which he agreed. 1more hour passed, the cops started getting pissed as both were fooling the police now by saying one of us will come in next 10-15mins and still no sign of either of them. The manager was called again as to know why he is not bringing the delivery person, his answer was that – ‘sir, he is scared’. This was the same delivery person who was confidently smiling and saying I could complain wherever I want, to whomever I want to, and nothing would happen. Where was his showy bravery now? Anyways, after making the Police unit wait for 3.5hrs they both finally arrive at the station. The delivery guy’s statement was taken. As he was giving the statement, he started addressing me as Madam. His whole demeanor had changed,from being pompous to suddenly a respectful man. The same man that disgustingly remarked on me being alone at home and wanting to know what I was doing, the same guy laughing and smiling while denying the order and enjoying the part where I still wanted the order and was asking him to stop. No right-minded delivery agent asks what you are doing inside alone just because you are late to open the door and especially after noticing that you in fact are alone. At most they will ask what took you so long, show some frustration on their face. So, it was none of this freak’s business to comment on whether I was alone or not which was just blind sided by some people here because they wanted to shift the entire blame to me and sympathize with the delivery guy. Well, guess who had the last laugh now (referring to someone saying that I harassed the guy and if he had complained against me, what would happen and who would have the last laugh) after the Police detained him and now a petty case is on his way, unless I request them not to file one. His arrogance that his misbehavior, teasing won’t be taken seriously and that too by the Police? A lesson was taught. I have also posted on twitter, emailed Amazon’s grievance officer, nodal officers, customer executive regarding the incident as told by some people. Thanks to all you people who thought that this was a genuine concern and provided your inputs on what I should do next.\n\nTo the other set of people here who said that I felt entitled cause I have money, It was not harassment, I am the one who harassed the guy, I am overreacting, ‘YTA’, I am looking for validation, I am whining, I am taking it to the next level by making it about women’s safety, I need to do this on twitter instead of reddit, I was desperate for the order, labelling as borderline classism and what not. I am just glad that I didn’t listen to your comments. And what had to be done is done by the Police. I pray for the women in all your lives and I hope a day doesn’t come in your life where some stranger that just needs to do his assigned job comes to your door and says to your sister/mom/any woman in your life- ‘pata nahi akheli kya kyakarri hai andhar’ cause they were late and also starts mocking, teasing around with the order and has no fear of consequences. I say this cause these women disappointed in you all. This man made the Police wait for 3.5hrs. Guess who is the entitled one now? And yes, like someone commented Respect goes both ways, thali dono hath se bajti hai, I agree with you. In no way he was respectful to me in the entire incident, so I gave back what I got from him.",

Then, I fawned (which is trauma response)—hugging and kissing him, trying to find comfort, safety, and trust in an unsafe situation. And again I froze when he kept his mouth on my breasts. I questioned him the next day that why he forced me, and he admitted that he forced me knowingly ( but he said it wasn’t preplanned and he did it on the moment, Anga yaara eruinthalum apditha agi erukum, his words were, any man would have done the same in that place, such a disgust comment ( what was I an Object ?, that’s how it felt ), He excused himself with his words “I did you wrong but I’m not a wrong man” “why did you allow me to your home”.\n\nEven If it wasn’t my home, it would’ve still happened to me in any other day, at any other place, at any other time. It doesn’t have to be my home at night. The least respectful thing, he could’ve done is value my NO, but to him, “his desire” felt more important than my consent and comfort. \n\nEven though he admitted to forcing me but then he shifted blame and avoided accountability and said, \"At least you should have stayed in control.\" ( I told him I feel unsafe and I wanted to be alone, rather than addressing my feelings of unsafety, this was his opportunity to say “Ennakum thaniya tha erukanum nu thonuthu”, He betrayed me in days shortly afterwards, like use and discard ). Days before this incident, at his home during day time, he tried to remove my top by force, I said NO, he tried to remove it again, I held it tight so he stopped, he said to me, It must’ve triggered ur past trauma, I won’t ever do like that again. I thought what a good man, I trusted him and respected him enough to allow him to my home, when he asked me if he can visit mine, but now as he got awareness that removing it on his own despite NO, is clear violation, he coerced me by consistently pressuring me into it….\n\nHis Friends made excuses for his actions and invalidated me saying, “Forcing is wrong but it’s not preplanned, it’s situational and another one said, he must’ve had different intentions.” \n\nHe admitted that he did not Love me and he made false promises of marriage recklessly. The fawning and freezing was trauma response. Fawning was my brain, trying its best to find comfort and safety in him, after freezing where I went absolutely Frozen, unable to move. ( Him repeatedly ignoring my NO caused me to relive flashbacks of my past SA from Childhood, I had Flashbacks of it, when he repeatedly ignored my NO that is how much he forced me). It hurts a lot the trauma, Couldn’t express in words, it’s been months, He is Ex Boyfriend.\n\nIs this legally considered as a crime, in India \nBut I feel like I’d probably be victim blamed. \nJust cause I trusted him to Allow him to my home, doesn’t mean I owed him Sex / Sexual Activity.\nwe both mutually agreed on our Limits, from the beginning of relationship. \n",

(Both my parents working so only us in the home).\nSince some months seeing her outing a lot. She says its with her friends. AFAIK, almost all of them have even left the city itself and some live out of city for work. \n\nOk, now main problem. My parents went to the relatives due to relative marriage and leaving us alone. \nA week ago, saw at night heard weird noices from my parents bedroom, went to hall saw fluid and tried peeking in the room, saw my sister DOING IT with some guy, was shocked and angry as she was more excited behaving like slut. The guy was ugly looking like begger\nI was so angry that i wanted to slap and beat her . \nI controlled, we weren't talking as till afternoon i was in school (curricular project) and till evening when she was in home i to not see her face was in my room doing dinner. \nI was thinking what to do, so I don't regret later, but now after the incident happened  yesterday i am not able to even process my mind. \n\nYesterday, the guy came again in late night, after some time i went again to peek in the room, i cried , i saw her with two men. Raw doing her, and one was literal uncle. She was being did by both and she was enjoying it. I am not fully sure but i\n Think they did cum in her. My mind was just stuck, i was not able to comprehend anything. I was just seeing her and crying and not knowing what i can do. \n\nI tried talking her , she denied saying she don't have time and went outside to meet her 'FRIENDS ',  as she said. \n\n\nShe is cheating with her husband as one day her husband called me asking if everything is fine as she isn't picking his call. \n\nMy jija(brother husband) ,  is literally very sweet ,innocent and kindest person i ever meet. \n\nAfter getting married to my sister, he even got seperated from parent home and bought new home. And he do treat her like princess. \n\nI have lost all respect for my sister after yesterday. (I had some before yesterday) . \nShe is not my sister, 😭 , whom do i tell. \n\nWhom do i tell it to. And will they believe me. Also what if she denies afterwards . I dont even know i am too scared. \nIts not even 5 years in their marriage. \nAnd let me say i will do anything to protect my brother in law from my sister. She isn't my sister anymore. \n\nYou don't know how bad and uncomfortable i am feeling seeing her yesterday. \n\nMy hands are shaking typing. \n Please dont delete this mod. I have no where to find solution. \nI posted here because i have no mature people to talk to. \nShe was just now, fighting with me telling me to go out tomorrow afternoon as her  friends will come to party. I know what party and what friends. I am dying from the trauma inside and on top of that her lying, .\n\nShe is a slut, whore,  you just peek in her room you will now find her masterbating.\n\nIt was  worse than any breakup. I feel like God would have just killed me instead of showing the real face of my sister. Or killed her. It would have been so less disturbing , .\n\nI can't live with this trauma,",

        "text": "Few months back my nephew who is about 13 yr old showed a youtube channel to my daughters and tried to force them to also create youtube channel. I found that my nephew had accounts on many different websites and social media platforms like facebook, instagram, twitter, youtube, dicord and many gaming sites. I also found that he had several friends on internet some of which were adults and he was watching adult and sexual content on internet.\n\nI was very worried and complained to his parents who are my close relatives. The parents did not do anything. They were feeling proud that their son was an expert in internet, computer and smartphone.\n\nI have been a school teacher and was really worried about my nephew and my daughters. I wrote a letter to principal of Springdales School Pusa Road where my nephew studies and asked her to protect the students of her school from this type of dangerous activities. I also sent links to the accounts of my nephew and his risky behaviour on internet with my letter. At first the principal ignored my letter. My nephew again tried to force my daughters to use youtube channel. So I sent a reminder to the principal of his school.\n\nThe principal replied saying that this was my family dispute and the school will not interfere. I was very shocked and wrote back to her asking why she was calling this a family dispute and was it not the duty of the school to protect its students from all bad influences. The school principal got very angry and sent me a threatening letter accusing me of harrassing the school and its students and that she has complained against me to the police. Here is her letter:\n\n>I am sending your mail to the cyber safety cell.  \n>  \n>As you are not a part of springdalian family you have no buisness to harass my students aren't or staff.  \n>  \n>We have found out in details and there is no aorta of truth in your allegations.  \n>  \n>If I recieve any such mail further it will be a matter of police and cyber enquiry.  \n>  \n>Stop this harassment.\n\nHer earlier reply had her signature but not this reply. This is also poor english and it not a proper format of a letter. I am very disturbed at the attitude of the school principal.\n\nHow can she say that I am harassing? Can she complaint against me for informing the dangerous activities of the student. What should I do?\n\nI want to also ask if there is some authority to which I can send complaint about this risk use of internet by underage children specially because the school principal and parents are not doing their duty?",

At the same time he informed CEO and instead of any repurcussion for him, the CEO actually promoted him. Also, the management got to know that I use tinder, and they established a connect with girl, and her bosses. They started rumors in the office about my character.\nAt the same time I started recieving demand for 2 cr rupees from the girl citing some important problems at home. I figured I have been setup in a trap and decided to quit the company. When I told I'll put papers, the management said \"you will anyways work for us wherever you go\".\nI am fearful, that they will use this information against me in future saying I had wrong intentions of joining the company and I was not a person of character. They've also sent extra money in FnF, which they may plan to use saying I threatened them of their reputation in market or something. Also instead of voluntary resignation, they are making their story as if they asked me to resign knowing things about me.\n\nShould I be worried for this? What should my plan of action be?

What I want to say is, if you are already taking those two additional fees, isn't it wrong to charge more on the base price of the food? Isn't there a way where this can be challenged? Either put base price high and remove your handling+delivery fees Or just take those charges but only on the base price of the food which is same as the one for dine-in.\n\nEdit: some are misunderstanding a little. If these are providing a platform, then that's what this handling fee is for. That I'm totally fine with. But raise the base price of the dish, that's the main issue here. If you want to charge for the service, mark them as separate charges. Charging the food at a higher rate is just a way to mislead the consumer, instead charge that amount as your separate fee.",

I'm genuinely sorry for this ....i just wish i don't want to go through what my cousin has gone though from all these 2 years\n\n",

I need it only for self protection. They suggest for pepper spray which I have no interest of. \nHave seen Gujarat High court ruling that police cannot stop citizens from owning guns as right to self protection is guaranteed in our constitution. What is the supreme court's view on self protection? I stay in Bangalore(if relevant). What is the right way for me to approach the police to get their approval?\n\nEdit: To add more context. The police response time in my city is 30 min on average. If I take smaller towns or villages it's much worse. I have heard stories of tech guys getting robbed at knifepoint on \"outer ring roads\" during night(not even isolated cross roads). When I come home on bike after my second shift I need much more than pepper spray. Running away is not my strong point with having asthma. Seeing most of the comments I feel that the guarantee of life of aggressor is more important than the victim. I believe when my life is threatened with a weapon(knife, machete or gun) I have all the rights to counter it with  deadly force through a gun. Additionally, mob justice is a thing in India. 10 hits with a stick or stone then I am close to dead. Doesn't have to be that mob comes to me with a gun. Sticks are enough to kill a man by 10 idiots. A gun will atleast guarantee me a fighting chance. \n\nPlease answer legally. Most are answering emotionally as to what they feel about gun laws. ",

        "text": "I (36 f) have been separated from my husband (40) for over a year now. He is an alcoholic who was physically, verbally and sexually abusive. I told my parents about his abuse about 6 months before I was able to leave him. My parents and I talked about me leaving him, but i was also afraid to take a big step. We have 2 kids also 6 y o and 2 y o. My parents live abroad while I lived with husband and his family in india. My parents told my maternal uncle about this and he had told me to let him know if i needed help. \n\nIn Nov 2023, my husband and I and kids went to a family wedding and my uncle was there. He took my husband aside and scolded him and told him he should be good and stop drinking or else my uncle will help me get away from him. My husband was deeply offended that my uncle scolded him and when we came back from the wedding, his abuse and torture escalated. I immediately called my parents and they flew down to india, and along with my uncle and another uncle who is a lawyer, they brought the police. I wrote a police complaint (not FIR, only written complaint as a letter) and left with my parents, along with my kids in early December 2023.\n\nI went with my parents to the country where they live, and i was fully transparent to my husband and his family about where we are. They do video calls with children at least 5 days in a week. Husband knows our address and has ordered cake and toys for the children a few times in the last year. Just to add, he has not sent any money or anything like that since we left and i have not asked either. I started working again (i had stopped before marriage) and i am sending my kid to school and managing other expenses with my parents help. My parents don't live in a western country where it is difficult to get visa or where flights are expensive. Visa is on-arrival for $50 and there is a direct flight from mumbai. My husband and inlaws are upper middle class and well able to afford it. I have invited them all to come and visit the children whenever they want. I don't want anything to do with them but I have no intention of keeping the kids from them.\n\nEvery other week, my husband sends random ranting messages to me insulting me and my family members and friends. Recently he started messaging disgusting things directly to my family and friends too. They all sent me screenshots and i told them to ignore and block him. Only i have not blocked his number for the sake of the kids. Last night he sent a message to me that my uncle tried to r*pe his sister two years ago when we had gone to my parents' hometown (in india) for my 2nd delivery. He has been angry at my uncle because of his scolding, and every now and then he calls him derogatory names, but this is going too far. His sister is a 42 years old and unmarried but in a good job and a smart woman. I sent her his message screenshots and she said 'so sorry, i will scold him'. He obviously sent this without her knowledge. It's bad enough he is defaming my uncle, but also his sister? \n\nAnyway, i guess her scolding also hasn't helped because he is continuing to say the same thing about my uncle, and also saying my uncle might have tried to do the same to his own daughters (he has 2 daughters). I have ignored all of his other disgusting rantings (he called my father a chakka, and my sister a prostitute for working night shift - she is an emergency doctor), but this is really unbearable for me. \n\nCan I file a defamation case just from his text messages?

(before marriage, if you do it after marriage the judge will make you pay).\n* Avoid joint accounts until trust is established.\n\n**Legal Safeguards Against False Allegations**\n\n* **Section 498A:**\n   * Protects against false dowry claims.\n   * Record all interactions to provide evidence if allegations arise.\n* **False Rape and Domestic Violence (DV) Allegations:**\n   * Ego clashes can lead to severe legal actions like a Rape case on your father and DV case on your mother and sister.\n   * Ensure all interactions are respectful and well-documented.\n\n**Additional Precautions**\n\n* **Document Consent:**\n   * Record verbal and written consent during all significant interactions.\n* **Protect Your Family:**\n   * Ensure your family is aware of these precautions and involved in the documentation process.\n* **Stay Informed:**\n   * Continuously educate yourself on your legal rights and obligations.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTaking these precautions does not mean you should avoid marriage take pre-cautionary steps because I don't want you to God-forbid suffer after marriage like the Gentleman and other men.\n\nI always say this \"You need to become someone, someone might want to be with.\"\n\n**Marriages are never 50-50, which is why I won't suggest you to marry a feminist unless there are very depending circumstances.**\n\nP.S. - If Lawyers can add more points in the comments would be appreciated.",

He's supporting them financially from last year. He went to his home few mnth ago nd overspent his credit card as well. He didn't have money to pay the bill of credit card so he took loan from office as well. Due to which 5000 gets deducted from his salary. So he receives 13000 out of which 4000 is his house rent. He has to send money to his family as well and he sends around 2000-3000. After everything he has around 7000 left with him. \nSo today his parents got notice from the bank tht they have to pay the loan amount in 4000 installment from next month, as hiw parents are broke its now completely on him. The thing is he would be left with 3000 rs to live in a month which is very less in a capital city and considering his corporate life it is more difficult. \nHis parents don't have any savings or asset. They only have their home and a plot, which they aren't looking for sale. They don't earn a single penny. I am a student right now and I can't help. \nPlease suggest me some practical solution to this problem. Please it's a request.\n\nEdit: He studied bpharm. He works in a nutraceutical company and is in the purchase dept. He's very confident and has excellent skills as well.\nHe's already been working the night shift for the past one and half years.

        "text": "My father has been renting a shop for past 40 years but now the landlord is asking him to vacate the shop as he wants to use it for his personal business. He's asking to vacate it in a month or two with a compensation of 1.5 lakhs. \n\nHow he came to this figure of 1.5 lakhs? When my father rented this shop in 1985, he paid a deposit of 20,000. The landlord says he had discussed (with my father's elder brother) that at the time of vacating, he'll pay the deposit + interest at the rate of bank. IMP: Neither he nor my father has any paperwork related to this.\n\nBut I think both the money and the time given is way too low for a shop rented for 40 years. Any advise please, what are our legal options? Please help.\n\nPS: Me and my brother are now employed with good salaries. The shop is not the primary source of income for my family. It's more like my father has been doing this for 40 years and can't just stop all of a sudden.\n\nEdit: Ok the comments here are not what I expected. I don't understand why people are so angry nowadays. Shameful, entitled? Jumping to conclusions straightaway. I was just asking for advice here. No I don't think I am the owner. No I don't think I should be paid some hefty amount of money. I just wanted inputs on what tenancy laws say in such cases.  But some comments are just non-helpful, jumping to conclusions. Thanks for the rest of you who gave honest advice.\n\nEdit 2: Am I wrong in assuming the landlord can't just ask someone to vacate their shop after renting for such a long period. There's got to be some time window given so that the tenant can have some backup source of income prepared?\n\nEdit 3: What makes me think I should get money as compensation? Because that's what the landlord and we had agreed on at the time of renting. ",

        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\n\n\nI need some advice on dealing with an issue I’ve had with Flipkart regarding a defective product and the company’s refusal to accept a return or refund, which they are justifying based on a closed return window that, in reality, lapsed due to their own delays.\n\n\n\n**Background**\n\nI ordered a pair of CMF by Nothing Buds Pro 2 from Flipkart, delivered on \\*\\*13th Oct 2024\\*\\*. The earbuds upon usage showed signs of overheating and honestly they just dont fit me comfortably. They fall off and cause a massive pain, I have done all the steps necessary here but they are not made for my ear cavity. I raised my concerns immediately through Flipkart’s support app, but the response was painfully slow, with multiple deflections and delays until the return window eventually closed.\n\n\n\n\\--\n\n\n\nThe product was delivered as part of Flipkart’s “open box” policy, where the delivery agent briefly allows you to inspect the item. However, their agent insisted that I “just open the box and let him leave,” giving me no chance to check for heating or fitting issues, which of course only became apparent after trying to use the product. I did try to use but none of these things are visible within that small timeframe, and they keep telling me to approach the freaking service centre. \n\n\n\nWhen I raised the complaint within Flipkart’s support app, I was continuously redirected to the brand, asking me to go through a long service-center verification process. This process, that can easily stretch 20–40 days—a timeline that makes the return policy feel entirely useless, especially for a product that is clearly defective.\n\n  \nI also took this up with the \\*\\*National Consumer Helpline\\*\\* to escalate the matter. Unfortunately, Flipkart has continued to brush off responsibility, pointing to the closed return window, which they themselves allowed to expire due to their mismanagement.\n\n\n\nDespite multiple complaints raised with Flipkart from day one, I received only boilerplate responses until they finally informed me that my complaint was closed due to the return window being over. Their response included the following message:\n\n\n\n\\> “Since the product was delivered on 13 Oct 24 and it’s post return policy, we regret to inform you that the seller will not initiate the return request. We request you to kindly get in touch with the brand. If the brand doesn’t help, kindly share the Job sheet or denial letter. Hence, we are closing the complaint.”\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel that Flipkart has engineered their policies to deny consumers the right to returns, making this process incredibly difficult and stressful. If anyone has advice on what steps I can take—whether through Flipkart or legally—to compel them to resolve this fairly, it would be greatly appreciated. Should I pursue this further with consumer court, or are there any other options I should consider?\n\n\n\nThank you for any guidance.",

Since he is young he doesnt really know what to do or what not to. This lead him to scratch the seat of scooter (not maliciously but as a way to sharpen his claws) . We do have a scratch pad at home but when hes outside he would rather use the scooter seat than come home.  \n\nMain: So today the owner of the said scooter went of the rails. He claims my cat did a lot of damage to his scooter seat. Said he will do something do my cat the next time he see him. So i thought it was an empty threat, dogs barking. But it wasnt. As my cat was coming home he went ballistic. He got a stick and tried to injure my pet. Lucky my cat was fast and escaped. And i saw all this. I gave him a piece of my mind. Asked how can he be so cruel to a small defenseless cat. Why are you so violent over a seat of a scooter. He wasnt having any of it. Finally told him he is mentally ill and he should go to a doctor. That shut him up. He left. I went home after a while . My cat came home.  \n\nSo the deal is what can i do next? the society has cctv but there are few blindspots. If i were to pull my phone the next time his behavior would change. In the verbal exchange he verbatim said he would kill the cats if he has to. I heard it. The watchmen was standing there also heard it (but i dont think hes on our side). Maybe the cameras did too.  \n\nTldr: can I do something against an asshole who has an intention to hurt my pet ?",

        "text": "I know this is the Indian law. But this law made my company pay free money to a lady and the day the lady joined back, she put in her resignation. Isn't this a one sided law that creates more stress on the employer and discourages hiring married women? I feel like I should no longer hire married women because of this one horrible clause. My company is a service based company. People are required to run the business. We make money on margins. It's not a product business that it can scale easily just by increasing quantity of products. My company is not very big to sustain such random expense. Is there a way to navigate around this? I have found a good candidate but she is a married woman. I don't want to keep endlessly going paying out money with no resource + payout + additional employee to get that persons job done. Please help.",

        "text": "So someone suggested me to put this question here so I've reposted the same here.\n\nYup, I guess the title almost explains itself. Actually these days, I have encountered a wave of posts discussing the unfairness of Indian laws towards men.\r  \n\r  \nI'm pretty sure that this topic has been discussed in this sub before, but I couldn't find the post, hence I created one myself.\r  \n\r  \nSo, my question is, if a couple have sex with consent from both the parties, on what parameters can the woman sue the man? If she can, at all?\r  \n\r  \nSecondly, if one has to play it safe, what measure should he take so as to at least nullify at least some, if not the whole charges? Like when I got down to brainstorm, I came up with a stupid idea of getting a voice recording or maybe a chat screenshot where the guy can make it clear that they're having sex with consent/not under the promise of marriage. I know, I know it's a childish solution, but that's all I could think of? Other than this i don't know how can an average male get out of the police case?\r  \n\r  \nLastly, what more solutions are there to protect one self from this tyranny? I'd be grateful if someone can provide me with some stats as to how much do these charges affect one? Like, how much time does it take to nullify the charges, how long is one jailed for, what's the fine imposed etc.\r  \n\r  \nAlso! How many of these charges are actually proven false in the end?\r  \n\r  \nThanks for your time reading this post!\n\n(If anyone has come across this post twice, sorry for the repost!)",

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a 28-year-old man looking for advice on a tough situation in my marriage. Here's what's going on:\n\n- I’ve been married for 8 months, but before that, my wife and I were in a relationship for 4.5 years. After we got married, her behavior changed completely.\n\n\n- She often argues over small things, and sometimes she leaves to stay at her family’s house for days. She doesn’t help with any household chores, so my mom and I do everything. My mom even packs her tiffin for work.\n\n\n- We haven’t had any physical relationship, not before marriage and not after, which has been really hard for me.\n\n\n- Recently, I’ve fallen in love with a 21-year-old woman I’ve known for years. We’re now in a relationship, and we both care deeply for each other. We’re very compatible, even though there’s an age difference.\n\n\n- Because of these issues, I’m thinking about divorcing my wife. But I’m worried she might ask for maintenance or alimony, which I can’t afford to pay. She earns enough to support herself, but not a lot.\n\n\nMy Questions:\n\n\n1. What steps should I take before starting the conversation about divorce with her?\n\n2. How can I protect myself financially if she asks for alimony or maintenance?\n\n3. Or should I stay in this marriage and try to work it out?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

Understanding the reasons behind it can help us find solutions.\n\nMany people don't know what counts as domestic violence. They might think it only includes physical harm, but emotional, sexual, and economic abuse are also forms of violence. Educating people about these forms can help them recognize and stop abuse. Many women depend financially on their husbands or family members. This makes it hard for them to leave an abusive situation. However, it's important to note that men can also be victims of domestic violence, facing abuse from their partners or family members.\n\nVictims of domestic violence often feel scared or ashamed to speak out. They might fear retaliation from the abuser or judgement from society. Creating a supportive environment where victims feel safe to share their experiences is important. There are laws against domestic violence, but they are not always enforced strictly. Victims may face obstacles when trying to get legal protection. Domestic violence continues because of cultural norms, a lack of awareness, economic dependence, fear, inadequate laws, social stigma, substance abuse, and a lack of support services.",

They gave me a blank page and told me to sit outside and write a letter about everything I told them. \n\nI came out, my lawyer asked me ‘Did he gave you the complainant’s name or what complaint is filed?’ I said ‘No’ so my lawyer got furious and immediately called a Senior officer she knew and explained him the whole situation. Then the Senior made some call and we came to know that The Girl has complained that ‘I HAVE MADE FALSE MARRIAGE PROMISE TO HER AND I HAVE MADE OUR INTIMATE PHOTOS VIRAL’ .\n \nMy lawyer was furious at me but I told her there is no such thing. I submitted the letter and got out of there, I was called the next morning at 11Am. Next day me and my mom visited the office where they again made me write an apology letter and sent me home. I was given a warning and they told me only reason we’re letting you go is bcoz the Officer who called yesterday is a highly decorated officer. They also told me they’ll be watching me .\n\nAfter this, My Friend and his Girlfriend came to meet us at our home. Luckily my mom was present, they shamelessly started arguing with me and they told me how things had got worse for them now but I think they have managed it. Obviously they have told another lie or story but her in-laws and father still don’t know the TRUTH. They have requested me that if I get a call from her in-laws or father then please don’t tell about our relationship and just say sorry I have made a mistake. I have recorded the conversation and will be meeting with my lawyer soon and discuss what are the possible legal actions here.\n\nMostly even we don’t want any legal trouble, Just live and let live.

They deliver you wrong items, sometimes items missing completely & at other times, they cheat you with providing misinformation on their website misleading consumers to buy those products but in reality they're fake items.\nI ordered a Phillips MG5930/65 trimmer from amazon.in on 2nd Oct, 2024 where it clearly mentions on their website '3 Year Warranty', but the product which was delivered to me on 3rd Oct, 2024 clearly states '2 year worldwide guarantee'. Got a different information from what was promised.\nContacted their so-called great customer service support agents on the app via phone calls & they were so unsupportive. At the same time, each of them were providing different contradicting information which was really annoying. Was also promised & assured yesterday that I'll get the replacement product which specifically mentions 3 years warranty & also a warranty card with invoice supporting the same. But it didn't happen today, wasted a total of 5 hours on calls with 8 different agents & the last one with whom I spoke today said they can only provide the refund & raise a complaint against the seller to rectify the information on their website. This isn't the resolution I'm looking for.\nMind you this trimmer ain't cheap compared to the other ones being sold on their website. Also, contacted Philips customer support & even they confirmed that it's only 2 years & amazon has mentioned it wrongly.\nSuch harassment calls for a compensation in the form of apology. Hence, filed a grievance at 'national consumer helpline' portal seeking resolution for this matter as amazon simply said they can't do anything except providing refund for the item.\nWhat about the countless hours I spent surfing through hundreds of items on amazon to finalize this particular one based on the warranty provided which turned out to be false one. Complete bogus. This isn't a trivial matter which they stated. What if someone purchases a laptop or an electric bike online with the premise of good warranty coverage of the aforementioned time but in reality it turns out to be something else altogether. This is completely misleading & totally cheating on consumers. Such unwarranted harassment.\nDo I need to do anything else to raise awareness on this matter. Please help me with this.

I overheard the conversation, and my parents seem uninterested in meeting her family, offering excuses to delay everything.

From my perspective, three months should be enough time for them to meet her and her family. However, my parents are saying they need six months to a year to \"observe\" the situation, and they're making excuses like, \"You'll suffer a lot in the future with this girl.\" It feels they are delaying everything intentionally so our relationship will get break with time. \n\n# Further Complications:\n\n- My parents won’t allow us to follow her religion. Even if they initially agree, I know they'll pressure me daily to follow our family's religion, which I don’t want to deal with.\n\n- The biggest concern my parents have is that they think I'll leave home after a few months of marriage to live separately, they don't even let my brother get settled in other state where he works. He stay home 15 days and rest 15 days in other state. His wife stay home 15 days without her husband but my parents don't care. My parents just want their children in their home at any cost. \n\n- My brother once slapped his wife, and my father has had physical fights with my mother on two occasions.\n\n# What I Want:\n\n- Ideally, I would like to marry my girlfriend as per her father’s wishes for a big wedding. However, explaining my toxic family situation to him is very difficult. Even with a big wedding, we can’t live in my parents' home due to the toxicity.\n\n- Another option is to run away and get married without involving anyone else. Her mother knows everything and is supportive of us.\n\nGiven all of this, I’m unsure how to proceed and what are legalities involved because my parents will try their best to drag me home even if I runaway with her after marriage. If you have some doubts I'll clear. Please help.\n\nEdits - Removed pedophile part. Also, me and my gf doing business together. We are earning well. (Adding this point). I don't want to leave the city I'm in so one thing I can do living in same city but lie that I left city and living in Bangalore now. So they won't trouble me. ",

        "text": "TLDR: A friend of my girlfriend secretly snooped through phone and took her private photos and kept it in pendrive.\n\nSo a few days ago I came to knowledge about a pendrive that was found in my hostel. Apparently it had folders of name of girls from our college and one of them was my girlfriend's folder. There stuff from varying degree. At first when my girlfriend heard the news she became suicidal at the thought and wanted to kill herself. There was this idea that someone hacked into her Snapchat or something. When she checked the pendrive herself, it wasn't bad to the level she thought were much more revealing pictures in her hide my eyes. The guy was only able to access the photos that were in the 'memories'. There far more worse pictures of other girls. Tbh this guy was close friends to some level to all of them and maybe at some point had passwords to phones. He seemed like a pretty fine guy so they didn't mind much. I do agree that it maybe the girls faults to why let anyone take there phones and could've more careful about there private being in easily accessible places. That 'guy' had been repeatedly doing this for like an year so....I did notice when how casually he would use my girl's phone, but I was fine friends only. Later when I checked her phone and realised what photos she didn't set private. I did tell and deleted a few of 'em. I wanted to tell what this friend of yours saw something, i just didn't wanna make her paranoid. And was like maybe unintentionally he might have seen and decided not to make a big deal about it, I wanted to be the secure boyfriend, curse me for being open minded.\nCurrently we are in possession of that pendrive and the 'guy' who has it , he is aware that he has lost something.\nI wanna take strict legal action, there is a high probability that the pendrive is the only source he had and no backups , but still can't be sure. Also we can't be sure if he's the only one who has seen. Can you check if the pendrive has been used on someone else's devices?\nAlso what other precautions and steps should I take regarding matter. I would welcome all and any kind of suggestions on how to ruin someone's life.",

She wasn’t wearing seat belt because the belt was bothering my son. There were few traffic cops on the road and one cop indicated me to pull over.\n1. He mentioned that my wife is not wearing sear belt and its a violation of traffic rules (i agree to this)\n2. He mentioned that my son should not be seated on front passenger seat because it makes it dangerous driving scenario (please confirm if it is true or he simply bluffed me)\n3. He mentioned that he will make a challan of 2k and then anyone in maharashtra will not stop me anymore, he sounded like a salesman here, later he mentioned that he will make it 1500.\n4. I requested him to give me the challan then he mentioned that i will get it over sms later, i said i can wait, then he asked my phone number and i received one message of e challan, it also had one link to pay challan online, traffic cops insisted that i should pay by cash and payment for this challan is settled. He didn’t let me open the link in message. I paid 1000rs cash to him, he didn’t give any receipt and told me that challan is settled.\nWhen i reached home and checked the link, i found that challan is active and unpaid. \n5. My car has dash-cam and it records audio but unfortunately the 12v plug had got unplugged during this ordeal, when i pushed the plug to start the cam, traffic cop mentioned that i have been cooperative and he will let go of second violation and i can leave.\n\nTLDR:\nSo basically he issued an e challan, i didn’t know that i have to pay online, he took 1k from me, lied to me that challan is settled but he kept those 1k for himself, and i have to make online payment for the challan\n\nI have few questions.\n1. Is there any rule as such that a kid / toddler cannot sit on front passenger seat, does it make a dangerous driving situation?? What should we do if traffic police bluff by stating such things?\n2. How many types of challans are there (RTO, traffic) are there any types as such ?? If so how can we make sure that payment is done successfully without letting these scammers put this money in their pocket??\n",

Later this was moved onto telegram where they added me to a group of three and told there will be three tasks further which had to be done without break and at the end total amount can be withdrawn. Task began with investing 38k and second was to invest 4 lakh. Later he said I brought a wrong share and didn’t follow his instructions so all of us have to pay more to cover it so we did. The last task was 8 lakh. After this one member could withdraw amount, posted screenshot and left. For me and one more guy, he said our accounts are not vip level and should be to withdraw amount and demanded more 8 lakhs after which the other guy could withdraw and he left. But he said I gave an error bank account number and my account is freezed for which I was asked to pay. Seeing other two people getting their amount I trusted and paid. He again said account if unfreezed but funds are lying freely so a vip account has to be made to claim these are yours to which I said we already did so many transactions so it should be a proof so he said it’s the banks rule and promised this is last. This was charged a hefty amount too after which again he says tax has to be paid. I created an issue as he keeps breaking promises all the time and I can’t trust anymore and asked him to return all raw amount without profit and he doesn’t agree and demands more to get back all money. He gives an agreement from some company called HCL software and bitcoin exchange saying this is last but it was a forged document. I have filed complaint with cyber police last Monday. The so called trading was being done on a fake website called nvidia. If anyone has been through this and got back your money by battling, please suggest a way out for me to recover as much as possible as I had taken multiple loans to pay the scam and the emis now are way more than my salary. The police is being very slow and there’s no help I get from them. Thanks in advance! \n\n\nEdit: 1. I had reached out to police immediately and they took the complaint but took the FIR a month later. So I had been struggling to fill in EMIs and for my own daily basic needs too. Political power also did not help as elections are on and no one is in power. Last Tuesday an officer called up to let me know they’re investigating and took some details about this. \n\n2. I did not have all the money. As said once I wiped my money and savings, I trusted them due to screenshots and to get back my money, took loans and paid them off in huge amounts thinking I’d get back all my money and can close all the loans. However, I realise this mistake put me into my grave. 😔\n\nAlso please believe that I’m not faking, I can provide all the proofs if any are needed on my personal chat. Thanks, it’s just that I’m desperately looking for help and my friends suggested me to post here on reddit. And I joined here just for this so I do not have any previous posts.\n\nFIR - https://docs.google.com/document/d/104DCnN3pawAifi2xgvwoK0XhpSZ4ayoQyBY48vWvG3g/edit",

I was born and raised in Canada. 2015 was the first time I came to India and Saw her for the first time. She was always complimenting me about my looks and also took me out for lunch twice back then. All was good and I developed a good bond with her. \nIn 2017 I came to India again. Her actions were really changed towards me. She was touching me in a way and understood her intentions. I was naive only 19. She called to stay at her for a night and I agreed even knowing the intentions. Things happened that Night and I still got the recordings. I was here in India for two months and we did it pretty much all the time. When I moved to Canada. I felt very guilty of the acts I have done. \nFast forward to 2020. I came to visit India and got stuck here because of Covid. I stopped talking to her in 2020 and even she was okay with it as I explained what I felt. \nFrom 2020, I am living in India as I loved the country so much this time because I got time to explore everything. \nComing to my Bua, she is unmarried and have had many boyfriends. She left India in 2021 because apparently she found her love of the life, the guy was French and she moved to Denmark with her. I wished her well, she requested for one last time to do it( I am explaining this because I have got call recordings of her telling me this). I agreed. I felt relieved knowing she is now gone and this chapter is closed. \nLast month in April she came back to India because that guy left her. She didn’t marry him btw. During this period when she was not in India, I went back to Canada for a month to help my dad with some business related issues. I started dating this girl who is madly in love with me and she left everything to come with me to India. She has no connections in India apart from me. She’s a white girl. \nThis Bua is now single and want to do stuff with me again which I politely disagreed to. Two days back, she called me saying she wants to marry me and settle with me in Canada. If I disagree she will file rape case against me, even though I have proofs of what happened. She even told me that she will take the matter to my father and whole family. Yesterday at night, she sent our recordings to my girlfriend(who lives with me in India) and destroyed our relationship. She now wanna go back to Canada and doesn’t want me. \nWhat are the remedies I have for this situation. Please help me.\nI don’t want to leave this country. \nI even asked her to settle the matter with money which she disagreed. My only option is to leave India and never come back.\nShe is 48 and I am 24.",

Some of her words and actions have caused so much stress that it affected my mental health so I have slowed communication - and she is aware of this.\n\nShe is now pressuring for details of a spouse visa and that's causing some serious red flags. Is that the only reason she got married and any serious questions I asked about planning for the future were answered with lies? Now every time we talk, it causes more confusion than creates clarity. She seems oblivious to the fact that communication is down to once a week and is just constantly bombarding with emotional messages.\n\nI don't think I can afford to give her the benefit of doubt and sponsor her because of these red flags. I don't believe we have a matrimonial home in the legal sense as I am abroad and she is in India with her mum and siblings.

        "text": "This post is based on my understanding of the **Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill, 2024**. If there are any mistakes or inaccuracies, please let me know in the comments! I'm happy to learn and discuss. 😊\n\n# Uttarakhand Implements Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in 2024\n\nThe Uttarakhand government has introduced the **Uniform Civil Code (UCC)**, making it the first Indian state to adopt a unified legal framework for all its residents. This law simplifies and regulates matters like **marriage, divorce, inheritance**, and **live-in relationships**, ensuring everyone is treated equally under the same set of laws, regardless of their religion or cultural practices.\n\n# Key Points of the UCC\n\n1. **Marriage Rules:**\n   * Both partners must be **unmarried** at the time of marriage.\n   * Minimum age for marriage: **21 years for men, 18 years for women.**\n   * Marriage between close relatives (prohibited relationships) is not allowed unless permitted by specific customs, and those customs must not go against public policy.\n2. **Polygamy Banned:**\n   * Polygamy is **prohibited for everyone**, including communities where it was previously allowed (e.g., Muslim personal laws).\n   * Only **monogamous marriages** will be legally valid under the UCC.\n3. **Mandatory Marriage Registration:**\n   * Every marriage, even if solemnized outside Uttarakhand, must be registered with the authorities if at least one partner is a resident of the state.\n   * Marriages conducted since **2010** must also be registered retroactively.\n4. **Live-in Relationships:**\n   * Couples in live-in relationships must register their partnership within **30 days** of living together.\n   * **Children born from live-in relationships are considered legitimate** and will have inheritance rights.\n   * Women deserted by live-in partners can claim **financial support (maintenance)** through the courts.\n5. **Equal Inheritance Rights:**\n   * Both sons and daughters are given **equal inheritance rights** to their parents’ property, ensuring gender equality.\n6. **Religious Freedom for Ceremonies:**\n   * Couples can marry following their own religious or customary traditions, such as **Saptapadi, Nikah, Holy Union**, or **Anand Karaj.**\n\n# Who Does It Apply To?\n\n* The UCC applies to **all residents of Uttarakhand**, even those living outside the state.\n* **Scheduled Tribes** and groups with **protected customary practices** under the Constitution are exempt from this Code.\n\n# What Changes Under the UCC?\n\nThe UCC replaces personal laws based on religion with a **common set of rules** for everyone. For example:\n\n* Practices like **polygamy** are no longer allowed.\n* There is now a standardized procedure for marriage, divorce, and property inheritance.\n* Women in both marriages and live-in relationships have clear legal protections.\n\nFINE AND IMPRISONMENT \n\n* Under the Uttarakhand UCC, 2024, failing to submit a live-in relationship statement can result in:\n\nFine: Up to ₹10,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 3 months.\n\nProviding false information or ignoring notices can lead to stricter penalties, including:\n\nFine: Up to ₹25,000.\n\nImprisonment: Up to 6 months.",

So yesterday i had Sahodaya examination and i forgot to keep my phone on the teachers table , during the last 15 Minutes of the exam I was just laying down then this Invigilation teacher was walking around the room and saw me with my phone hanging out of my pocket. Now , i was not aware that i had my phone with me as i thought that i had already submitted my phone on the table. The Invigilation teacher confiscated my phone and she is also the Senior coordinator so she asked me to collect my phone from the head mistress after the exam was over. I went over to the staff room to collect my phone, the Head Mistress was absent and i was told to go back home and that i would not be receiving my phone the same day. They also told me that they were going to call my parents and unless they do that I was not going to get my phone back. So i did not get my phone yesterday and they treated me like a piece of shit for having my phone in my pocket. They thought i was copying with it and told me that i cannot be trusted, each classroom has 1 CCTV Camera which I am not aware is they work or not but I swear i didn't know that my phone was still in my pocket. Now that was yesterday and after my mom got back home from work they asked her to meet them today to collect my previous exam answer sheets and get my phone back. They informed her today that the sheets will be sent home by students and i would get my phone the end of this month. I am pissed and angry at the teachers because the only way i communicate with my parents is with my phone and i have no other means to do so , I also commute to school by metro everyday and from the station i sometimes take an auto home. I read that its not legal for school to hold a student's phone with them for more than a day ; they either have to return the phone during the working hours of the school or had it over to parents the same day if the student is a minor. Now I searched the web seeking help from people who have went through the same situation; write an apology letter and apologize to the teacher or file a case on the school with the help of the police is what is found. Would appreciate some advice on what is to be done. FYI I did not keep that phone with me to copy or anything i completely forgot that it was even in my pocket man and knowing there is a CCTV camera recording i would not copy!",

Recently a week ago, a girl probably a couple of years elder to me cam for walking in the same stadium. All the people who run/walk do it in the same direction. But she alone walks in the opposite direction and it is super annoying to me. The track is not wide. Most of the track is filled with grass apart from a small patch which is not covered with grass because of people running over that same path. So basically only one can go. As I am working on myself to achieve running milestones, I run a bit faster. Whenever she comes in front of me, she doesnt move an inch so I move just enough to avoid a crash. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA couple fo days ago, we had an argument. She said I am the only one who doesnt leave her space and stuff. I asked her why she's the only one to walk in opposite direction and she argued there is no such rule to walk in a praticular direction. I didnt talk much, ignored an continued my running as the stopwatch was running. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNothing much has happened since. I keep running the same way but she gets annoyed everytime I pass her. I guess we are somewhere close to having another verbal arguement soon. Given the provisions for women, she might file a harassment case against me. I am ready to battle it out legally for all the men around. We have never ever crashed into each other only because I take precaution to avoid her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould I call 100 and explain my story of a potential case against me or write an email to the police just incase things go down? I dont know much legal stuff but if you guys think I can win a case, I am ready to fight it out legally no matter how many years/money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso this is a very very petty thing but I just wanted to know your thoughts.

But I didn't receive it , I called them and they asked me to wait till 10pm next day but no signs of package. In fact, the audacity of the delivery agent to put up false information saying he attempted delivery is even more frustrating. Had to call customer service like 5-6 times regarding this and they asked me to place an order again whatever the differential amount be , would be given in Amazon pay balance.  So I placed the order again and it costed me 5,399 rs extra than the sale price . I placed this order on 9th October, 2024 and it was supposed to arrive on 13th but again no signs of delivery. I've been calling these guys almost 4 times since 14th , all they tell me is to wait till 10pm each day for the order. It's absolutely ridiculous and very frustrating.  They have also been telling me they are having a shortage of manpower due to the sale periods but it's honestly not my lookout as a customer.  I'm not responsible for their operations department.  Its been 4 days delay now ( 18/19 days in total) . I have to call customer service daily from my side, zero accountability from these guys . The audacity of these guys to even end the call abruptly without proper explanation is frustrating.  Anyone has solution for this issue ??",

        "text": "In the recent couple of months, I've noticed that Amazon India is harassing customers unnecessarily & indulging in fraud activities. They deliver you wrong items, sometimes items missing completely & at other times, they cheat you with providing misinformation on their website misleading consumers to buy those products but in reality they're fake items.\nI ordered a Phillips MG5930/65 trimmer from amazon.in on 2nd Oct, 2024 where it clearly mentions on their website '3 Year Warranty', but the product which was delivered to me on 3rd Oct, 2024 clearly states '2 year worldwide guarantee'. Got a different information from what was promised.\nContacted their so-called great customer service support agents on the app via phone calls & they were so unsupportive. At the same time, each of them were providing different contradicting information which was really annoying. Was also promised & assured yesterday that I'll get the replacement product which specifically mentions 3 years warranty & also a warranty card with invoice supporting the same. But it didn't happen today, wasted a total of 5 hours on calls with 8 different agents & the last one with whom I spoke today said they can only provide the refund & raise a complaint against the seller to rectify the information on their website. This isn't the resolution I'm looking for.\nMind you this trimmer ain't cheap compared to the other ones being sold on their website. Also, contacted Philips customer support & even they confirmed that it's only 2 years & amazon has mentioned it wrongly.\nSuch harassment calls for a compensation in the form of apology. Hence, filed a grievance at 'national consumer helpline' portal seeking resolution for this matter as amazon simply said they can't do anything except providing refund for the item.\nWhat about the countless hours I spent surfing through hundreds of items on amazon to finalize this particular one based on the warranty provided which turned out to be false one. Complete bogus. This isn't a trivial matter which they stated. What if someone purchases a laptop or an electric bike online with the premise of good warranty coverage of the aforementioned time but in reality it turns out to be something else altogether. This is completely misleading & totally cheating on consumers. Such unwarranted harassment.\nDo I need to do anything else to raise awareness on this matter. Please help me with this.

        "text": "A little background about myself(this would be relevant for later). I am an Engineering student from a TIER-1 engineering college(NON-IIT/BITS) in my 4th year. I belong to a rather poor family with no income source, an alcoholic abusive father, a very very burnt out mother and a bed ridden elder brother due to medical conditions.I have taken a good sum as education loan and chose this path for a better future for myself and mostly my family.\n\nI met my girlfriend in my 3rd semester. It was rather quick and we started dating. I didn't think much about it as it was a first timer for me and I was very naive so it happened quicker than I could imagine. Over the past 2 years things have got really bad. I discovered she was very suicidal and depressed a couple of months after we started dating. She is from a well off family but slightly conservative nuclear family with a few issues. She is extremely depressed(clinically I believe) and suicidal. My entirety of college life went in taking care of this, which made sure that my grades sink. I spent no time doing anything else and I have become mentally and physically exhausted. All of my time is spent in convincing her not to do the thing or helping her to not go deeper into it. I dedicated myself to this because I believed I could fix the issue. I tried to get her some professional help which didnt last long due to the appointments taking too long. I tried contacting her parents and while they took it seriously for a couple of days, they brushed it off later. They fail to understand the gravity of it.\n\nNow whenever I withdraw attention to focus on anything productive, she goes through even worse episodes and it taxes me emotionally more. A third of my entire college life was spent out at night, at 4 AM, trying to console her. This has become a burden as my familial and financial condition is horrible too and the idea of putting my college life to a waste and not getting a good job by the end of the year will really be horrible.\n\nMy girlfriend has suggested me to break up with her although I have stalled it because I am afraid that if I leave, she might do something very stupid. She has no social life or any friends. How can I get away with this situation? I want to leave as well and I am incredibly scared. \n\nI can not tell my parents about any of this for it will be a hell. Conveying this would not only take away the only hope that keeps my mother pushing but also invite a very ugly and irrational decision from my alcoholic father. I struggle for literal hundreds of rupees and so thats an angle to take care of as well.\n\nI am looking for legal advice and opinions.",

Here’s what happened:\n\nI booked a cab from Gurugram to New Delhi Railway Station. The driver  intentionally took a wrong turn to save toll of Rs.100  which was already included in the fare, causing me to miss my train. To make matters worse, I was charged an extra amount for the ride.\n\nWhen I contacted Rapido’s support, they acknowledged that the driver made a mistake and refunded the increased fare amount, but only as a credit to their in-app wallet—not back to my original payment method.\n\nHere’s what I’m seeking:\n\n1. A formal apology from Rapido for the inconvenience caused.\n2. A full refund of the fare back to my source account.\n\nI believe I have a valid case due to the negligence of the driver and the company’s handling of the situation. I’m considering legal action but wanted to get some insights from others who may have dealt with similar issues. What steps should I take next? Is it worth pursuing legal action, or should I explore other avenues first?\n\nAny advice or experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

        "text": "As the heading says, my cousin (19F) shouted me in front of my whole family this morning, me tumhe barbad kar dungi, jante nhi ho tum mujhe. These are her literal words . My mother is bit scared because of this . I don't know what to do, should I be worried about this?\n\nHere is the back story; So I will not say that we are pretty close, she is the chipku and nosy type, always stalking my private life. She knew about my relationship and mujhe bhi paata tha uske baare me . And she has sent me some of her intimate photos with her boyfriend(hugging, kissing on the cheek etc..)which I didnt ask her. But uske paas mera na koi photo tha na koi proof. Bus she had a name.  Now few months back, she got exposed, jab videocall pe baat kar rhi thi tab uski maami ne dekh liya or khub pitai ki uski. Then she used me as a shield, ki jab bhai aeysa kar rha hai to me kyu nhi kar sakta. Tab gharwale mere pe bhi gussa karne lage, ye to mera kismat achha tha ki mene apni girlfriend ko mere ghar pe introduce kar rakha tha (2 saal pehle ki baat hai ye jab mera breakup nhi hua tha and mere gharwale usse jaante the as a friend of mine). So itna kuch effect nhi pada mere family pe and ab jab breakup ho gya hai mera , mere gharwale jaante hai uske baare me . \n\nFirst forword today, all of my family members are having a small get together. So out of nowhere her topic came out and she started to use me as a shield . Bus wo bolti rhi ki jo bhaiya kar rhe hai wo galat nhi hai to me jab karu to galat kya hai etc etc.. and then I just told her, tu bahat bol rhi hai tab se, ab me bolu? All of a sudden she started crying jese ki mene usse pit diya ho. Fir rote rote bole lagi ki me tumhe barbad kar dungi, jante nhi ho mujhe. Ese bol ke fir rone lagi. Fir gharwalo ne saant kiya usse.. lekin meri mummy tab se dari hui hai, kahin kuch galt bol diya to fans jaunga me. And you know the justice system nowadays.\n\nSo I am asking what should I do now? Should I be worried? Actually wo thodi si muhfaad hai, so we doubt ki fir kabhi kisi aur ke saamne bol diya to dikkat ho jaegi .. what should I do now? I already blocked her from everything and I still have her photos with her boyfriend. Any precautions should I take ??\n\ntl;dr- my cousin (19f) shouted at me (23m) that I will destroy you in front of my whole family. My mom is worried since morning . What should I do now ? Should I be worried?",

        "title": "Filing DV Case Against My Ex-husband - Possibilities and Outcomes",
        "text": "I was first married back in April 2019. Nothing was normal with that guy. He was a PubG addict and would spend all night playing game on his mobile or watching movies on his mobile, and no sex or no interaction as well whatsoever. I even told him if he had any issues, we could consult a doctor but treating me like I don't exist wasn't okay. Days went on and things became worse as I was not even able to sleep peacefully due to the noise he made (talking with other players loudly) while playing PubG. I told him to at least give me the basic human need of sound sleep, however he became abusive verbally and also started body shaming me and harassing me. If I talked anything, he would start abusing me. I later found out he had unfinished past relationship where the girl refused to marry him but they were continuing communication even after he got married to me. Within a few days, as I started digging and finding out more truths about him, he started hitting me. The abuse turned more violent and physical. Then in June 2019, just two months after marriage, he hit me so bad that I was scared for my life. He kicked my head, my eyes, slapped me and kept hitting me until his mom came and asked him why he was hitting me. His mom never asked him to stop, she only asked him why. In this moment of his distraction, I ran, locked myself in the bathroom and called my parents, fearing for my life and left that house that very day. He was so tall and broad and strong that I couldn't even have any kind of self defence for myself that day. \n\nI then applied for divorce and the unregistered two months marriage took 2.5 years to get dissolved legally, despite us not living together or having contact after those two months. \n\nI wanted to get out of that abusive and draining marriage legally and as soon as possible and hence I did not press any DV charges (also because I was terrified and scared of him). I also did not ask any alimony or maintainance as I wanted out of it without dragging the case for years. Without asking anything itself, the case took 2.5 years to complete. \n\nThree years after the divorce, I got married to another man and we're happy. My now husband knows all about what I went through and is a good man who appreciates and cherishes my every bit of existence.\n\nNow the problem is that I always have felt I never got any kind of justice for what I went through because of him. He just like that came in an arranged marriage setup, married me, made my life hell, abused me verbally and physically, hit me to the point of me fearing for my life, but none of it never affected anything in him or his life. Me, on the other hand, am still suffering due to all the trauma he caused me. 5.5 years down the line since that deadly physical assault, I still have sleepless nights and am still facing trauma due to it. I want closure, I want him to pay for what he did. I don't want any money from him, but I want him to be legally held responsible for what he has caused me for the rest of my life. I don't have any proof of that assault as back then all people convinced me against going to police or filing a complaint on him. He will agree to the assault proudly if questioned by anyone any time. He's always been proud of all the assaults he did to me, because according to him, men are entitled to treat their wives however they want. I want closure and I want to get out of this trauma of not having a closure and him not being held responsible for what he has done. \n\nWhat are my options here and how can I go about it? Again, money isn't my motive here, I want him to be held responsible and have closure to the ever lingering feeling of the injustice caused to me.\n\nEdit: \nTo people asking why I married him - Lol! Looks like you don’t have much idea about the arranged marriage setup in India. It was one such arranged marriage, and there were a lot of lies from the groom’s side and his family. I didn't get to spend time with him or the family before marrying him. I started knowing things and uncovering their lies once I started living with him. Of course if I had known prior, I wouldn’t have got into it.\n\nTo people calling it a rage bait - This is my first post here. I infact had to google what a rage bait was. Whatever I wrote was just expressing what I know about my ex-husband and is NOT meant to trigger people around. In fact, it'd be good if the triggers don't comment here and create a whole bunch of useless stuff in comments to read. ",

        "text": "I recently got to know that My wife lied about her marital status in passport. \n\nMarital Background: \n\n-We changed her surname in Aadhar card from her parents’ to mine after marriage.\n\n-Things in marriage got complicated\n\n-She filed false false 498a and dv against me and my family.\n\n-she decided to move to USA for studies (as every woman who cannot show their face in society after filing false cases).\n\n-Applied for passport at this point as she did not have passport. At this point, her Aadhar still has my surname.\n\n-She takes IELTS, applies to colleges, gets into one etc\n\n-Applied for visa\n\n-we filed for mutual divorce with the understanding that she will withdraw the case. It is mentioned in mutual divorce affidavit that she should withdraw the case.\n\n-she still hasn’t withdrawn the cases\n\n-She flies off to USA in august 2023\n\n-Now i get to know in feb 2024 that she is not able to go embassy to give statement via Video conferencing. Upon drilling down, i got a hint that she has lied in her passport application that she is unmarried. This made me wonder, if she could go to that extent, her disdain for me could not allow her to take my surname in her passport. She could have somehow manipulated Aadhar as well.\n\nAlso, her family has a criminal and political background.\n\n\n**My question is, can she go back to passport office and tell the officials that it was a mistake? Or will it considered a crime  no matter what. **\n\n\nEdit: i dont think people are understanding the point here. For me to give her divorce, she has to withdraw cases, obviously. For that to happen, she has to go to embassy for video conference, which she can’t do because when she claimed she is unmarried how come she has filed 498a (the embassy will ask). I think i might have touched some feminists’ ultra sensitive parts here. But i haven’t filed a single false case against this woman, yet. Only she has. \n\nEdit 2: people are also missing the point that how could she have changed the surname in aadhar card before divorce? If she has given duplicate or older aadhar card, that is a bigger crime isn’t it?\n\n#passportlaw #indianpassport #passportfraud",

        "title": "Fake allegations by maid",
        "text": "I Originally posted on r/IndianLaw. \n\nThis could be long but please read it.\n\nGuys I need help on next step. So Today my maid(f40+) called my brother saying that my father(71, teacher for over 50years) grabbed her hand when she was moping upstairs. He immediately asked for Proof to which she said she don't have my but she'll provide next time. And this app happened on 9th June.\n\nBut in reality she never moped upstairs however she went up to take a shit. When my father was busy laying clothes. She came out of the toilet and he asked her why she said shes going to mop when she is doing potty.\n\nA little bit of the background: we have know her and her mother for over 26 years. She has. son who's been to jail for a few month last year. and. daughter. my father has always treated her like a daughter. When he got severe COVID and his legs stopped working her mother used to help in excercising his legs. He is dependent on insulin for life. He other lower abdomen problems as well. I mean he's 70. However he still teaches students which includes girls as well.\n\nAnyways,Now what we've decided is not to do\nanything as there literally no truth to her story. And we'll let her go in 2 months since she comes late at work all the time. But I want to know if this is the right thing to do. What if she put on some fake injuries or something. But also she's been working since 9. And no CCTV footage is not available for Upstairs.Just the Gate maybe.\n\n\nEdit/Update: so as decided not to react we didnt when this evening after all the allegations it was just my mother and i alone at home when she came late again and drank her evening tea which we offer daily. She didn't say a word but talked about why she was late and how she found out that her bank branch shifted. shes only contacted my brother who she knows work. she doesn't know i work too. Its beyond my mental capacity why she confided in him of all the people. He doesn't even talk to her like at all.\n\nbut we are firing her this month and we have multiple reason that have been lingering for months now. she is extra late nowadays probably some new work. her work takes not more than 15 minutes to complete and in the evening it's even less. Besides her taking time to shit. \n\nand as to her evidence she said she'll call my brother to show her audio. but there will be no next time. We stopped allowing her to use the restroom upstairs coz it's reserved for the tenant. but that alleged day she insisted on going upstairs. a separate toilet is available for the outsiders downstairs too. but she didn't use it. i don't know why. that day our tenant wasn't there.\n\n\nanyways as for the cameras everyone is saying. i don't think it'll be of help. because to install a camera in a room just doesn't seem right. and we are never allowing her upstairs ever again. even if she goes upstair no way my father is going too for sure.\n\nUpdate 2: so she did her work and all never talked to me or anyone except once specified time to my brother. Yesterday her son got arrested and his friends were arrested a day before. Today she came on time because my mother has been telling her to do so. She even asked me to dial up her lawyers she illiterate and she's also a widow with 2 kids which includes a minor girl. All this makes this story sad and it is. Also she is completely blind in one eye. \n\nHowever, Today after she went away i installed true caller in my brother's phone. i know this sounds lame. Anyways he had earlier blocked her number on the 13th when she called first. Yesterday 14th june around 3 pm her son went to jail. Day before yesterday i.e. 13th her son's jail bird friends were taken in custody. Now having installed true caller i found out she has missed called him 3 times around 4-4:30pm, 1 call came from a lawyer too. i don't know if that was her lawyer or not. Today in the morning when she came to work she didn't ask my brother about why he didn't pick up. I made him and my father sit with me. If she really wanted justice she could've called him out right then. Further, she asked me to call up her lawyer. So according to me she knew about her son getting caught so she thought of blaming an old man who can't even walk properly, been on ducasteride for years his testosterone levels are low af, alive because of insulin, partially blind in one eye all this just so she could extract money from us. \nAnd no she never talked to my mother and i or even our extended family where she works. She specifically told my brother not to tell my mother. Because it was all a lie. it was never about my father or the accusations she made on him. it was probably just the money. Damn.\n\nPS: this is my last post from this account",

When he reach on our front side me and my gf don’t look anything suspicious.My girlfriend ask him to delete videos but he said he didn’t take any of it.Im sure he took some video of us scuffling(atleast) when he opens the door.\nFast forward 10-15mins after he let us go after me and my gf begs him saying we won’t do again. Maybe he didn’t escalate the situation because he lacks evidence ?????\nNote- when he first confronted us,he told me he saw us kissing and my gf giving me a bj but I’m sure that as he is looking from behind our car its not fully visible with all the back side seat being at a heightened level then the front seat and with all the head rest and when he reached the front seat we looked as if we did nothing.Before leaving he tell us both me and gf to call him after reaching home to know that we are safe and to drive home safely.From my gut feeling he seems a genuinely good guy.During the confrontation,he take me to a temple nearby to promise on the god of the temple that I marry my gf(of 3 years) or else let the god take my life away.\nThen he called us at night,the 3 of us talk for 10-20 mins,he is explaining how such horrible things happen at that place(it was our very first time at that place,we thought that there are no people nearby, we don’t know such things happen).He said their community member scold him as to why he didn’t bring us to their community hall and give some pusihments to us.He told us he lied to them and even deleted our numbers in case they look into his phone.\n\nMy question- what can I do if he uploads the videos on the internet like Facebook ?(He told us that he didn’t take any video, I’m sure he did take some video even if it is not a clear visual one.)If the video is on Internet then our lives will be ruined,we won’t be able to live anymore,we will lose all respect.My gf said she won’t live anymore.My conscience says that even if he has the video,it will be all from behind our car in which we can’t be seenproperly.but our initial confrontations will be all seen in that video,of us begging him ewe are sorry.\nPlease give some advice.\n",

So she asked me to make a paypal account, so that they will use my paypal as their payment option, and then I will transfer the money to them and keep my cut.\n\nThis work has lucrative money. And I am not exactly rich, or even middle class.  \n**But I am fully aware of the dangers this idea might have.**\n\nI don't have anyone whom I can ask for advice regarding this matter. So I am here to ask the feasibility of this idea from people who have the know-how of the law and the taxation codes.\n\nI know this sounds like money-laundering plain and simple, but just for a moment imagine it isn't, and the sales are not of illicit stuff (which I hope and trust they aren't). Is there a way to make this work while remaining within the laws and rules?  \nWould just paying taxes on time work, or would we need to make a company or something?  \n**Again I don't intend to break the law** but at the same time I want to work with them in a legally sound way.\n\nI believe the pain points would be the reason for wire transfer, and what is the product we(or I) are selling.",

Recently, I was the victim of task fraud and my bank account got frozen. It was a stressful experience, but luckily, I was able to get things sorted out with the help of an expert. He explained the situation to me clearly and helped me take the necessary steps to get my account unfrozen.\n\nThis incident started when I received a message on WhatsApp saying that they will send me money for posting reviews on Google Maps. Out of curiosity, I posted the review and they sent me the money. I felt something was off and said that I was not interested and blocked that person. However, the damage was already done and that transaction was flagged by Gujrat Cyber Crime cell and my account was Frozen.\n\nMy account was frozen on 1st March and due to it my savings was stuck in the account and with no way of retrieving my funds, I was in distress. I tried to contact my bank but they just told me that it was blocked by the Gujrat Cyber-Crime cell and that there wasn't anything they could do. I tried to contact the Cyber Crime cell but they didn't respond to my calls or emails. \n\nUltimately, I found Mr. Jeeth on reddit and I and contacted him about my issue. I provided him with my account details and he was able to pull the details of my case. After getting the details, we coordinated and he explained the situation to me in detail. He also told me how I needed to proceed in order to get my account unfreeze. I shared all the relevant documents with him for the verification process and my account was unfreeze after a week's time.\n\n**Important:** I am only able to share this information after getting explicit permission from Mr Jeeth (rule-9). Also if anyone wants to contact him, you can do so at u/Bankfreezeexpert . Again, This is just genuine advise that you should seek the help of professionals and I am not promoting or advertising anybody (rule-8).",

        "text": "I’m looking for legal advice about my main Reddit account, u/DishantChandra, being banned after being accused of breaking Rule 3. The message from the reddit admin said: *\"After reviewing, we found that you broke Rule 3 because you shared intimate media of someone without their consent.\"* This is a total lie – I never shared any intimate media, links, or images.\n\nHere’s the situation:  \nI made a post on r/Tantra to raise concerns about the subreddit’s moderators being involved with NSFW subreddits while running a faith-based subreddit. All I did was post a title with my concerns – no images, links, or media, and no description box used. In fact, the subreddit's automod removed my post with the message: *\"Your post has been removed because there is little or no content in the text body.\"* This shows I didn’t post any media or intimate content.\n\nDespite this, I was still banned under Rule 3. I appealed, but the ban was upheld, and Reddit hasn’t responded to my emails or given any other explanation. It feels like they’re just backing up a false claim with no evidence.\n\nI get that the issue of moderators running NSFW subreddits while managing a faith-based one is a grey area, and I’m not saying it’s right or wrong. But what doesn’t make sense is why the mods of r/Tantra were so hurt by my post, and why Reddit admins are supporting their false accusations without evidence. It’s obvious I don’t fit their narrative, and they’re just silencing me.\n\nThis looks like part of a larger pattern of bias and censorship against Hindus. I’m being punished for expressing a valid concern, and there’s no real reason for it other than to shut me down.\n\nIf I don’t get this resolved, I’m planning to take legal action, starting with consumer court and moving on to the high court if necessary.\n\nHere’s the [link to the removed post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tantra/comments/1i3mjfp/removed_by_reddit/)\n\nAny advice on how to take this further or escalate it?

I was almost about to consume it but the topping did not look familiar so it struck me that the pizza could be non-veg. Now since I do not consume non-veg, I raised the issue with Swiggy and demanded suitable compensation and removal of the non-veg pizza from my house. They said that they won't be able to remove the pizza but offered me the entire order amount as gift voucher (Rs 400 approx). I told them that the pizza should also be removed as a basic courtesy to which they declined.\n\nNow the matter is that we hear so many stories of such things happening in various other countries and the handsome compensation that is paid to the complainants in those cases.

        "title": "My wife went to India with my child from Canada in the name of vacation and when I asked for divorce due to our differences she is refusing to come back and I'm losing access to my child",
        "text": "I'm the father 35M wife is 34F both of us Indian citizens and married in India and are permanent residents in Canada and our daughter is 1.5yeara old is a Canadian citizen. Let me give you some context. I'm asking for a divorce because our relationship has deteriorated to the extent where we are not fighting only if we are not in the same room. I believe it's better for our daughter to grow up in a co-parenting relationship so that she won't grow up seeing her parents arguing all the time if we had stayed in the marriage just for her. Since I'm now asking for divorce, she doesn't want to come back to Canada saying she was here in Canada only for me. Moving to Canada was a long time dream for me and the primary reason was so that my children can have a better future with opportunities and freedom that I never had growing up. Me and my daughter have a very good relationship to the extent that she prefers me to be around than be with anybody else. She is the typical textbook example of daddy's girl but she is too young and still needs her mother. I was taking care of her mostly in the first 6 months and after that our parents came in to help. After she was a year old and when my wife started to work, I gave up my work from home job to train for a job that would increase my income potential and provide more for the family. She is calling my increased absence in home as me not having any love for our daughter and calls me a bad father. Mind you whenever I was with her I was there more than a 100%. \n\nI want to have 50% custody of my daughter but my wife is refusing to come back to Canada stating that she doesn't like Canada for the cold and she works from home and doesn't have friends here for a social circle if I'm not going to be with her. I think it's unfair that my daughter has to grow up without her father being involved just because of her mother's lack of friends here and the winter and make Canada sound like a country that refugees run away from. \n\nI want her to come here with my daughter. She can take the house that we bought for her to grow up in and I will pay for any child support payments. I love my daughter and just want to have her in my life at least 50% or more. \n\nShe has always earned more than me. She makes close to 140-150k a year or more these days and I make about 60-70k a year. Now since she moved to India and she refuses to come back to Canada, the company that she works for told her they can only pay her in Indian pay standards going forward which will of course be lesser than what she is earning here in Canada which would be an equivalent of at least 30k-40k CAD which is a very good salary to live in India (context: will easily be in top 10% of earners in India). She is also fully financially taking care of her mother who does not work and is kind of separated and her sister who is divorced and doesn't want to go to work and support herself. Now she is asking me to pay a fixed amount as child support in India by Ontario's standards. Even if I pay $500 which is affordable to me and to give you context that is good enough to rent a very good 2-3 bedroom condo in a big city in India, I'm definitely concerned the money won't fully be utilised for my child. I'm not trying to wiggle out of any child support payments and I know courts always side with the women and as a man I will most likely be in the losing end but I'm also asking help from the legal community here, is there anyway I get to be with my daughter in Canada irrespective of how much ever I have to pay in any support payments in Canada. If not and I have to pay her child support to live in India, will the Canadian courts see the purchase power parity in India and Canada and adjust the child support accordingly? I much rather split the child's actual expenses in India (which is what she states in another post in this group as me trying to avoid paying child support and me trying to control her expenses) and pay her that and invest the rest in Canada to give it to her when she turns 18. \n\nI also want to note that I respect my wife as the mother of my child and I want her to be involved in her life growing up and will never fight for full custody, I'm just asking that I also have the chance to be involved in her life growing up that does not need me to move back to India.",

The hotel had 2 incharge/owner (who were not present there) and a receptionist. The receptionist asked us for 1k but we already had spoke to the owner or incharge for 900 and this is important as when we called the incharge and he told her to charge 900 from us as we are regulars ( this infuriated the receptionist for some reason maybe the incharge was her brother in law or for whatever reason) \n\nShe gave us a room which was a bit small and we asked her to shift us to some other room and she complied. After this, everything went downhill.. the room in which we shifted was a total mess - the flush wasn't working, the tv/remote wasn't working, we complained about it and we asked for a soap to wash hands before eating and they were negligible about it for sometime and after asking for 2-3 times they gave us a small soap stating \" mam ne apni purse se nikal ke diya hai! \" \n\nWe were annoyed and called the incharge again told him to resolve the tv/remote and flush issue. He did tell us to take refund and shift to some other branch of that hotel but we refused as we were there for more 4-5 hours only and our time was already wasted. That's when the receptionist came and started shouting at my partner at the top of her voice screaming why have we called the incharge but it has been 2 hours and they were completely negligible about our issues. The other incharge came and fixed our flush and promised us the tv/remove will start working as soon as possible and he left. The receptionist and the workers made no proper efforts to fix the tv/remove and we let it go. Afterwards, when we were eating the paneer, the gravy was spilled (oil stains) and ruined the bedsheet which was completely our fault.  \n\nThe receptionist was a bit mad at us for calling the in charge and she switched off the mcb or whatever of our room. We stayed there or an hour or two without electricity afterwards we noticed the light was in other rooms and hallway but not in our room which made us a bit mad and my partner again complained about it to her and she was makin excuses and screamin at us that's it not her fault you were ones who asked for another room until this point my partner was the one doing all the talking and she was very disrespectful to him which made me a bit irritated and i retaliated and had a fight with her (i was also a bit disrespectful to her ngl) and thereafter she got furious and screamed go and call the incharge again. My partner did call the owner again and he told her to shift us to another room. \n\nWe shifted and again AC was not working and she switched off the WiFi so we weren't able to watch TV. We ignored and then she called my partner to the previous room where we stayed and asked him to pay 1k for the oil-stained bedsheet, he refuted and went from there. She called the incharge (the one who fixed our flush and maybe his husband/boyfriend) and spoke to him about the stained bedsheet. He called my partner and threatened him to pay 1k or else he'll go to his and my house with police and get the amount (he already had our aadhars so..) My partner did ask them to let him pay for the laundry bill as the oil stains are removable but they threatened to \"pay or else\" . We live with our parents and my boyfriend was a bit scared. Thus, he paid 1k for it.\n\nAny legal advice?",

Many were suspecting it as a made-up story, but it isn't. In the same city a guy was also arrested for waving a Palestinian flag a month ago, it hurted sentiments of some political group and he faced jail for it. i will comment the link to that story below",

Let me put it here\n\nIt’s a legit home stay service provider.\n\nI was not aware of any cancellation policy. They didn’t mention it to me. It was not present on the invoice I got. It was not present in the catalogue they showed me of the place. All in all It wasn’t explicit. If it was, I wouldn’t be making a post about it here.\n\nThe amount does not matter. It’s unethical to not refund the money without making the customer aware of the cancellation policy. I probably wouldn’t have booked the place had it been so conservative on cancellations. \n\nQuestion : Can I do anything on the legal front basis the fact that I was not explicitly made of aware of cancellation and refund policy when they took payment from me ?",

INR which makes it 850k+ USD. We have some property in rural area and some in urban. \n\nThough, after he passed away, it was all divided into 4 parts those 4 members include me, my mother and my 2 sisters. But by the norm, I am to inherit all the property. My mother and sisters agree with it. But I still want to do my married sisters good and give them some share once I get settled comfortably. \n\nBut the reason why I'm unable to get anything because I have zero property law knowledge, most of the documents are in Hindi from decades ago. I don't know anyone in this village, I don't know how to make property deals. I have been suffering a lot in my life and want to move abroad for a while to fix my mental state. The village I'm in is infamous for terrible people and property crimes. I don't want to get into all that hassle. \n\nBut I need some good amount of money to start a new life abroad. I'm requesting my brother in law to help me sell some part of the property because he had knowledge and connections but he doesn't. I'm so broken at this point that I just want to run away leaving everything behind my dad worked hard for me and never return. My mental condition keep deteriorating the more I stay here. \n\nTL;DR - I have all the indirect money in the world that I will need to start a new life anywhere but it's all non-liquid. The process of inheriting it to myself and converting it to liquid (direct money) is lengthy, full of hassles and risky. So, I have been thinking of giving up on it.",

        "text": "Hi. I need some guidance regarding a loan dispute of my close friend.\nBack story: \nShe took a favor from a guy she knew for sum of Rs.50k and she told him that she'll give it back in a month or so, but failed to do so since 15 months, due to financial issues, demise of her father and she losing her job, it has been tough for her to manage and pay it back. Yet she used to reassure him that she will pay it back once she arranges the amount, they were in touch for the next 5 months after the money exchange, later when the guy used to force himself on her she stopped communicating with him and even stopped meeting him. There is no evidence available where she can prove that the guy used to do this. There was mental harassment as well.\n\nNow, she received a whatsapp text from him, a legal notice drafted by lawyer, which does not have lawyers number, stating that she took a loan from him and failed to pay back, and she has never replied to his calls or texts about this (which is false) and she has 15 days of time from this notice to pay him back with interest and the lawyers and legal charges making up the amount to 70k, if failed to do so, he will proceed legally with multiple charges.\n\nUpon this she replied saying that she has mostly responded him that she will pay back, and now she is not in a position to repay the whole amount or any sort of interest but she will pay back 50k sum in installments and she transferred Rs. 5k to him.\n\nTo this the guy responds : \n\"If you had paid me Rs.50k today instead of rs. 5k I would have reconsidered about not taking interest from you and would have taken only legal expenses that would make the total amount to ₹62500 but you're still trying to delay this.\nAnd since I have already hired a lawyer and paid his fees, I will not let it go to waste, the LEGAL TIMELINE for you to pay me back is 15 days since receiving the legal message from me.\n\nSo I am being very clear here, either you pay me the whole amount along with interest back, or I will file a case against you. And we will directly meet in court then.\"\nLater says, he'll settle for 50k + 5k legal expenses and forget the interest but you have to pay it before 25th or he'll take it to the court.\n\nNow, she is literally not in a position to pay back the full amount in 10 days, she will be able to manage to pay it in installments. Now what options does she have? How can she proceed with such threatening and mental harassment? How can she ask for extra time?\n\nKindly share your inputs, it'll be highly appreciated. Thank you.",

        "text": "\nI live in Mumbai, Dahisar, and the society next to my building is exclusively for members of the Gowd Saraswat Brahmin community. They have strict rules, allowing only Brahmins from their community to live there as owners or tenants.\n\nFor the past month, some retired elders in their society have started chanting \"Shree Ram, Jay Ram, Jaya Jaya Ram\" every day for 2-3 hours, beginning at 3 PM. As someone who is also a Brahmin and deeply devoted to Hanuman ji, I completely respect their devotion and the value of spiritual practices. However, the tone they use is identical to \"Ram naam satya hai\" (used at funerals), which makes it sound depressing and distracting. It sounds as if they're forcing themselves to say it instead of saying it out of love or devotion.\n\nThe area is super silent around here, and their chanting is loud, repetitive, and resonates throughout the area. While I wouldn’t call it noise, because chanting the name of Shree Ram isn’t noise, but it’s still difficult to focus when it continues for hours on end.\n\nThis has become a significant issue for me because I’m juggling a part-time job, two master’s degrees, and preparation for a competitive exam. These afternoon hours are the only time I get to study with focus, but the chanting has been making it nearly impossible to concentrate. Unfortunately, there are no libraries or study-friendly spaces nearby where I can work instead.\n\nI want to emphasize that I don’t begrudge them their devotion, and I’m genuinely happy to see such dedication. I just don’t know how to manage this situation without disrupting their routine or causing any conflict.\n\nRequesting them to stop or lower the volume doesn’t seem like an option. Has anyone faced something similar or have suggestions for how I could handle this respectfully? I’d truly appreciate any advice.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": " \n\n[Forcible sex](https://www.easykanoon.com/is-forcible-sex-ground-for-divorce/) after marriage or ‘marital rape’ mainly refers to sexual intercourse between a man and a woman, who is legally accepted as husband and wife, without the consent of the women for that intercourse.\n\nThe ancient patriarchs who came together to write their early covenants had used the rape of women to forge their male power- how then could they see rape as a crime of man against a woman? Women were wholly-owned subsidiaries and not independent beings.*-Susan Brown Miller (Against Our Will)*\n\nMan and woman make up a society. They are the pillars that keep humanity standing on their feet. However, as time passed a war of proving who is the best among man and woman, a war between the two universally known genders then, started and slowly male chauvinism started taking over the absolute control of the society with power and opportunities and marking the women population as lowly, docile and submissive and thus, discrimination and a gender-based disparity was established. Which started out as a joint responsibility soon became an exhibition to show the subordination of women with respect to men in every field. To prove the greatness of men and how the world and humanity deserve to be dominated by them, soon, violence becomes their ultimate answer to prove their masculinity. The strength became the measurement of capability. For centuries it had been a way to dominate the female population and keep them in that subordinate place assigned to them by men to showcase their powers. The manifestation of female submission has been played, for centuries, as a historic power strategy to establish male domination all over the world. Even the relationship between men and women, their matrimonial wedlock, which is still held to be a holy union all over the world and regarded as a fulfillment of bond and the ultimate goal of every romantic relationship between two people, proved to be a strategic approach to keep women below men. Having a woman as a spouse gave men a bundle of special powers to suppress them in the name of the family or brainwash them into thinking how they were only made for taking the subordinate roles to their husbands",

He keeps me in a cheap 1 BHK rental and has no secret properties or investments that I know of. Most of his income disappears into a black hole. It's possible he has hidden crypto assets, or maybe he spends it on alcohol, gambling and sex spas. I just don't know and he doesn't tell me anything when I ask. He operates on a minimalist lifestyle - no maid, no car, no iphone, no jewelry, no vacations. He takes me to a cheap restaurant twice per month, and that's the extent of his frivolous spending on me. He pays for my food & rent in exchange for me doing all household chores and cooking his meals. I feel cheated because he didn't deliver on what was initially promised (our family with children). I'm planning to divorce him and ask for maintenance, but in the absence of any proof of his income and given the cheapo lifestyle he's maintained since the beginning of our marriage, will the court award me with enough money to survive on my own?",

As I got out of metro at next station a lot of people got out and i heard screams and death threats in female voice & saw a chubby girl doing that to a guy . The guy said it's crowded here and she continued to give really serious threats which even got me scared, then suddenly a chubby guy started attacking that stick figure guy like a machine gun while the gate closed and the girl stopped attacking him physically to stop the door from closing and magically they did stopped the door from closing. \nI felt sorry for the stick figure guy but can't really defend anyone in this because it was too crowded. \n\nHow can I do legally if i was in this situation?\n",

As even if you take legal action against them, they will get bail due to laws so I expect only one thing.\n\nI expect an advocate to be on phone call with policemen who will come here and will let me free by making me ride in their vehicle and leave me to khagaria junction from where I will take a train to start my new life because I don't trust police as you know that they have been taking bribes.\n\nI couldn't talk to police on 112 because of their unprofessional behaviour which is not a new thing known.\n\nThe address in my aadhar is of my mama which is not the place where I'm living now.\n\nI'm living at a different location where I'm imprisoned by my family with a threat to end my freedom . They have also fed me medicines which have resulted in many side effects just to satisfy their self correct image.\n\nAs you know that like Americans, we don't have guns to defend us so I'm helpless and if I lose this mobile then I will be trapped here forever.\n\nMy current address where I'm imprisoned is infront of pond which is between adarsh Inter College Ghailarh jiwachhpur and Phulkaha. Police station is gamharia and district is Madhepura.\n\nPin code is 852124 and the ward no is 4. My father's name is vishokanand and grandfather's name is late Upendra Yadav.\nMy father is the mastermind behind this who is accompanied by his relative Deepak living on his north side.\n\nI want to become a politician and pass laws that will punish the guilty without any bail such that the society will remain crime free and guilty will know that they will be punished.\n\nKindly allow Madhepura police to operate this as gamharia police station is famous for taking bribes and so are many police stations. And please please allow a good advocate who knows that everyone's life must exist in every moment and justice must be served to be at phone call with these police men while assisting this operation as I don't trust police.\n\nI can send you my real location through maps as well as my number.

Got some meds. Doctor was confused about my condition as I'm ok but had to give meds as it's his job. \n\nI have taken a challenge to revise that everyone's life must exist in every moment daily till medicines are running and overcome instincts created by these medicines as I think this can end madness in the world if mad people will follow it .\n\nWe must be free to do what must be done i.e. whatever's life leading for me and others.\n\nIt's not like I tried to be free but I wanted to give a message to the world about this whole incident so that it won't happen to anyone and go unnoticed as well as how to stop it from happening in future with anyone and how those who are actually mad can be helped. I hope those meds won't have much side effects.

        "text": "So a brief background. My first wife passed away many years ago when two of our daughters very very young. \n\nFew years ago I started dating another women and very early into the relationship she gets pregnant with our child. Initially as I had known her not for that long, so I refused to marry her. She anyway said that she wants to go ahead with this child and would like to bring this child up in a family. So we started living together.\n\nAt the time of delivery hospital staff, doctors repeatedly asked for the father of the child and with so much of explaining, and prioritising her mental health, and giving a child a legitimate name, I gave in to have some marriage registered.\n\nShe got hold of her three friends as witness and some priest from her temple to sign the forms and we registered the marriage with local municipality giving some arbitrary date as marriage date. No actually marriage under Hindu customs ever took place.\n\nSo say our daughter was born on 10th, our registration happened on 25th (after she was born), so as we don't face any hassle in giving her legal status.\n\nHowever it turned out that we were just not right for each other. Now few years down the line we have decided to live separately and given how things are this will mainly lead to a divorce.\n\nFor context, we both are working professionals and earn decent livings to provide for our kids and live a good life in a metro. I have more assets than her. \n\nAs long as it is mutual I am all for it, however if she suddenly starts asking for Alimony, by Hindu marriage act she can claim 1/3 of my assets. My lawyer has advised that this may get reduced as I am sole provider to my 2 daughters from my previous marriage, plus looking after my aging parents, so Alimony amount would get reduced substantially if I am able to show genuine liablities.\n\nMy question here is can alimony be nullified if I say we actually never got married under Hindu act, and registered marriage was only done to give me third daughter a legitimate name. Also if you see all witnesses and priest who signed the document were all from her side, which shows this was done under some duress that time.  \nI am ready to take 100% care of all my daughters.\n\nPlease advice.\n\n",

        "text": "**Wholeheartedly Apologies for my immaturity.....** to all the members for this sub who replied to help me, I really don't know the background of the property but well aware of the fights between my grandfather, father and taujis. I will consult more with my mother. I am not very much into what my family owns or whatever. My father gave me good education and simple lifestyle and seeing him tensed from few years my mood was off so asked here. He won't be telling anything directly about family tensions as he wants me do my own good and not get into family matters. Even knowing that we own this much my father wanted me to earn money through my job or whatsoever. That's why I regularly do freelancing & tutoring for my money. \n\nAbout property it mostly is non-agricultural land but near some state highway of UP and Bihar. In total it can be combined worth of 16-18Cr and rest 3-5Cr is a bungalow in good city. (Its not exact 21Cr but can range from 19-22Cr)\n\nThanks for overwhelming response, I am sorry that I can't reply anything useful regarding this. I thought **just for safety to know if there is some legal procedure if at last my father was really excluded.** But that would need more info. Apologies again.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ Earlier question was below.......\n\nMy grandfather is refusing to provide equal share to his three sons. The property to be inherited is worth \\~21 Cr (my mother said) (comprises of plain fertile lands, gutters or infertile land, and bungalows) to be (ideally) distributed among three but my grandfather says he will give it only to two elder brothers of my father. My father will be getting nothing.\n\nIf anyone wants the reason its simple that my father is short tempered and he often argues with my grandfather and also sometimes yells at him. When my grandfather says he won't get a penny of property he argues more. I feel sad seeing these state of affairs.\n\nIs there some legal route here so that my father can convince my grandfather, so that these family tensions can go away and equal distribution of wealth happens? My uncles (father's elder brothers) also internally don't want to share the property so they say they will do whatever my grandfather will decide (as it is anyway benefitting them).\n\nWe live a modest lifestyle and aren't poor but this property thing causes daily issues at home because my father's dream are big.",

        "text": "My parents kind of disowned me when I had a love marriage against their wishes, primarily due to concerns about horoscope predictions of an unsuccessful and bitter divorce.\n\nMy wife's parents own a small house in a tier 2 city. She tends to spend a lot, leading to regular financial arguments between us.\n\nWe live in tier 1 city and bought a house above my comfortable budget thinking that we both pay loan equally and have shared ownership. She initially borrowed some money from her parents for the down payment but I only pay the loan now and majorly paying up down payment and the house. After house possession in couple of years, we decided that I’ll contribute 40% and she will do 60%.\n\nShe has wavering mind. She always complain of her job a lot since we got married. So I don’t think she’ll stick up in the job for long. Or she’ll try to pursue something else which I don’t think will be fruitful as she has the interest but no clear plan or strategy.\n\nWe are in mid 30s and gonna have family planning soon. My fear is that in case we divorce after few years, should we go about the ownership of the house as we have planned or shall I convince her that I’ll own it and pay solely for the house while she can contribute to house expenditure as much as she can?",

        "text": "Iam facing a situation where the zeal to work hard is dying. the cumulative tax burden on our income and spendings is unfair. Initially, our income is significantly reduced by income tax, and on top of that, we do not receive any GST exemption on the goods and services we purchase or sell, leading to a scenario of double taxation. I want to understand the legal basis for challenging this issue and explore all possible arguments and examples that justify this appeal to the Supreme Court against the tax authority.\n   \nStraightforward this is totally unfair that sometimes we’ve to pay 18-27% on gst on an income which is already taxed heavily without any guarantees and benefits.\n   \nAnd finally after everything you want to have some world class stuff to make this life less miserable we’ve to pay custom duties on it.\n  \n\nIn summary, I am seeking a legal remedy that calls upon the Supreme Court to direct the tax authority to modify the taxation mechanism, where the tax payers get some sort of relief somewhere. This would include reconsidering the current framework under GST in light of income tax liabilities, or make some relaxation in custom duties, or make the tax like toll, road substantially reduced or something in similar front. thus ensuring that my effective tax burden does not amount to a double taxation scenario. My ultimate goal is to achieve a balanced and equitable tax system that aligns with constitutional principles and promotes a fair environment.",

        "text": "hey people of reddit, I have last question for anyone who might me able to answer it.\n\nWHAT WOULD BE THE EASIEST AND 100% SURE AND FOOL PROOF WAY OF KILLING MYSELF?\n\nI'm going to write down answers to all your questions so that you don't have to ask them.\n\n\nI'm 24M, I want to do this because I don't see any reason to continue living this miserable life. I've tried and failed so many times in my life and always have ended up in a worse spot than I was earlier. So far I've tried and failed in 3 different professions and have been failing since I was 14. Ever since I was in 6th grade I knew study wasn't something for me. Not that I was a bad at studies, till 5th I had topped my class and never fell below 3th rank, when in 5th I first announced that I don't want study further and would rather continue play some sport or learn some business. I was beaten by every single member of my family, a lot teachers from my school and even school bus driver who had come to drag me to school with my father. They changed my shool a year later, where I was dropped from football team in 10th (a team that I was captaining since 2 Years) because my maths teacher complaint to the principal about my low attendance and no performance in maths (I suck at math). So after 10th I quit school because the only reason I was going because I was playing football and they killed that for me at a crucial time when they where taking a district level team out, and they kept me out of it during the selection. Few months later during vacation I broke my leg to put a final nail in the coffin of my football journey. \n\nSince I couldn't go out I started playing video games, I was playing earlier as well when I didn't go to school, but that was for fun, now I was playing FPS (CS) and with more focus. In a few month I got better and started playing competitively (I ranked under 25 on game tracker in asia, LAN tourney, regional online tourney) Then started organising a few events ourselves. At this point I was on my own and didn't ask for any money from anyone(not that i had much expenses or got any pocket money earlier either), after sometime i with one of my friends started building our own map and game servers and was trying to get into the game development space. One night I was up either playing or working on a map when my father came in and beat the shit out of me, in next few days my PC and done for and I had nothing. Absolutely nothing at all. So I locked myself in my room and would stare at the ceiling day and night. I didn't do anything for over a year and one day ran away, I went to dehradun thinking I would meet my friends who where there but someone stole my phone around Delhi, I got off the train a few station before dehradun (it was standing for a long time to let pass some other train). The train left the station, I, 18.5 Y/O stood stranded 1100 kms away from home not knowing what to do I started walking on the railway track till I reached DDN railway station, there in 4 days I called my brother, who convinced me to come back.\n\n\nAfter some time I started working with a real estate agent as a sales exec. I was learning so he wouldn't pay me anything and I didn't mind it either, as I was getting better and got a grip on the trade covid lockdown happened. My father had just took VRS from his job in feb 2020. Now there's no one earning in the family. Once the 2nd lockdown was lifted I again started working with a real estate company, I earned some, lost a lot to their greed and theft. I worked with them for around a year, when I decided to form a team of my own and take my own marketing projects (my first business failure) I lost all my savings in a matter of a few months. I was in depression once again. \n\n\nI started working on myself for a sometime later joined a stock broking firm because I was done with the thief and goons of real estate. Within a 3 months I was promoted to TL, in next few months, one of the partners of the firm took upon a new venture and invited me to join him. I joined him, as soon as I joined him my salary went up 50% and overall earnings around 2-3x in the next 6 months I got promoted GM, heading the operations of this new venture everything seemed right but deep inside I wasn't happy. Around 8-9 months ago, my mother (has medical issues since past 15 years) and sister both were admitted in hospital for over 15 Days, I was already overworked in a job I wasn't very happy, I had 2 people in hospital, one on the verge of dying. All this and I get a very unpleasant and angry call from my boss and I quit right then and there. \n\nOver the next few months I spent a lot of time and money to start my own business in the same domain, I partnered with 3 people, out of whom 2 backed out after a quarter or so. I took some loans to keep the business alive. It's over 6 months I've been struggling, for a life I never enjoyed, earning for people who never loved me. I'm to the neck in debt, and recovery people are at my doors all the time, and everyone in my family making me feel like shit day after day. I don't think I have live to die a thousand different ways daily. So I ask you what is the best way to die, So far I've tried rat kill (I vomited violently felt lifeless but still alive). I've drank whole mosquito vaporizer liquid, didn't quite work. I've tried stabbing at my heart but couldn't generate enough power to penetrate. I'm afraid of height also there isn't many high-rise building that could give me a sure kill. Somebody on reddit said nitrogen gas would do the trick and would kill me  in my sleep without any pain, but at this moment that is out of my reach. There is carbon monoxide that could be tried but reports say that the survival rate is high and could cause brain damage. Help me with this one final request. I'm so done with this life. ",

I checked out this place few days ago and absolutely LOVED it. Although it was a little over my budget, I still went ahead. I spoke to the flatmates for almost 2 hours and didn't find any red flags and thought everything is as per my needs. \n\nI even put down a token amount of 25k before leaving the apartment when I went to visit. But the next day I did some math and realised that paying deposit, maintenance, rent and the setup cost for the apartment was too big of an amount (1.2 lakhs total upfront) for me to put upfront and that it is not a wise financial decision  to lock a big amount like that. \n\nSo I called the owner the next day to tell him I'm no longer interested and that he should refund my token amount. And he refused saying tokens are non refundable and that I should find a replacement and he would consider the token paid. \n\nHis property manager forwarded me this message earlier today\n\n\"The token is always non refundable as was conveyed to her prior transaction. The decision on her part was made after thought. \n\nA relatively big amount was quoted so that we don't entertain non-serious prospects and avoid situations exactly like this one.\nWe declined other people because of her and we face the loss due to her careless and hurried decision. She was not forced to put down the token, she did so as a functioning adult capable of taking decisions. \n\nIf decisions like this could be flipped, then what purpose would token amounts serve? It would be useless to collect tokens.\n\nThere are only two things we can do for her here:\n1. If she is able to find someone to take her spot from March 1st, we can accept and consider the entire token amount to be given to us by the replacement.\n2. We can refund 20k to her from our end if and only if we are able to find a replacement by March 1st. The 5k will be withheld as penalty charges for our losses.\n3. If we are unable to find a replacement by March 1st, the 25k is forfeited.\n\nHer unprofessional behaviour has cost us convertible leads. And hence there must be compensation for the same. \n\nIncase she disagrees to this arrangement, clarify to her that this is a civil matter not a cybercrime matter and that she should file it in the civil court. She will hear from my lawyer if and after she chooses to do so.\"\n\n25k token amount is big amount for me and cannot afford to lose it. What should I do? Any advice and help is highly appreciated.\n\nThanks",

The past few Indian Legal advice subs were very small with a miniscule amount of people so I didn't consider it. \n A distant (but close in that we talk online and on phone from time to time) family member has fears of having commited various crimes and has been depressed and suicidal for an entire year. And from his description , it very well seems like he did end up doing those things and doesn't know what to do. He's piss poor and afraid of the Indian legal and police system. I'm somewhat knowledgeable on the legal system but not as much and I'm also not in a position to provide financial support. What can be done to help him.he's only told me about it and his health seems to be in ruins? He's too scared to even seek help or look for what he can or can't do because of his institution that he's doomed. Honestly knowing his fears and what he's afraid of and did in detail , I think it makes a lot of sense for him to be this way right now. I'm the only person who knows about this. While I wasn't explicitly asked for help from him. His situation is deeply uncomfortable and I highly doubt he would be able to navigate through this alone. I surely don't want anything bad to happen to him\n\nEdit;; turns out his fears are not real and he didn't do anything and he's either way too gullible or  stupid to believe his friends when they lie to him lol",

Hindu marriage laws have been designed in such a way that women are always prioritised. Our lords who are so disconnected from society believes that women are incapable of cruelty and violence the same way men are capable of and hence considers gender when dishing out verdicts too. Word of mouth is more than enough to put any innocent guy, his siblings, their parents into jail and automatically rewarding custody of their children to the same evil in-laws and evil wife as a result with all their earnings too....\n So what are the odds that Indian men start\ntaking law into their own hands instead of the\ncurrent trend of unaliving themselves? The indian legal system has put them in such a state that\nwouldn't they start considering unaliving the wife and in-laws and then unaliving themselves. Isn't that a\nbetter alternative than the current biased laws. The men wouldn't lose their hard earned money, the parents wont be tortured by judges like atul subash case, the kid won't be raised to hate their dad by the evil in-laws who supported their evil daughter in all the fake allegations... How many non-sharia men\nwould start considering that alternative and wouldn't that be problematic for our society in the long run?",

Due to the argument, the flight got cancelled and I was detained for a day. Now 8 months later the said airline sent me an email demanding compensation of around 100000$ and blaming the flight cancellation on me tbh I was a muslim travelling in the said airline and felt their behaviour to be very racist. I'm worried now that they will sue me if I fail to pay it but I have no plans on going back to the said country. I am wondering now , can they sue me in Indian court ?\n\nEdit: Some people are accusing me of playing victim card here or what has all this to do with me being Muslim. I'd like to clarify that once the police was there and I was being taken away, I told them if I can get my carry on bag from the plane. They let me take it with me but in the letter I received , I'm being accused of making some statement regarding my carry on bag which alarmed the crew and they ordered the whole plane to be searched for bombs or something. How is asking to get my carry on bag = making a bomb threat ? Before accusing me of playing some victim card, ask yourself . If it was a european white guy asking to remove his carry on bag, would they have ordered a bomb squad for him as well ? They have mentioned in the letter that calling this bomb squad resulted in the plane being evacuated and caused it to cancel the flight. How am I liable for them cancelling the flight . I didn't make any threats or arguments and left the plane when the cops took me. ",

However, on **Day 1**, I suffered a **serious injury (Grade 3 ankle sprain -complete rapture of legament & hairline fracture)** while playing. The issue is not just the injury but **how the academy handled it:**\n\n1. The **coach saw me fall but did not assist or offer any medical help. Instead asked me to move out of the court and asked me to go home and sleep and by morning it would be good.** \n2. When I went to the **academy office for first aid**, they **had no ice pack or spray (Move spray was out of stock).**\n3. I had to **go home on my own, without any help or medical attention.**\n4. Later, when I visited a doctor, I was diagnosed with a **Grade 3 ankle sprain and a hairline fracture**.\n5. I reached out to the academy for a **refund**, but they said they have a **\"No Refund in Any Circumstances\" policy** (this is written on the bill/receipt).\n6. The **person I spoke to refused to give me phone number, name etc of the owner**\n\nI feel this is **clear negligence** on their part since they **failed to provide basic medical assistance** to an injured player.\n\n# My Questions:\n\n1. Can I **file an FIR** under **IPC Sections 336, 337, and 338** (negligence causing harm)?\n2. Can I **file a case in Consumer Court** under the **Consumer Protection Act, 2019**, for **\"deficiency in service\"** and demand a refund + medical expenses?\n3. Since their **No Refund policy** is written on the receipt, will that prevent me from getting a refund legally?\n4. If I **post my experience on social media** (Google reviews, Justdial, etc.), will that help put pressure on them?\n5. Any other legal options I should consider?\n\nWould really appreciate any expert opinions or experiences from people who have dealt with similar cases.\n\nThanks in advance!",

She is an Indian woman based in KL, she has been residing there for the last 18 years with her husband and two daughters. \n\nThey are both Indian citizens, married in India and marriage certificate also issued from India but they never lived in India for their entire married life. \n\nHer husband owns a property in Mumbai, the rest of the assets are in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (KL), including businesses, which she has worked for over the years without compensation. She has ownership over shares though. \n\nThe situation is that the husband has been emotionally abusive for many years now and my friend is finally fed up. She wants a divorce but believes it’s only right for the husband to pay alimony to support the two daughters since my friend is a housewife and has been so all along. \n\nShe has filed a divorce petition in KL but she will only find out towards end of the month if the KL courts believe they have jurisdiction over their marriage. \n\nMeanwhile, her coward of a husband has fled KL. He has gone to Mumbai and filed a divorce petition there. He has accused her of “cruelty” and other atrocious things and has said he wants a divorce based on this. He has not mentioned anything about his daughters or any offer of alimony, just baseless accusations. \n\nShe has received the court notice from Mumbai courts and has a hearing set for February sometime. \n\nMy friend cannot leave KL for two reasons: \na) She is the primary caregiver for the two daughters and wants to provide them as much stability as possible which means they attend school and do all their day to day stuff. \nb) She doesn’t have the financial means.\n\nShe is seeking advice on the following aspects: \n1)\tDo the Indian courts in fact have jurisdiction over their marriage even though they never lived in India? \n2)\tDoes a wife have any rights by marriage in India? \n3) Does she have to be physically present for the hearings in India? \n4)\tWill any judgement made by Indian courts be enforceable in KL? I.e. can she make a claim over both India and KL assets? Her main purpose is to secure financial support for the daughters until they complete college education. \n5)\tHow much, REALISTICALLY, does it cost to file for divorce in India? All lawyers she has consulted so far have quoted in LAKHS. She is a housewife, he controls their finances and she has little savings.\n\nAny other advice you might have for her?  She just wants to be free of this man but secure her daughters’ futures.",

        "text": "I ordered two pairs of Levi jeans from Myntra on December 7. \nLevi's Slim Slim ( A )\nLevi's Straight Fit ( B )\nOn December 13, my parcel was delivered. When I opened the parcel, the jeans were totally different from the ones shown in the photos, so I thought they were fake. I immediately registered a complaint with customer care. They asked me to upload photos on the Myntra app, which I did. I told them that I didn’t want a refund; I wanted an exchange. They said okay, but I had to wait 48 hours. I agreed to wait. \n\nOn December 15, I got a text message that my query had been solved. I checked the Myntra app and it said that they would pick up my item and refund my money. Instead of exchanging, they raised a refund. I didn’t want a refund; I wanted to exchange the jeans for the ones shown in the photos. \nSo I called customer care again and asked to speak to their supervisor. He refused and said that their support team had decided that they would refund my money and not exchange it. I told him that this product was fake, it was not the same as the photos, it was totally different. In frustration, I told him that I would complain to the consumer court. Then I hung up the call. After that, I cancelled the refund request on the Myntra app. After two days, on December 17, I saw an option to exchange the jeans. I thought that if I exchanged these jeans, I would get the Right ones (the ones in the photos). I exchanged one of Levi’s products ( A ). \nOn December 19, I got the exchanged item, but I was shocked. It was again the same jeans. The delivery guy told me to call customer care and say that I wanted to exchange my product and change its seller. I called customer care and told them the story. He said it's not possible to change seller and told me that their backend team would re-investigate it and I had to wait another 48 hours. I’m so frustrated. Why do I have to wait more? \n\nHere is the product link for which I exchanged: http://www.myntra.com/mailers/bottomwear/levis/levis-men-slim-fit-low-rise-light-fade-stretchable-jeans/21926916/buy ( A ) This is proof that I got a different product from Myntra. Its material does not match what Myntra has mentioned, as you can see in the image. Even the branding is different (I received Levi’s Red Loop jeans).\n The second product - http://www.myntra.com/mailers/bottomwear/levis/levis-men-straight-fit-stretchable-jeans/18973638/buy ( B )\nThis is a different product from what I ordered. The material does not match, and the manufacturer of the jeans is different. In the photos, you can see that it has four buttons instead of a zip, but the one I received has a zip. I don’t know why they sent me a different product twice. I only want the jeans that I ordered, not any other product. I have been waiting for 13 days.\n\n Seller Name - Vision Star Customer care keeps saying they sell authentic products, but I know that’s not true. But I received a totally different product from what I ordered. I'm attaching the image for reference to what I received. I'm tired of waiting. I demanded they send me the same product immediately. I want action on this. \n\nSo after this, I exchanged the product again, but still received a different product. I told him I didn't want a refund. I want to exchange products. They told me this is the seller's fault, so why do I have to suffer? I ordered during the Myntra EORS Sale. I want them to send me the Right product or please change the seller so I can get the same product that I ordered.\n\nOn December 18, I submitted an exchange request for Levi's Straight Fit Jeans ( B ). The jeans were delivered on December 23; this time, I got the right product. \n\nSo only one product left which is Levi's Slim Fit Low Rise Jeans ( A )so I complained on X (Formerly Twitter) and they responded that I'll get a call from their case manager. Later, I received a call and told them this is my 3rd time exchanging; please do something; I want my right product. They assured me that this time you'll get the right product but you have to wait till January 31st. I checked the Myntra app this time they cha5nge seller ( Vision Star to Levi's ) .. Earlier They had refused that the seller would not be changed but now They changed it.\nI kept asking why do I have to wait more? They Keep Saying It's part of the process..\nI agreed to wait.\n\n On December 30th,  I received the product but again it's different. I'm so frustrated why do I get a different product again? This is not my fault; why do I have to suffer this? Myntra should send me the right product. I am so frustrated; \n\nCompensation for Mental Agony and wasting my Time\n\nI got these jeans  in 1618 INR\nNormal price without sale is 6500+ INR\n\nNow what should i do ?\nI already complained 3 times in consumer court but no help .",

However, my payout has been low on Swiggy even though the sales have been decent.\nEg. out of 1 lakh sales, swiggy only paid me around 27k. The rest they took as service charge and additional charges.\n\nOne checking on these details, I found out thst Swiggy has applied coupons and additional service packs/ add ons without our knowledge. When I confronted them about this the POC and support gave me a lazy response and told me “the previous POC/ employee had added these by mistake around 2020 time” and that we should have told them earlier itself.\n\nHow do they expect us to know the mess up from their ex employee? We were never informed about additional packs added and found it out on our own only?\nI don’t feel it is right from Swiggy’s part to make changes on the business offers and additional priority packs without permission or acknowledgment from my father’s side. My father has never confirmed or requested for any additional packs or freebie discounts which Swiggy has added without permission. We work with Zomato as well and have never faced anything like this before.\n\nImagine the sales we’ve made all this while and how much Swiggy has been leaching off us with their “service packs” which they added without consent. How is this fair ? The negligence from Swiggy and their employee to make changes to my business without our permission has resulted in them unfairly taking huge portion of our sales.\n\n\nIn short, Swiggy made changes to our business by adding discounts and additional service packs without any permission and acknowledgment from my feather. They now say it’s our fault even though it was the mistake of their ex employee/ previous POC.",

He stopped giving her money for luxuries and even for basic expenses, despite spending plenty on himself.\n\nPriya tried to stand up for herself and ask for a divorce, but raj cleverly claimed that he didn't own anything and didn't take any income from the family business. This meant that even if Priya asked for alimony, there would be no way for her to receive it. She suffered mental and emotional abuse at the hands of her husband, and her once-promising life had become a living nightmare.\n\nNow, at the young age of 27, Priya is faced with an ultimatum from raj. He plans to move to the USA to study and has told her that she can either serve his parents or get lost. Priya is devastated and unsure of what to do, but she knows that she cannot continue to live in this toxic relationship. She must find a way to escape and rebuild her life on her own terms\n\n\nHow can she get compensated to restart her life?

Therefore only one person was allowed to board the train and the other wasn't.

Since, I did not know about this rule, there I did not receive any money for the ticket that did not get confirmed. As it happens with most terms and conditions, general public like me don't go through them entirely but I do not understand the logic as to why IRCTC gets to keep the entire money and also not allow the passenger to board the train. IRCTC customer executive informed me that the TTE knows about it and they issue something called TDR but the TTE did not inform the passenger who was traveling on the train regarding the rules either.

Adultery is no more a criminal offence but is a good ground for divorce. The government cannot bring back the adultery laws as it would be unconstitutional after the Supreme Court's judgement in Joseph Shine. A major individualistic approach was taken by the Court in this case recognizing the women's right to sexual autonomy and right over her reproductive parts under Article 21 of the Constitution. This gives her the right to sleep with whoever she wants. This right is directly detrimental to the institution of Marriage and tries to adopt the western approach ignoring the Indian ethos.\n\nI hope that in future such position of law is changed by the Supreme Court otherwise God bless India!!  \n\n\nEdit 1: I don't have the time to comment and fight the misandrists who haven't even read the summary of the Judgement. I simply want to put one question before them...Can a marriage survive if people are allowed to commit adultery? If your answer is yes, then you should be ready to bear illegitimate Children.",

I do not believe in borders.\n- I've pondered the idea of getting some type of deterrent, like a dog, but I'm unsure if that would be effective or just create more problems.\n- The goats are dumber than most I've encountered.\n\nIf the goats ram towards me, can I argue self-defense?",

        "text": "\n\nFor the context, I was married for 1.5 years and have been saperated since a year. My baby is currently 1.5 y/o and have been going through a nasty divorce... he is accusing me many false things. I was accused that I had alcohol during pregnancy, habit of going out without telling him ,  has weird habits of watching corn and toys and was accused of assault against my husband. He accused me of lacking a hygiene, he even mentioned that i have wierd habit of farting infront of his guests in the divorce notice etc... all nonsense bullshitI never did any of them except for owning a toy. Infect he and my inlaws harrassed me and my parents for dowry. Restricted my phone calls, denied me from accepting baby shower gifts from my parents and what not. He goes crazy when he is mad and throws things around wile hurling verbal abuses. He is highly educated from a very reputed (graduate from one of the top 5 universities in the world). he was controlling af. And when I came back to my parents house when my child is 6 mo the old he held onto both my babyand my passports and all the other personal documents..like all of them social security, education degrees and my American visa also expired .. forgot to mention my baby is an American citizen and I was working .. he Essentially destroyed my career, my hard-earned degree, tuition fee, my 1 kg of gold is also with him. And HE INITIATED DIVORCE accused me of cruelty against him. Now he sent another notice asking me to send  my bank details so that he will send the child support money and that he and his parents wants to have interim.custody of 2 weekends every month. Eventhough my baby is very young, I am afraid he has bad intentions in asking for this..I thinks he wants to gain any evidence or the chance to fabricate some false evidence against me to steal my child from me or to make my life even more miserable by polluting my child's mind. I want to make negotiations about money. He robbed me of 4 years hardworking of my life, my studies(from USA, i am from india), my job, my 1 kg gold and 2 kgs silver, and additional responsibility of my baby. And his lawyer is ruthless and very strong one. He has money and he is willing to spend on these legal things..Whereas my patrbts are old and have no strength to fight, I have no job yet, my baby's temporary visa was expired and is an illegal resident now...I am weak mentally and financially.  HELP ME. how can I avoid giving the interim custody for now.. I am okay to visitation after everything is settled, like legally and monetarily. I don't want him to take advantage of me\n..please help me how to negotiate this..",

How does it save the individuals in an unfortunate circumstance of a divorce?\n\nUpdate 1: As pointed out by the community, it seems like there is no concept of prenup in India, dang those Hollywood movies. \nThere has to be something that can be done before the marriage though??\n\nUpdate 2: Thanks for the healthy discussion! It seems like there does not exist any such law in India. There were some references to transferring assets to mom, but it would only work out if it's done at least 3 years before the marriage. Also, thanks to the lawyers who reached out, it seems like there does not seem to be a straight forward way, and it depends a lot on the judge who is seeing your case.",

        "title": "How to Protect Yourself from Property Fraud in India: A Step-by-Step Guide",
        "text": "Buying property is a big deal, but what happens if the documents turn out to be fake? Property fraud, especially involving forged documents, is a real issue in India, and the consequences can be financially and emotionally draining. If you’ve fallen victim to property fraud or want to avoid it, here’s a simple guide to help you out.\n\n# Steps to Take if You're a Victim of Property Fraud\n\n**1. Report the Fraud to the Police** The first thing you need to do is file an FIR (First Information Report) at your local police station. This is what officially kicks off the investigation. Make sure to mention the sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) that apply:\n\n* Section 420: Cheating and dishonest inducement of property\n* Section 467: Forgery of documents\n* Section 471: Using forged documents\n\nThese legal provisions help the authorities investigate the fraud and catch the criminals involved.\n\n**2. Verify the Sale Deed** Head to the sub-registrar’s office where the sale deed was registered. If the documents are fake, the registration can be canceled. The sub-registrar’s office is key in identifying fraud, so it’s worth checking if the documents were properly registered.\n\n**3. Take Legal Action** To reverse the fraud, you’ll need to challenge the sale in court. A civil suit can help:\n\n* Declare the sale deed invalid\n* Reverse the transaction, either returning the property to you or stopping the fraudster from selling it\n\nThis step is essential to ensure your legal rights are protected.\n\n**4. Verify Ownership of the Property** Check the property’s title deed at the Land Records Office to ensure the seller is the rightful owner. This can uncover any inconsistencies that indicate fraud. Confirming ownership is crucial before moving forward with any transactions.\n\n**5. Hire a Property Lawyer** A good property lawyer is worth their weight in gold. They will:\n\n* Help with the FIR and legal paperwork\n* Collect evidence like forged documents\n* Represent you in court\n\nHaving expert guidance can save you time and effort, ensuring the process runs smoothly.\n\n**6. Seek Compensation** If recovering the property isn't possible, you can still seek compensation. A civil suit can help you recover:\n\n* The money you paid for the fake property\n* Additional damages for stress, legal fees, and other losses\n\nYou shouldn’t have to suffer financially just because of someone else’s scam.\n\n**7. Prevent Future Fraud** Once your case is resolved, take some steps to prevent this from happening again:\n\n* File a caveat with the sub-registrar to stop any future fraudulent sales of the property.\n* Keep an eye on property ownership records to catch any unauthorized changes.\n\n**8. Don’t Wait Too Long** Remember, there’s a time limit to take legal action. You typically have three years from discovering the fraud to file a complaint. Delaying it could harm your chances of getting justice.\n\n# How to File a Complaint Against Fake Documents\n\nIf you’ve been scammed with fake property documents, follow these steps to file a complaint:\n\n* **Authenticate the documents**: Check with relevant authorities to confirm whether the papers are genuine.\n* **Gather evidence**: Collect copies of the forged documents, payment receipts, and communication with the seller.\n* **File the complaint online**: Many states allow you to submit complaints online. Check the specific process in your area.\n\n# Tips to Avoid Property Fraud:\n\n* **Verify the seller’s identity**: Check government IDs to ensure they match the title deed.\n* **Use trusted brokers**: Work with brokers who have a good reputation. It’s worth doing a background check.\n* **Hire experts**: Legal and property consultants can spot issues that might be missed otherwise.\n\n# How Zolvit Can Help:\n\nProperty fraud can be overwhelming, but you don’t have to go through it alone. Zolvit offers expert support in navigating the legal process, ensuring that your documents are properly checked, and representing you in court if needed. Our team can help you recover losses and protect your rights.\n\nDon’t let property fraud derail your plans. Contact Zolvit today for the help you need.",

However, she repeatedly postponed her move, citing family events. Eventually, she refused to return to our matrimonial home, claiming she didn’t want to live there without me and didn’t marry to serve my parents, despite them treating her like a daughter.\n\nMonths later, I visited India, but we hadn’t spoken during that time. Her father came to discuss the situation, bringing several relatives, which upset us as it made a private matter public. After heated arguments, I compromised, giving her another chance, and she agreed to join me in Europe. However, she again delayed and never returned, continuing to blame me and my parents for everything.\n\nThe situation escalated when her family started defaming us publicly and threatening me. They demanded I return to India for discussions, where she expressed her desire for separation. They refused to talk over the phone and even filed a case against me (I came to know this after the mediation process), demanding a large sum of money. Despite mediation, which was biased in her favor, I respected the mediation, hoping for improvement.\n\nHowever, her behavior didn’t change, and she still harbors mistrust on me and resentment towards my parents. After trying everything, I’ve asked her for a peaceful settlement, but I’m unsure what complications may arise if she refuses. She has left our matrimonial home twice in 2.5 years of time span. We don’t have children.",

        "text": "My sister and her husband have been living separately for the last 6 months. He left my sister in January without clarifying the reasons. While leaving the house, he didn't take any of their shared belongings - he just said he wanted to leave and didn't want anything. Now, after 6 months, he wants everything back. He invested in a property with my sister, so he wants his share back (7-8 lakhs, its in my sister's name), and he also wants the car, which he bought (current value 5-6 lakhs, currently in my sister's name), as well as some household items (worth 50k-60k).\n\nMy sister says she has been paying the rent (around 14-15L for all the years) and many of his expenses for the past 7 years. He changed his career after their wedding, starting from the bottom, and didn't earn much for most of the marriage. However, he says that doesn't matter and he just wants his assets back.\n\nFor the past 2 months, he has been texting and calling all our family members to pressure them (even abusing them sometimes). He even came to my sister's house late one night, banging on the door to get his things. My sister filed a complaint at the police station the next morning. The police conducted counseling, but it didn't help. He didn't return to the police station for further counseling.\n\nNow, his friends are suggesting a mutual divorce, returning everything he asked for, and moving on, as both of them don't want to live together. Our friends also say there is no point in going to court as the case will just go on forever with no results, and you will waste your life. What is the best course of action here?",

My friend is unwilling to pay this and is calling it my problem. He is asking me to put an FIR to zoomcar and all that. I am scared to do because first of all i didnt drive and hit the car. and i have heard that having FIRs will impact future visa processes and so on. How do I deal with my friend, tell him that payment for towing needs to be done. The sakleshpur locals are saying that the longer the car stays there, more likely that the car parts will be gone.
